With an adjusted annual median household income of $41,341, our renters depend on the availability of affordable housing. As housing costs continue to rise (up to 37% increase in median rent from 2010 - 2021), our residents face an ever-increasing rent burden – 21.5% of residents spend more than 30 percent of their income on rent and 29.6% of residents spend more than 50 percent of their income on rent. While East Harlem's real median gross rent of $1,220 is lower than average NYC gross rent, it is still out of reach for many in our community. A limited supply of available affordable units combined with ever-higher rents and units lost to deregulation feed concerns about displacement and spotlight the mounting need for affordable housing in CD11.  Preservation of affordable and public housing, as well as the construction of new, deeply affordable housing, including opportunities for affordable homeownership, are incredibly important to ensure that current residents are able to continue to live in East Harlem. Seniors, many of whom are living on fixed incomes, are especially in need of permanently affordable housing so that they can age in place and peacefully enjoy their later years.   It is imperative that the Mayoral administration continue the focus on preserving and developing affordable housing units but also work diligently toward bridging gaps to ensure affordable units are meeting the need for deep affordability across household compositions, most urgently for family-sized units. Combining these strategies is essential to mitigating the displacement resulting from ever-increasing housing costs, stagnant wages, and unchecked gentrification.  Affordable Housing Preservation   Housing displacement is a constant concern for too many in our community. Those residing in rent-regulated housing are often faced with deteriorating housing conditions left unaddressed by unscrupulous landlords seeking to deregulate those units in pursuit of charging market rates. The City must continue to support and expand anti-tenant harassment protections, particularly for lower-income tenants who are the most vulnerable. The city must also remain diligent in pursuing opportunities to extend contracts to ensure existing affordable housing remains rent-regulated for the long term.  Affordable Housing Development  While much-needed affordable development has resulted from Mandatory Inclusionary Housing (MIH) and the 2017 East Harlem Neighborhood rezoning, there remains a need to create significantly more units of deeply affordable housing to serve low-income and very low-income households and supportive housing for vulnerable populations including seniors. The new ShareNYC program should be expanded to provide more opportunities for the development of affordable shared housing for low to moderate-income households.    Public Housing    The New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) remains the critical permanent affordable housing lifeline for thousands of East Harlemites. Public housing accounts for more than one-third (31.6%) of rental apartments in CD11; higher than Manhattan (8.8%), and Citywide (7.4%). As of 2023, East Harlem is home to approximately 32,259 public housing residents.   However, after decades of underfunding and mismanagement, public housing continues to suffer from neglect and a lack of necessary repairs. Essential services like heat and hot water, working elevators and maintenance repairs are frequently lacking or unsatisfactory impacting the safety and quality of life for residents. With over $32 billion in capital needs citywide, and only up to $2.56 million allocated to future commitments within this district for upcoming NYCHA projects. Our office regularly receives complaints from NYCHA residents regarding mold, broken elevators, lack of heat and hot water, general repairs, and less-than-adequate security measures.  It is vital that NYCHA work with the affected housing developments and community stakeholders, including CB11 when planning and executing each of these plans. As of this writing, several PACT projects are underway and planned for NYCHA campuses in CD11, including the Corsi Houses, Jackie Robinson, and UPACA senior developments. ","Crime and Public Safety","","Over the summer of 2023, we collected public input through a District Needs Assessment Survey. Over half of the respondents (51%) indicated that crime and public safety are among the top three most pressing needs in East Harlem, citing gun violence, substance misuse in our playgrounds and on our sidewalks, open-air drug dealing, petty crimes, and traffic violations impacting pedestrian safety.   Residents claim not feeling safe or comfortable traveling throughout the district by themselves or with their children, especially at night. Concerns about safety and an inability to feel comfortable in their environment negatively impact residents' quality of life. Further, parents worry about raising their children in proximity of public drug use and sales and the presence of street homelessness.   Residents have reported mixed responsiveness by the police, and maintain a lack of trust of police within East Harlem. Many continue to advocate for the expansion and strengthening of police-community relations through events and programs such as National Night Out, or the NYPD Police Athletic League (PAL); including increased police presence throughout the district to deter criminal activity, and foster relationships with residents and businesses that build trust.  Elements of the built environment also factor into feelings of unsafety among residents, including poorly lit areas due to broken street lamps, and the obstruction of lighting by poorly maintained street trees. DOT, DOB, NYCHA, the Parks Department, and the MTA must work together to ensure that our sidewalks, streets, parks, and open spaces, including the areas under the Park Avenue Viaduct, are properly lit and maintained.","Homelessness","","According to the Coalition for the Homeless, by May 2023, there were 89,951 homeless people sleeping each night in the New York City municipal shelter system, a 60.4% increase from July 2022. All told, the city said it had 105,800 people in its care as of July 2023, including asylum seekers and longer-term residents."" (As Homeless Population Booms, NYC Steps Closer to an Accurate Shelter Census, City Limits).  Many factors contribute to homelessness including a lack of affordable housing, poverty, unemployment, eviction, a history of incarceration, violence and abuse, substance use disorder, mental illness, or untreated medical issues. Public policy has also directly contributed to the crisis of homelessness in New York City, including reductions in government housing assistance, deinstitutionalization, and the decline of Single-Room Occupancy Housing (SRO's). These policy changes most directly impacted the very lower income individuals and households that most heavily relied on the availability of those affordable housing options.  Communities like East Harlem which suffer from concentrated poverty and are further burdened with high crime rates, poor health outcomes, and poor housing conditions are especially vulnerable to the impacts of the homelessness crisis. It is incumbent on the City and State to fund and support initiatives and organizations working to assist individuals and families to overcome these socio-economic challenges.  The City must prioritize the development and preservation of deeply affordable housing as the most appropriate, responsible, and cost-effective way to provide for those most in need and directly address the homelessness crisis. It is vital that the City expand eviction prevention services for low-income residents to remain in their homes, including providing rental assistance and legal services.  To further reduce the shelter population and help to stabilize families experiencing homelessness, the City must accelerate its efforts to transition families from shelter to permanent housing. This can be done, in part, by converting Tier II residences, which provide temporary housing accommodations and social services to homeless families until viable housing alternatives become available, to permanent supportive housing operated by reputable, local not-for-profit housing providers. It is essential that homeless shelters provide safe accommodations free of pests, rodents, mold, and violence. It is incumbent on the City to require that shelter operators provide on-site wrap-around support services for shelter residents. Operators must be required to provide the necessary facility maintenance and security to provide a safe and healthy environment for shelter residents during their stay. As a condition of their contract, operators should be required to establish community advisory boards in coordination with their respective community boards, to include representations from relevant community stakeholders.  While it is the collective responsibility of society to do for those in most need, it is not acceptable that support services including homeless shelters be concentrated in lower-income communities and communities of color like CD11  Street Homelessness  Sadly, street homelessness has increased throughout the city and locally is most evident along CD11's commercial corridors of 125th Street, 116th Street and 110th Street; and our public parks, mostly urgently in Harlem River Park and Marcus Garvey Park. Many of the street homeless population suffer from untreated mental illness and substance use disorder. Many others are undocumented immigrants without resources to secure housing.  The City must increase its street homeless outreach efforts in order to more effectively engage with this population including providing non-congregant shelter housing options, such as Safe Havens, for those who may be resistant to that type of shelter environment but can otherwise live independently. Funding must be allocated to support operators in mitigating the impacts of concentrating social services in a specific geographic area. Unfortunately, there are many who prey upon the most vulnerable when and where they are receiving the services they depend on to secure and support their recovery and stabilization. As such, it is not sufficient to merely site and provide the services but also to ensure that our most vulnerable neighbors are protected from those who may wish them harm.  ","","","","Done!","Mental health and substance abuse treatment and prevention programs","","There is an oversaturation of mental health and substance abuse treatment and prevention programs in CD11 which has created a strain on community resources and contributed to a range of quality of life and public safety concerns. The City's current siting policy is irresponsible to the individuals in need of care and also to host communities oversaturated with other services.   CB11 has called on OASAS and other regulatory agencies that have oversight over such programs, to implement an immediate moratorium on the siting of any new drug rehabilitation, chemical dependency, or treatment centers to be located in CD11 and require all existing OASAS-authorized drug rehabilitation, chemical dependency, and treatment centers, to come before CB11 prior to all reauthorizations and/or expansion of services or service capacity.  CB11 recognizes the need for treatment and support services but maintains that these should be equitably provided and not concentrated in low-income communities such as East Harlem. A condition of the contracts for providers of these services must be that they are engaged with community stakeholders including this board, to work together to address community concerns related to the center operated by the provider and its clients.  The City should aim to establish a crisis intervention program with a dedicated emergency call number for responses to mental health crises, which pairs peers with lived mental health experience and emergency medical technicians, to de-escalate mental health crises. Such a program would relieve the police department of responding to such cases for which they are not trained and do not require law enforcement engagement. However, police officers must be trained to assist on mental health crisis calls where law enforcement is requested.  The City must establish a comprehensive mental health services infrastructure across the city so that individuals living with mental illness can more dependably access the range of services they require. Much of the street homeless population is living with untreated mental illness often because of a resistance to care but also because of the lack of accessibility of care. It is imperative that the City prioritize providing accessible mental health care and support services, as well as special needs housing throughout the city and not just mostly in lower-income communities of color where resources are already stretched thin and so many other challenges are pervasive. ","The COVID-19 pandemic underscored the health inequity that is systemically entrenched in CD11. According to the 2020 Summary of Vital Statistics for the City of New York: this district suffered the highest COVID-19 mortality rate in Manhattan (273.4 per 100,000) - 25.6% greater than the citywide average (203.5 per 100,000). Compounding upon the disparity, Upper East Side residents typically enjoy among the highest life expectancies in Manhattan-87.3 years-while in East Harlem, the life expectancy is only 78.3.  According to the 2018 Community Health Profile report East Harlem's premature mortality rate (death before age 65) is 70% higher than NYC, driven by higher death rates due to cancer, heart disease, HIV diagnoses, accidents, and drug-related deaths. Relative to the five wealthiest neighborhoods, 42% of deaths could have been averted in CD11. The asthma emergency department visit rate among children ages 5 to 17 in East Harlem is 1.6 times greater than the citywide rate, (580 vs 223 per 10,000 children). According to the 2018 Community Health Profile report, ""Many childhood asthma emergency department visits could be prevented by reducing the presence of pests, mold, other asthma triggers...""; ""resources and opportunities are at the root of good health"", these include secure jobs with benefits, well-maintained and affordable housing, safe neighborhoods with clean parks, accessible transportation, healthy and affordable food, and quality education and health care"". In CD11, a significant portion of our vulnerable residents lack such resources.  Federal initiatives to expand health care to the uninsured must be supported locally through the equitable distribution of health insurance navigator programs to reduce the high number of uninsured residents. According to the 2018 Community Health Profile, ""in East Harlem, 12% of adults are uninsured and 14% report going without needed medical care in the past 12 months...""  DOHMH and Health and Hospitals should work to promote greater use of primary care physicians and expand the availability of urgent care programs to reduce the strain on local emergency rooms and decrease the number of avoidable hospital visits.  Additional funding should be targeted to expand existing community-based, peer-led preventive interventions to promote weight loss and prevent diabetes. DOE should devote more resources to develop physical education programs for all local schools and expand organized athletics. It is recommended that HPD and NYCHA host a series of workshops to educate tenants and landlords on the various indoor triggers for asthma and how they can be mitigated, including pest control. Funding should be increased for pest extermination and mold remediation services throughout NYCHA developments. Funding should be allocated towards education and awareness for children and families suffering from the symptoms of illness that can directly and/or indirectly be traced to conditions in public housing. ","According to the 2021 ACS 1-year estimate, seniors aged 65 and older now account for 15% of East Harlem's population. 28% of our community's seniors are living below the federal poverty line, more than double the rate of New York (12%). In addition, seniors in East Harlem also face high rates of social isolation, and have many concerns about safety in the community, which compounds the isolation issue. Almost 32% of East Harlem seniors are mobility-impaired compared to 26.5% citywide; in-home delivery of services are critical and senior facilities and programs need to be accessible to those with mobility concerns. There is also a need for culturally appropriate, bilingual social work and case management; increased access to dietary and religiously appropriate food options through meals on wheels and other services; and the need to expand home check in and home healthcare hours so those who are too afraid to leave their apartments for wellness visits.  According to the DoHMH's Surveillance Annual Report 2021, East Harlem suffers among the highest HIV diagnoses, prevalence, and age-adjusted mortality rates in NYC. Senior citizens are especially an overlooked population when it comes to addressing the HIV/AIDS epidemic, as individuals 50 and older accounted for 17.1% (up to 2 out of 10 people) of total HIV diagnoses as of December 2021. The report further shows that the same demographic had the highest rate of any age group for concurrent new HIV/AIDS diagnoses in NYC (31.6%) as of December 2021. This indicates that senior citizens are not getting tested early enough for HIV. CD11 has a high death rate from HIV/AIDS, and more targeted interventions and campaigns are needed to address this issue. Senior centers and assisted care facilities should be educating their residents about safe sex practices to reduce the risk of infection. ","","East Harlem's housing-insecure and low-income residents are at great risk of homelessness with 2021 real median gross rent (RMGR) calculated at $1,220 (a 15% increase from the RMGR of 2010; and an 18% increase from 2019), while approximately 31.2% of family incomes are below the federal poverty line. Currently, 29.6% of renter households in East Harlem are severely rent-burdened, spending more than 50% of household income on rent; and 21.5% are moderately rent-burdened, spending more than 30% of household income on rent. (ACS 1-year estimate, 2021)  Furthermore, there is a growing disparity between the RMGR, and real median household income (RMHI) in CD11. Since 2006, RMGR saw significant increases above 40%; while RMHI remained relatively stagnant though with significant declines (up to -20%) during periods of economic recession.     The COVID-19 pandemic has only exacerbated pre-existing racial and economic inequities and highlighted the need to protect and expand the City's social safety net. Cash assistance, rental assistance, and eviction prevention programs, anti-tenant harassment and code enforcement should also be prioritized as key components of the fight against the displacement of our lower-income residents..  With the full implementation of the City's Right to Counsel legislation, all cases that are moving forward in Housing Court will be assigned lawyers regardless of tenants' income, zip code, or immigration status. Still, the legislation is limited to tenants brought to housing court by their landlords due to non-payment. There is a need for pre-emptive legal services for tenants in need of building repairs. ","","","","Done!","After school programs","","After school programs support social, emotional, cognitive, and academic development, reduce risky behaviors, promote physical health, and provide a safe and supportive environment for children and youth. After school programming also supports working parents, especially single parents, who might otherwise have to choose between earning income and taking care of their children. In CD11, 57% of families with children under 18 are headed by a single parent. About 43.4% of families with children under 18 years old live below the poverty level; 31.3% of those families are single-parent households (2021 ACS).  Additionally, East Harlem youth face safety concerns due to the high rates of violence and gang activity, especially in public housing. To address the unique challenges, the community and City must work together to improve after-school programs, provide opportunities for youth employment, and increase extracurricular educational services. Job training and placement programs and other youth activity initiatives should target public housing developments and other areas with high gang activity to encourage positive development and p]revent negative outcomes. DYCD should expand after-school and evening programming, provide viable alternatives to disconnected and at-risk youth and target older teenage students with evening recreational activities.   Finally, there is a lack of physical spaces for youth to spend constructive and safe time in during after-school hours, weekends and summertime. Developers should be incentivized to work with nonprofits to build these needed facilities and provide programming.","Students in East Harlem struggle academically. Approximately 42.9% of students in East Harlem (3rd through 8th grade) are passing their reading exams, while only 37.3% of students are performing at grade level in math (Citizens' Committee for Children of New York, Inc., 2019). Challenges for students have only been exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic, especially for homeless students, students with disabilities, and students with other special needs. CCC New York further reports that there are 11,606 children living in poverty (2.8% of citywide); 276 families with children living in homeless shelters (2.4% of citywide) in East Harlem; while 1,790 students are living in temporary housing (1.8% of citywide).  As of 2021, 5,985 of our students receive Individualized Education Programs (IEPs) (2.6% of citywide); while approximately 22,477 individuals over the age of 5 years are of limited English language proficiency (1.3% of citywide). DOE must dedicate additional resources, including special education teachers, on-site mental health care providers, and other tools to overcome language barriers for our students with special needs and their families to ensure their academic and socio-economic success. We should expect these needs to gain higher priority due to the current influx of asylum-seeking families with students.  East Harlem's low academic performance can partially be attributed to our district's rate of chronic absenteeism. With 31.1% of District 4, and 39.5% of District 5 students considered chronically absent, East Harlem's chronic absenteeism rate is higher than the rate for NYC overall (26.5%). Furthermore, the rate of absenteeism is considerably higher for our students with disabilities at 40.4% for District 4, and 47.7% for District 5 (37.3% for NYC overall). Missing too many days of school can cause students to fall behind, increasing their risk of dropping out, and further harming their quality of life.  Low educational attainment contributes to a cycle of unemployment and poverty that becomes increasingly difficult to change with each generation. Educational attainment in East Harlem begins to fall behind as early as nursery and preschool (East Harlem Neighborhood Plan, p 45). It is estimated that children under the age of 5 years in East Harlem, only 25% are enrolled in private or public early learning programs (2019-2020 ACS). We argue that the earlier our children are able to start their education, the further it will improve the educational attainment within this district.   The Department of Education should continue to expand its focus on STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) and include more arts, music, culture, local history, special education programs, financial education and vocational training. Considering East Harlem's diversity in population, it's important that East Harlem schools place ""culturally responsive-sustaining education (CR-SE)"" at the center. CR-SE embraces students' identities, placing aspects of their race, social class, gender, language, sexual orientation, nationality, religion, or ability at the center of their education. According to DOE, students that learn using CR-SE are more active in class, achieve higher grades, and graduate more often.   School facilities face significant capital and capacity limitations, which can lead to overcrowding, large class sizes, and increased competition between schools for resources. DOE and SCA continue to make important upgrades and advancements to facilities in the district, but more remains to be done. Some Pre-K, daycare and after-school program facilities need repairs, while others lack access to a diversity of spaces for different types of activities. ","Children under 18, make up 20.9% of East Harlem's population. Unfortunately, a disproportionate amount of youth in East Harlem live in poverty, with 45.2% of residents under the age of 18 living below the poverty level (ACS 2021). Children raised in poverty encounter a number of disadvantages that impact their ability to perform well in school, including food and housing insecurity, poor physical and mental health, and reduced concentration and motivation. Our families need resources and services to reinforce the positive development of their children.  Childcare is crucial for both the development of young children and for the economic stability and mobility of working parents, however, access to affordable childcare is out of reach for many of our families. According to the CCC of New York, only 5.6% of East Harlem families with children under 5 spend less than 7% of their annual income on infant and toddler childcare; most East Harlem families spend approximately 33.8% of their annual income on childcare, while the cost of child care is even more burdensome for single parents (71.4% of annual income). If the City's elected leaders intend to promote equity and excellence for all students regardless of family income, race, nationality, disability, or language spoken at home, then they must start with expanding childcare assistance for working parents in need of support.  Finally, services and opportunities for youth must not be limited to youth in school. Approximately 49.2% of East Harlem's youth aged 16 and older are employed, while 12.2% are actively seeking employment (ACS 1-Year, 2014-2019, 2021). The City not only must expand programs like Advance & Earn that target disconnected youth but also dedicate additional resources and time to improve access to education and employment. ","","","","","Crime prevention programs","","Although survey respondents were generally concerned about crime in East Harlem, they indicated support for preventive services -- including youth services, after-school programming, job training, and mental health services. Programming for high-risk youth and their families should be expanded throughout the district and should include late-night and weekend programming. Resources should be funneled toward improving the socioeconomic determinants of crime, particularly educational attainment, unemployment, and poverty. Local organizations that offer these resources should be supported.  The potential for strong collaboration between the police and local groups exists, but more extensive neighborhood-specific training, deeper local partnerships and increased community policing approaches are needed in order to make efforts work properly. Many individuals in East Harlem have a negative view of the police and law enforcement needs to continue to work to rebuild trust within the community.   Finally, the incarceration rate in East Harlem is the third highest in the city and more than double the citywide rate. Incarceration has a devastating effect on the futures of those incarcerated, as well as on families and the larger community. People who have been incarcerated are more likely to experience mental and physical health problems, and may also have trouble finding employment and housing. New York City should expand targeted reentry support for neighborhoods with high incarceration rates.","Public safety is a major concern in CD11. Compared with the citywide rate, East Harlem has a significantly higher rate for non-fatal assault hospitalizations with 130 per 100,000 residents annually-- more than double NYC's and Manhattan's rates (Community Health Profile, 2018). Furthermore, the serious crime rate in East Harlem was 22.3 serious crimes per 1,000 residents in 2022, compared to 14.2 serious crimes per 1,000 residents citywide (a 44.4% difference). Though residents reported the need for increased police presence, the demand for police accountability, transparency, and respect for residents remains paramount while mitigating our crime rate. ","","","","","","Cleanliness/trash collection","","Residents overwhelmingly identified cleanliness and trash collection as their most important issues. Overflowing corner bins, lack of corner bins, canine waste, clogged catch basins, vacant lots, and illegal dumping all contribute to unsanitary conditions and increased rodent activity throughout the district.  DSNY should work to identify problem intersections and introduce rodent-resistant corner bins to each identified problem area in CD11. The agency should increase the frequency of litter basket collection and sanitation enforcement of illegal dumping and canine waste laws.  Additionally, there should be a campaign, led by the DSNY, consisting of community workshops, advertisements, and public service announcements in community-relevant languages to reach the population of East Harlem to educate the community on the importance of keeping the streets clean.","The City's environmental justice law defines ""Environmental Justice Areas"" as low-income or minority communities in New York City. As an identified Environmental Justice Area, East Harlem has been and continues to be more vulnerable to potential environmental injustices and intersectional health equity complications due to factors including a history of systemic racism and inequitable resource distribution.  According to the Community Health Profile 2018, the asthma hospitalization rate in East Harlem is among the highest of all neighborhoods in New York City. The number of adults with asthma is 60 percent higher than the NYC average and the hospitalization rate is 200 percent higher than the NYC average. Among East Harlem's children, the hospitalization rate for asthma attacks is more than two times the city average. Many pollutants within East Harlem, such as the two sanitation garages, proximity to the FDR Drive and other large highways and a lack of green spaces, contribute to high levels of particulate matter in the air.   The Vision Plan for a Resilient East Harlem highlights East Harlem's vulnerability to climate change. The vast majority of CD11 lies in an evacuation zone, with many large public housing complexes located in Zone 1-- the most vulnerable area. Our neighborhood is particularly vulnerable to flooding from extreme rain, sea level rise, and storm surge; managing inland drainage is a critical priority as water is easily trapped in low-lying areas. As such, East Harlem suffered severe flooding during Hurricane Sandy in 2012 and Hurricane Ida in 2021. East Harlem also experiences high average summertime surface temperatures, due to a variety of physical factors including high density and lack of green space.  CD11 needs significant investment in hard and soft infrastructure, including centralized and decentralized stormwater management interventions, living shorelines (oyster beds, marshes, berms), floodgates, as well as community education around climate change and emergency preparedness to prepare residents for future disasters. Bold interventions, although costly, are necessary to combat the dangers of climate change and ensure the livability of our neighborhood for generations to come. Former Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that NYC Parks would receive $284 million to renovate segments of the East River Esplanade in need of repairs. It's crucial that the City continue to invest in and install green infrastructure throughout the esplanade as part of the repairs.  Finally, CB11 would like to see policies such as the Green Infrastructure Grant Program implemented and expanded to close the gap in environmental health disparities achieved through a process that ensures transparency, access, and inclusion for people at every level of the planning and decision-making process. ","Community District 11 currently hosts three Department of Sanitation facilities:   The Manhattan District 11 (M11) garage is ""temporarily"" located on East 127th Street and Second Avenue, adjacent to an elementary school, a heavily utilized public park, and a newly opened cancer treatment facility. It is now our understanding that even with the M11 relocation, DSNY intends to maintain the East 99th Street site as part of its operations, resulting in there being FOUR DSNY facilities in this district.  The Manhattan District 10 (M10) garage which serves Central Harlem is located at 132nd Street and Park Avenue, just five blocks from the new M11 garage. Because of the poor condition of the M10 garage building, most of the sanitation equipment is parked in the street and under the Metro-North railroad viaduct.    The Manhattan Lot Cleaning Unit currently utilizes a surface parking lot on East 123rd Street between Lexington Avenue and Third Avenue. This site was identified in the 2017 East Harlem Rezoning Points of Agreement for the development of affordable housing and its redevelopment is a high priority for our board. However, DSNY has indicated no intention of moving off the site and so its redevelopment remains an open question and a commitment unkept.  To resolve this underserved burden on our community, CB11 proposed funding be allocated for the construction of a new state-of-the-art consolidated facility to house the M11 and M10 garages. This request was incorporated in the 2016 East Harlem Neighborhood Plan and the subsequent 2017 East Harlem Rezoning Points of Agreement (POA) which states that the City would ""working with community stakeholders, plan for the development of an enclosed consolidated DSNY sanitation facility for M10 and M11, which meets LEED gold standards"", further that ""DSNY will immediately begin planning for a permanent, long‐term facility to serve District 11 sanitation needs, which includes the following goals:   	 	explore options for a permanent consolidated facility that could house multiple garages, including: District 11, District 10, District 9, and/or the Manhattan Lot Cleaning Unit; 	 	 	assess suitable sites for the permanent facility that will serve residents for the next 100 years. Explore all City‐owned sites and appropriate privately‐owned sites in Manhattan Community Boards 9, 10, and 11, as well as potential acquisition of the entire Block 1792. 	  ","","","","","Affordable housing creation","","Affordable housing creation  The City must prioritize the completion of East Harlem Rezoning Points of Agreements commitments and develop affordable housing on city-owned sites including the East Harlem Multi-Service Center, the 25th Precinct parking lot at East 119th Street and the lot being utilized by the Department of Sanitation's Lot Cleaning Unit at East 123rd Street. Further the City must act to restart any stalled large scale residential development projects including the remaining commitments for the East 125th Street Development, the proposed Harlem African Burial Ground Memorial Mixed-Use Development, as well as the prioritizing redevelopment of any remaining publicly owned sites in CD11 for affordable housing including any potential leveraging of public sites to facilitate mixed-income developments with private developers.   East Harlem has a high need for affordable housing, both preserved in existing buildings and included in new construction. ","Though large swaths of the district were rezoned as a result of the 2017 East Harlem Neighborhood Rezoning, we encourage the Department of City Planning to reopen and expand the rezoning area, as requested in the East Harlem Neighborhood Plan and consider expanding Mandatory Inclusionary Housing (MIH) to cover First Avenue. Fine-grained zoning changes should be made throughout the community that both facilitate the development of housing affordable to existing community residents, as well as incentivizing nonresidential development.   While MIH will be triggered in any new residential development taking advantage of the increased density, it does not go far enough to address the need for housing that is truly affordable to East Harlem residents. We call upon HPD and HDC to identify and commit additional funding sources to provide both (a) capital subsidies to reduce construction costs and (b) ongoing rental subsidies to both extend the term of affordability for affordable units in mixed-income buildings and to enable deeper levels of affordability, including 10-15% of area median income, while still allowing for a diversity of income. We further ask that the City identify significant additional subsidies to allow for affordable homeownership opportunities and to provide a deeper level of affordability in new development, both on City-owned and privately-owned property.   In June 2019, CB11 adopted a resolution detailing its Affordable Housing Development Guidelines, which should be utilized by City Agencies and developers to design proposals that fit the housing needs of our district. CB11 resolved that development on Publicly Owned Sites should target 100% rent and income-restricted development with deep affordability and at a variety of low- and moderate-income rent levels in perpetuity where units are targeted 20% Extremely Low-Income, 20% Very Low-Income, 20% Low-Income, 20% Moderate-Income, and 20% Middle-Inc]ome. Further, development on Privately Owned Sites seeking a zoning change, should include at least 30% of the residential units affordable at an average of 60% AMI in perpetuity. Thirdly, Condominium or Cooperative Development Developers are encouraged to construct affordable condominiums or cooperatives to provide homeownership opportunities to local residents. Housing proposals that integrate both affordable homeownership and rental units are also encouraged. All condominium or cooperative units should be affordable to low-moderate- and middle-income households earning between 80% and 130% of AMI. ","Affordable housing creation  The City must prioritize the completion of East Harlem Rezoning Points of Agreements commitments and develop affordable housing on city-owned sites including the East Harlem Multi-Service Center, the 25th Precinct parking lot at East 119th Street and the lot being utilized by the Department of Sanitation's Lot Cleaning Unit at East 123rd Street. Further the City must act to restart any stalled large-scale residential development projects including the remaining commitments for the East 125th Street Development, the proposed Harlem African Burial Ground Memorial Mixed-Use Development, as well as the prioritizing redevelopment of any remaining publicly owned sites in CD11 for affordable housing including any potential leveraging of public sites to facilitate mixed-income developments with private developers.   East Harlem has a high need for affordable housing, both preserved in existing buildings and included in new construction.   Affordable Housing Preservation  CD11's housing stock is largely subsidized, rent-stabilized or public housing; only 22% of units are currently unregulated. Data provided by the Furman Center projects that 6,197 subsidized and rent-stabilized units are at risk of eligible expiration over the next 15 years. This, combined with the pressures on regulated housing due to increased development in the area, makes affordable housing programs the top concern in CD11. The East Harlem Neighborhood Plan estimated ""affordable housing need"" in CD11 as 12,000 households. Ours is one of only four districts in Manhattan that saw a net increase in stabilized units in the period of 2007-2020. It did this by gaining over 6,000 new units while losing 4,300 units over the same period. Data suggests that the efforts of CB11 to attract new housing that would be affordable and stabilized have been beneficial to the community in terms of the supply of such units in the aggregate. However, the mounting pressures of rising rents, landlord harassment, and stagnant wages continue to demand the production and preservation of affordable housing in order to forestall wider residential displacement, particularly for low and extremely-low-income households.   As more development comes to East Harlem and rising rents elevate displacement pressures for low-income tenants, it is vital that they are made aware of their rights as tenants and have access to free legal services to protect themselves and their homes from unscrupulous landlords and developers. The City is moving in the right direction by expanding funding for the representation of tenants, but current legal aid funding must be extended. Current residents should be better prepared for affordable housing lotteries. Housing preparedness clinics should be held regularly, and developers should be required to hire a third-party organization to conduct credit counseling and marketing.   Condition of Public Housing  NYCHA operates more than 15,000 apartments across 21 developments in CD11 (accounting for 31.6% of rental units), one of the largest concentrations of public housing in New York City. Public housing accounts for more than one-third of CD11's rental apartments, and remains an affordable housing lifeline for so many. NYCHA has experienced unprecedented disinvestment and deprioritization by federal, state and city agencies for generations. With over $32 billion in capital needs citywide, NYCHA residents suffer from collective neglect and lack of necessary repairs impacting their housing security. Further, the defunding of public housing has manifested short and long-term impacts on the integrity of NYCHA's building stock and the health and safety of their residents. It is critical that the city, along with the state and federal government, prioritize and properly invest the necessary funds in public housing.   ","With many of our residents out of the labor force and receiving various forms of public assistance, we urge all levels of government to refocus their approach from poverty maintenance to poverty alleviation. Workforce development programs must be paid incentives and targeted to our most vulnerable residents. We need government training programs for the structurally unemployed, paying subsidies to firms that provide training to displaced workers, helping them find where jobs exist and continue their education. This effort must include innovation, such as skills enhancement, digital skills, and working networks, as well as focusing on alternative methods of alleviation- a focus on small business creation, entrepreneurship, job-readiness, and low-cost and free childcare to support single-parent households.  As we continue to move away from policies that have contributed to mass incarceration, support is urgently needed to expand programs that meaningfully assist individuals with a history of involvement with the criminal justice system to successfully reintegrate into the workforce. Similarly, policies must be set and enforced to counteract hiring practices that are prejudiced against the formerly incarcerated. Paired with social services that aid this population, the opportunity to find meaningful and dependable means of income is vital to successful re-entry and reducing recidivism. These are our family members and neighbors; it is incumbent upon our community, service providers, and our government to aid them to the extent possible in their successful reintegration.  Some of the greatest challenges that formerly incarcerated individuals face when returning back into the workforce are: experience, low levels of education or vocational skills, and many health-related issues, ranging from mental health needs to substance abuse histories. When these challenges remain, it affects our neighborhoods and families which in turn, feeds a cycle of crime and poverty.  Local hiring boosts the local economy by creating jobs and providing hands-on training/experience opportunities that wouldn't otherwise be available would strengthen our community. This can be accomplished by providing funding for a local workforce development provider that identifies, screens, and refers local residents to appropriate employers. Labor unions should also build pre-apprenticeship programs and work to ensure apprentices are moving up through the system to earn a living wage.  Overall, economic activity must be increased to bring more businesses, commercial activity, and employment opportunities to our key commercial corridors. Financial literacy/education should be offered for free to residents, especially in NYCHA developments to promote entrepreneurial engagement. SBS must focus aid on marketing and specifically branding local merchant organizations and providers of business support services.  CD11 is anticipating a significant business interruption upon commencement of construction for the Second Phase of the Second Avenue Subway. It is necessary for the MTA and the City to mitigate the disruption that this project will bring to small businesses along the project corridor. SBS and EDC should be working proactively with business and property owners in anticipation of work commencing on this massive infrastructure project. ","","","","","Subway service and quality (frequency, access, crowding, etc.)","","CD11 residents report frequent delays in subway service at the Lexington Avenue line stations in the district. There is also a concern that these stations are not adequately patrolled by the police, particularly off hours when safety concerns are highest. Overcrowding is a persistent frustration for CD11 residents seeking to board at 125th Street. As congestion pricing is rolled out, an anticipated concern is that overcrowding will only increase and our residents will be even more inconvenienced. The MTA must make improvements to its subways schedule to better meet the needs of residents in districts such as this one that are caught between high demand to our north and the central business district to our south. The MTA must consider expansion and re-routing of buses routes in order to mitigate the unintended yet still serious negative impacts resulting from the implementation of congestion pricing.   Traffic Safety & Enforcement (cars, scooters, e-bikes)  Current levels of traffic safety and enforcement appear to work towards meeting the needs of our district. Using aggregated and normalized data from the NYC Open Data Portal - NYPD Motor Vehicle Collisions, and John Krauss's NYPD Crash Data Bandaid, there have been 662 total crashes within this district between July 2022 and July 2023 (a 5.9% decrease from July 2021 - July 2022; and 1.6% of total NYC crashes between July 2022 and July 2023); including 2 fatalities, and 853 injuries. The fatalities consisted only of pedestrians; while of the injuries, 125 were cyclists, 184 were pedestrians, and 580 were motorists.   Contributing factors in these crashes -- including driver inattention/distraction, improper passing or lane usage, unsafe speed, and failure to yield right-of-way -- arguably, are preventable through sensible traffic mitigation measures. Funds are needed to install measures throughout this district with the goal of totaling no more than 1% of total crashes throughout NYC within a given fiscal quarter.","Overall, street design improvements are needed to reduce sidewalk congestion and improve pedestrian and bicyclist safety. These design improvements are particularly vital so seniors and visually impaired residents can use the streets safely. Uneven curb cuts and cracks in sidewalks raise concerns of accessibility and pose risks to our residents with disabilities and/or mobility impairment.   In 2016, the East Harlem Neighborhood Health Action Center surveyed more than 200 residents in what culminated in the Block by Block: Walking for a Healthier East Harlem report. Of those surveyed, 57% rated the street lighting as fair, poor, or very poor. Insufficient and obstructed lighting contributes to residents' concerns about safety in the neighborhood.  Congruent to constituent sentiment, Beta.NYC Boardstat reports that residents from this district submitted a total of 1,065 requests to 311 regarding insufficient street light conditions throughout 2022 - ranking number 8 in this district's top 10 complaint types of the year; and ranking number 1 in the most numbers of this complaint type between the Manhattan community districts, accounting for 15.6% of total street light condition complaints throughout the borough in the same year. There is a clear disparity in perceived lighting conditions as all other community districts have less than 1,000 complaints in the same report. Though we acknowledge that the East 125th Street Plaza underneath the Metro-North station has significantly improved lighting, activation, and pedestrian safety - this district (particularly East Harlem North) needs the necessary funding to repair or install additional resilient light fixtures in prominent ""dark spots"", including bulbs with brighter lumens that will not pose a significant impact on energy consumption.   Several bridges and heavily traveled commuter corridors are adjacent to or pass through East Harlem, including the Triboro/RFK Bridge, Willis Avenue Bridge, Third Avenue Bridge, Madison Avenue Bridge, the Harlem River Drive/FDR Drive, and several popular avenues and cross streets. Heavy vehicular traffic has a negative impact on pedestrian safety at several key intersections and causes issues of reliability of NYC Transit bus lines. The Department of Transportation (DOT) should consider making traffic and safety improvements along Fifth Avenue between East 96th - and 102nd Streets; and on East 116th and 117th Streets by the East River Plaza. DOT should also consider extending the designated bus route on Fifth Avenue North to East 110th Street.  This board will continue to advocate for further efficient traffic flow and effective enforcement, to curb delinquent on-road behavior such as those perpetuated by all-terrain vehicles (ATVs) and motorbike users; including illegal scooters and cycle use on sidewalks. DOT, in partnership with NYPD Traffic Enforcement, must consider expanding punitive measures for placard abuse and errant parking behavior in pedestrian crossings, bike lanes, traffic-restricted areas, and throughout the Park Avenue Viaduct tunnels. ","Phase 2 of the Second Avenue Subway project must commence, as East Harlem is currently only serviced by the severely overcrowded Lexington Avenue lines. Subway stations in East Harlem need to be fully accessible for those with disabilities and/or mobility impairments. Although the Lexington Avenue line station at 125th Street has an elevator, residents report that it often does not function correctly and needs repairs. The 110th Street station recently received accessibility upgrades, the same is needed at the 116th Street station. All stations in our district are in desperate need of more frequent cleaning.  Many of our residents rely on bus service to travel to, from, and throughout the district; unfortunately, they experience significant delays with unreliable service due to traffic and the lack of enforcement of bus lanes. The MTA and DOT should work alongside CB11 to identify solutions to persistent delays in bus routes in East Harlem, particularly on Third Avenue, Lexington Avenue and Madison Avenue. NYC Transit should consider improving the M1 bus line performance by changing the route to originate north of the Queensboro Bridge, so that commuters in East Harlem are not impacted by the congestion downtown. Congestion pricing will inevitably result in direct impacts to bordering communities like East Harlem in terms of increased demand for alternative parking for those seeking to avoid tolls as well as increased demand for public transportation accessed in bordering communities. It is imperative that the MTA and DOT ensure that mitigations are in place that address the deleterious impacts on communities such as ours while seeking to alleviate congestion in other communities. ","","","","Done!","Access to and quality of cultural programming","","East Harlem has a proud and rich cultural history and vibrant artistic community. CD11 is home to important cultural institutions including the Museum of the City of New York, El Museo del Barrio, the National Black Theatre, the Julia de Burgos Cultural Center, the Caribbean Cultural Center African Diaspora Institute, the Africa Center, the Graffiti Wall of Fame, PS 109 Artspace, and, of course, La Marqueta.  Operational funding is needed to support these important resources and encourage future growth, preservation and exploration of the arts and culture programming in CD11. Capital funding is also needed to provide the maintenance, upkeep, and revitalization of these institutions. NYC & Company should work with local artists and theater operators to promote East Harlem as a location for “Off-Broadway” theater productions spotlighting both local artists and other aspiring artists. This would be one step towards boosting tourism and bringing much-needed capital into East Harlem.  Funding must be provided for arts/cultural service organizations to enhance, educate, and expand public interest in the arts and culture of East Harlem. A campaign to bring these entities and artists to East Harlem will solidify our community commitment to the important place our culture has in New York City and re-establish our commitment to the arts. Once established, and representative of a cross-section of the East Harlem community, these organizations should work to develop a comprehensive art and cultural strategic master plan for CD11. ","East Harlem's parks serve a critical role in the health, well-being, and quality of life of our residents, however many of our parks need better maintenance, staffing, and capital upgrades. Residents report excess garbage, cracked pavement, and outdated facilities in parks. 311 data shows that the parks/greenspaces in CD11 have received 443 complaints regarding maintenance and facility conditions in 2022 (a 51.7% increase from 2021; 11% of 2022 citywide total).  DCP's Capital Planning Explorer tool highlights a considerable number of our parks, gardens, and historical sites located in flood hazard zones; due to the risks and our history of extreme flood events, improvements to parks should be required to include climate protection and resiliency features as well as additional greenery and landscaping to assist with the retention and slow release of water.   Harlem River Park, Each One Teach One, Lincoln Playground, and Marcus Garvey Park, in particular, would benefit from greater sanitation services to address their rodent and trash problems.   Safety in East Harlem's parks is also a primary concern. A few of the parks in East Harlem --  including Ronald McNair Park, Harlem River Park, and Marcus Garvey Park -- have been identified as hot spots for homelessness, substance misuse, and illicit activity.  According to the Vision Plan for a Resilient East Harlem, the average surface temperature in East Harlem in August is over two degrees higher than that of NYC overall. Key contributing factors include East Harlem's lower-than-average vegetation cover, as compared to NYC overall. Parks and trees are one of the most effective ways to combat extreme heat. Excess heat not only causes illnesses and higher risks to children and the elderly but also contributes to increases in violence.  On a basic level, the amount of open space in East Harlem is insufficient. While New York City has a standard of 1.5 acres of open space per 1,000 residents, New Yorkers for Parks has set a higher goal of 2.5 and has found that there are 2.9 acres of open space per 1,000 residents city-wide. Without Randall's Island or Central Park, East Harlem falls well below this benchmark with only 0.77 acres of open space per 1,000 residents (East Harlem Neighborhood Plan). With so much of the open space located at the neighborhood's edges, it is critical to address the physical barriers to using these parks. In the case of Randall's Island, Harlem River Park, and the waterfront esplanade, there is a need to create better access to recreational spaces, in addition to ensuring that additional green spaces are created wherever possible.  Many of our parks don't have public restrooms. CB11 is advocating for the inclusion of a public restroom at the upcoming greenway link between 125th and 132nd Streets. The board also maintains the position that the park, upon its completion, should be named Richard Toussaint Park to celebrate our former board member's advocacy for this project.  Finally, our parks perform a vital function in building social cohesion and resilience. NYC Parks should increase public programming to meet the specific needs of youth in our district, with a focus on working with the community and CB11 to help guide and conceive of projects at all scales. ","","East Harlem is home to two branches of the New York Public Library (NYPL), the 125th Street Library and the Aguilar Library. Two other branches are located across from our district boundary lines and regularly used by residents of CD11, the East 96th Street Library and the Harlem Library located on East 124th Street. Our libraries are heavily used by the local community and are an especially valuable resource to our low-income residents. In addition to supporting literacy, libraries are community hubs that offer job skills training, computer and language classes, cultural competency, art appreciation, and community building.  Both the 125th Street Library and Aguilar Library are currently closed for much-needed capital improvements and modernization. While these libraries are closed it is vital that NYPL offer extended hours and services at the neighboring branches and also provide satellite library services throughout our district. NYPL should pursue partnerships with local educational and cultural institutions and community-based organizations to house temporary floating collections and offer library programming, skills training, and other classes.  Funding must be increased so that NYPL branches can remain open until at least 8 p.m. on weekdays, offer full-day service on weekends, and continue to expand its collections, programming, and staffing. ","The operating budget for community boards should be increased to reflect the vital role they play in planning and quality of-life advocacy for neighborhoods all across the city. Increased funding would allow boards to hire additional professional staff to support the board's engagement of the community planning and development, municipal budgeting and legislative processes impacting their districts and the city at large. There has not been any significant increase to community board budgets despite labor costs increasing and inflation.    With the return to in-person meetings, post-COVID-19 State of Emergency, community boards now conduct their meetings in a hybrid format which allows the public to continue to attend and participate via video conference as they have since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting shutdown. However, our budgets have not been adjusted to reflect this new reality and status quo for public bodies in New York State. Funding is essential for community board's ability to meet the promise of continued remote accessibility for the public and offset the costs for videography services and utilization of suitable offsite meeting spaces.

The boundaries of the district are the Harlem River; East 149th Street; Park Avenue; East 159th Street; East 161st Street; Prospect Avenue; East 149th Street and the East River. The neighborhoods served are Port Morris, Mott Haven and Melrose. The district has a 2020 population of 100,929, up from 2010 population of 91,497 and 82,159 in 2000. Land Use patterns are of single family and two family residential properties, institutional, mixed residential, commercial, office, and industrial uses. The general trend of the district is one of future population growth with mixed income residents. ","","","","","Affordable Housing","","As the number of city owned sites in the district is minimal it is critical that the need for affordability in the city pipeline of publicly owned sites not be reduced.  In the development of these sites a balance of  housing needed in the district must be maintained.  The current new construction by private developers in the Mott Haven area during the past five years are trending toward utilizing the Extremely Low and Low Income Affordability program. The advancing of this housing is seen as a return to early models of development when the district had a larger portion of vacant city titled land and housing stock.  Currently, a wider range of housing covering all income classes must be pursued.  We ask that new housing development under the Multifamily mix and match program and the Multifamily Rental Mixed Income program be advanced by the department in fiscal year 2022.  We further ask that funding be made available to fund the preservation of existing housing stock such as the 20 NYCHA developments and other large privately owned government assisted housing complexes in the district. The relocation of residents into the district seeking privately market rate housing south of Bruckner Boulevard along the Harlem River and in Port Morris has created and imbalance with the housing needs and affordability of residents seeking housing in the Melrose and Port Morris areas of the district.  We are extremely concerned with the developments of new shelters, supportive housing and the jail in the district that is already overburdened with these uses, particularly in the Concord Avenue portion of the district.  The majority of land use trends and actions over the past five years have been in the area of zoning map amendments for the development of new housing.  There is a need for affordable housing for seniors that include programs to service this population.","Crime and Public Safety","","There has been an uptick in robberies, shootings, gang violence and drug distribution throughout the district that includes robberies in the business and commercial areas throughout the district.","Quality of life issues (noise, graffiti, petty crime, etc.)","","Since 2018 as a result of criminal justice bail reform coupled with the COVID-19 pandemic, crime has risen significantly in the district.  We are asking the City to implement a proper policing plan for the district to address crime, drug distribution and guns.  We are asking for funding for system partnerships to develop collaborative relationships with local juvenile system stakeholders to divest youth from advancing into the juvenile justice system.  We ask for funding for youth development, family strengthening and building community capacity for neighborhood organizations to serve youth in the community.  There is a need for increased funding for juvenile justice and services for at-risk youth due to the high incidents of youth violence involving guns.  There is a need to improve oversight with parolees by the Department of Probation to ensure that parolees are properly supervised. We ask the City of New York to increase Police Officers in the district to address the rise in crime and address the quality of life issues.     ","","","","","Chronic disease prevention and management (diabetes, heart disease, etc.)","","Add funding for Asthma treatment.

It is comprised of the neighborhoods of Hunt's Point, Longwood and the southeastern portion of Morrisiania. The Europeans first settled Hunt's Point in 1663. At this time, Edward Jessup and John Richardson arrived on the peninsula and purchased the land from the Wekkguasegeeck tribe indigenous to the area. After Jessup died, his widow, Elizabeth entrusted the land to Thomas Hunt Jr., her son in-law. Once part of West Farms in lower Westchester County, the area was annexed to New York City in 1874 and began to develop after a subway line from Manhattan was extended in 1904. As more people moved to the area, the city's business owners began to realize the advantages of locating to Hunt's Point. Among them were the convenient access to the Tri-State region, the existing rail lines running through the Hunt's Point area and the abundance of space available for the development of industrial and commercial activity. Today, Hunt's Point is consider one of the largest transportation hubs in the City with vehicle, rail and barge. By the 1960's local housing was deteriorating and many residents left for the suburbs. Hunt's Point was beset by poverty, drugs, and crime in the 1970's and early 1980's. Characterized by frequent arson and mass abandonment, this period was undoubtedly the low point in the area's rich and diverse history. Living conditions became so difficult that almost 60,000 residents, approximately two-thirds of the existing population left, or were forced out, of the neighborhood during the 1970's. Conditions later vastly improved through the initiatives of SEBCO Development Corp., Banana Kelly Community Improvement Association, South Bronx Development Corp., the Bronx Borough President's Office, and the New York City Department of Housing Preservation & Development which created new housing and rehabilitated existing housing. The success of their efforts are clearly evident. Between 1980 and 1990, the population of the district grew by 14.7 percent, the largest margin of growth of any community in the Bronx. From 1990 to 2000 the Growth rate was 18.7 percent, From 2000 to 2010 the growth rate was 12%. Of over 6000 new units, two-thirds are located in what were once vacated buildings and one-third are newly created low-density housing. So thorough is the development and renovation of the district that no city owned apartment building in the community stands vacant.

The boundaries for Bronx Community District Three are north by the Cross Bronx Expressway and Crotona Park North; east by the Sheridan Expressway, E. 169 St., E. 167 St. and Prospect Avenue; south by E. 159 St. and E. 161 St. and west by Park and Webster Avenues. Due to varying socio-economic factors during the period 1970-1980, Community District 3 experienced the most significant population decline compared to all districts within the borough (64%). Between 2000 and 2010, the district led the borough in new population growth (16.3% change), exceeding the 4.8% cumulative increase in population for Bronx County as a whole, during this period. Overall, the district has experienced a 50% increase in its population from 1980, largely due to an unprecedented increase of 8,457 units of new residential housing, and the preservation of an additional 9,036 units, since FY'1990.  The total increased population in 2010 was 28,182 and in 2020 increased by another 6,178 totaling 93,755.   In accordance with Bronx Community District 3's Neighborhood Development Plan-Partnership For the Future, adopted by the NYC Council in November of 1992 as New York City's first community-based planning initiative submitted in accordance with Sect. 197a of the NYC Charter, the NYC Department of City Planning has determined that the goals of Community District 3 to ""increase the district population as well as provide for mixed-income housing"", have been met substantially. Recent district and borough profile reports published by the NYC Department of City Planning for 2015, also indicate that while Bronx County experienced a decline in death rates per 1,000 persons of 0.7% for the period 2005-2012, the rate of decline within Community District 3 was more significant at 1.1%. Similarly, while Bronx County, as a whole, experienced a decline in the rate of infant mortality for the period 2005-2012 of .6%, the rate of decline in Community District 3 was significantly higher at 3.9%. The percent of the decline in birth rates for Community District Three vis-à-vis Bronx County as a whole for the period 2005-2012, was comparable at 1.2% per 1,000 persons. Based on 2010 U.S. census demographics, Community District 3 is comprised primarily of individuals of Hispanic origin (2020- 52,646), followed by Black/African Americans (2020 - 36, 599). For the period 2000-2010, the percentage of individuals over 18 years of age totaled 25% compared to 0.3% for those under 18 years of age. General Areas of Concern: With the growth in population over the years attributable to increased new housing unit production and US immigrant migration patterns, the district continues to be faced with challenges in the areas of unemployment, insufficient job development/training programs, insufficient youth, and after-school program services, inadequate educational attainment for youth/young adults, insufficient English Learning Language (ELL) programs for new immigrant groups, insufficient education services related to public health disparities and nutrition and the ever-increasing demands placed on its communities by the city administration, related to disproportionate siting of temporary homeless and special needs housing. NYS Dept. of Labor unemployment rate for Bronx county - 7.0% (June 2015); NYS average- 5.3% NYC DOE (2013-2014) School Quality Report results for CD 3 (primarily School Districts 9 and 12) show below average ratings in attendance and achievement on NYS standardized tests. NYCDOHMH Community Health profiles and vital statistics summaries show CD 3 has the highest age-adjusted death rate of 8.7 % per 1,000 persons (2013). Bronx Community District Three contains approximately 5% (2,717) of NYC's total homeless population based on the September 2014 estimate of 56,000 persons; approximately 18 facility sites. This figure represents three times (3X) what the average estimate, per district, would be (1.7%), should NYC Fair Share siting requirements have been strictly implemented. This land-use and facility planning decision by the NYC DHS, independent of and in consideration of the provision of ample supportive services for the populations in question, is singularly the largest factor that would undermine balanced planning and quality-of-life achievements made throughout the years, in the district. ","","","","","Affordable Housing","","Based on the Community District Needs Survey, Bronx Community Board Three is challenged with providing affordable housing to its residents. According to the US Department of Housing and Urban Development ((HUD) The 2022 Area Median Income (AMI) for NYC IS $120,100 for a three-person family (100% AMI).  One in three (30.2%) Bronx residents live below the poverty level—less than $18,310 per year for a family of three —and over one in seven (13.4%) experienced severe poverty (earning less than 50% of the federal poverty level), both of which are twice the state and national rates.  Workforce Development Centers need funding to provide meaningful career pathways for all. New Yorkers continue to struggle to find work and opportunities due to the economic disruption of the pandemic.  Workforce Development Centers can develop training programs that prepare workers with skills for dynamic career pathways in high-growth sectors.    Afterschool programs are needed to break educational barriers for our youth.  Tutoring services for our youth are needed to overcome overcrowded classrooms, and educational barriers,  wherein they graduate from high school and are ready for a college degree or a postsecondary credential to begin their career.   The purpose of this initiative is to ensure that housing can be affordable if stakeholders become educated and attend college or receive post-secondary credentials to be income eligible for housing.       ","Crime and Public Safety","","Based on the results from the Community District Needs Survey, Crime and Public Safety are major concerns.  The  42nd Police Precinct Compstat reports for the seven major crimes within Community District Three since 2021 are as follows:  Murder has gone down by (-70.6%), Rape has increased by 8,8%, Robberies have increased by 28.3%, Fel. Assault has increased by 4.9%, Burglaries have increased by 58.0%, Gr. Larceny has increased by 7.3%, and Grand Larceny Assaults have increased by 31.3.   Relationships between residents and law enforcement, who are the front-line representatives of the criminal justice system, remain strained—and in many cases, nonexistent. Distrust in law enforcement often goes hand in hand with distrust in local government as a whole, likely because police are one of the most visible representatives of government within the community.  Crime statistics show that in low-income neighborhoods, where the rise of over-policing coincides with a lack of government investment in job opportunities, high-quality schools, and essential health and social services exist a higher crime rate.  Communities of color are safer when residents can access stable jobs, high-quality schools and social services, and clean and vibrant public spaces. To break the cycle of disinvestment and distrust, city officials must adopt engagement strategies that are inclusive of communities that have historically been left out of government decision-making processes. One such effort is NeighborhoodStat, an initiative launched by the city of New York to empower residents of high-crime communities to help shape the city’s public safety agenda within their neighborhoods and build partnerships with city agencies and community organizations.  NeighborhoodStat empowers residents to set their own agenda for addressing the issues affecting the safety of their neighborhoods and puts in place a structure allowing them to partner with city leaders to bring their vision into reality. Importantly, NeighborhoodStat relies on active participation and buy-in from members of the community, establishing the legitimacy of the city’s efforts to strengthen public safety.","Youth and children's services","","Bronx CB3 is also challenged to provide sufficient after school tutorial, recreational and family support programs for students in primary and secondary school. Increased funding is needed for after school, support, and tutorial assistance for students, as well as resources for parents, to assist them in promoting the educational achievement of their children in school districts 8,9 and 12, in Bronx Community District Three.   Improving existing libraries and updating HVAC systems and other technologies so that children and youth have a safe and enjoyable environment.  The purpose of this initiative is to ensure that all children are healthy, and ready to succeed academically; wherein they graduate from high school and are ready for college degree or a post-secondary credential to begin their career.

","It is clear from the 2013 NYC DOHMH Summary of Vital Statistics Report, that Bronx CD 3 is faced with the need to become a more health conscious community, individually, through education and improved choices related to nutrition and healthy eating options; as well as environmentally by reducing human behavioral factors which contribute to area dumpout conditions, unsanitary street and sidewalk cleanliness conditions and the proliferation of vermin within our neighborhoods.     The NYC DOHMH, Bureau of Pest Control Services, must increase its community education and awareness campaigns and outreach efforts, in collaboration with the local community board, the NYC Dept. of Consumer Affairs, the NYC Dept. of Education, the  NYC Dept. of Sanitation, local community based organizations, tenant and homeowners associations and merchant groups and associations, in these areas.","According to information provided by DFTA (CENSUS 2010), the elderly population (60 yrs.+) represents 17.2% of NYC's population. The decade 2000-2010, had shown an uptick of 12.4% in the elderly population after a decline since 1980. Approximately 30% of persons 60 and over are between the ages 60 and 64; one in three are 75 and over and one in ten are 85 and over. In contrast to the 12.4% increase in the elderly population since 1980, the total population of NYC grew by 2.1% only. The population under 60, was almost unchanged due to a decline in the number of young persons age 14 and under, during the past decade. It is clear that CENSUS 2010 demographics in this area, support the need of the city administration to increase funding to address the needs of the city's growing elderly population.    DFTA records show that Bronx CD 3 is home to 4 senior centers but serviced by 11 in areas related to arts, congregate lunch, health mgmt., telephone assurance, physical health/exercise, case assistance and case assistance medicaid, education/recreation, information, nutrition education, transportation, home delivered alternative meals, technology, visiting, etc..     Bronx CB 3 advocates for continued citywide budgetary increases in all programs, particularly the meals on wheels program, evidenced by the city administration's efforts to increase the agency's budget in FY' 17 by 5% ($1.8m) in this area. Bronx CB 3 also advocates for increased funding for transportation/escort services, case management, nutrition education, physical health/exercise, geriatric mental health and technology training, in an effort to support the nutritional, physical, emotional and technological needs of its growing senior population.","Citywide, Bronx Community District Three is at the forefront as a district, in its representation of the social consciousness and sensitivity, born by local governance, in meeting the ever growing needs and demands of the city's homeless population.  Needless to say, the city administration, through its NYC Dept. of Homeless Services, must re-evaluate the application of the NYC Fair Share Siting criteria, in determining the basis for future facility sitings in Bronx Community District Three.","Bronx Community Board Three supports increased funding for the following program services for low income and vulnerable residents within Bronx Community District Three:    Increased job training/development and educational programs for adults with enhanced job search and placement support. These program services should assist young adults out of school, as well, in obtaining certifications in skilled trades or occupations with future local and regional employment growth opportunities.

Eden, Highbridge, West Concourse, East Concourse, and Concourse Village. Our district is bounded by the Cross Bronx Expressway to the North, East 149th Street to the South, Webster to Park Avenue on the East and the Harlem River on the West. Nearly 160,000 residents call Community District Four home. We celebrate their distinct cultures and points of view. Our district is a great place to visit, work and live. We are the host to the world-renowned Yankee Stadium, Bronx Terminal Market/Gateway Center, the Borough's Court System, the Bronx Museum of the Arts, the future home of the Bronx Children's Museum and the Universal Hip Hop Museum.  An astounding array of architecture styles are on full display including revivalist styles such as Tudor, Renaissance, and Colonial Revival, and Art Deco buildings within the Grand Concourse Historic District. We continue to attract public and private investment leveraging our locational advantages; we are 20 minutes from midtown Manhattan, have excellent transit access including multiple subway lines, regional access with the Metro North and Major Deegan Expressway, and an extraordinary network of open space and recreational facilities. Bronx Point, which will be located along 149th Street and the Harlem River, will include new amenities at Mill Pond Park, 1,000 units of affordable housing and the future home of the Universal Hip Hop Museum. The Jerome Avenue Neighborhood Plan approved by City Council in March 2018 resulted in $189 million invested for the creation and preservation of affordable housing, design and construction of new open space and a new state-of-the art middle school. Advocacy to support the additional density resulted in the MTA allocating capital funds for the installation of an elevator at 170th Street station on the #4 train which was completed in 2023. Several other capital investments are well underway including the construction of nearly 1,000 units of affordable housing (including 69 senior units) and designs of Corporal Irwin Fischer Park, Goble Playground and Grant Park. While these additions are welcome, we continue to face numerous challenges.  While New York City's jobless rate is 5.6% and unemployment nationally is 3.8 % and 4.4% in New York State respectively, unemployment in the Bronx is 7.3%, which means that unemployment in Community District Four is nearly double that. In a District where people continue to struggle on a day-to-day basis, we need to invest and allocate more resources to job training/development and job creation to provide a robust employment network for area residents.  This includes continuing to investment in our young people through the Summer Youth Employment Program (SYEP) and other mechanisms to better prepare them for a variety of career paths. New York City has seen  thousands of small businesses shutter their doors over the last two years, 30% of those being restaurants. As many of these small businesses support families these losses affect not just the local economy but the day-to-day lives of local residents.  We are now facing a crisis of epic proportions with the arrival of more than 1,000 migrants a day straining resources across NY.  Quality of life issues including noise, loitering, public safety (in particular shooting incidents) and sanitation are major concerns for area residents.  Enforcement of traffic laws and a concerted effort to deter loitering and loud music must continue to be a priority for the City. The construction of the 153rd Street Bridge would not only provide relief for traffic congestion; it would create significant economic development opportunities including good paying jobs for local residents and transform the landscape of the South Bronx.  The City must continue to seek innovative solutions that will support our long-term growth and sustainability.  ","","","","","Affordable Housing","","Nearly eighty percent of the housing stock in the district is rent-stabilized.  The preservation of our current housing stock is on the critical path for area residents.  In addition to the lack of affordable housing for current residents we must now grapple with the many thousands of migrants that are now being sheltered in NYC.  Current estimates suggest that there are 65,000 migrants in the NYC shelter system.  The number of homeless shelters that have opened in our District is disproportionate when compared to others when what we need is permanent affordable housing.        Currently, HPD estimates more than 3,600 affordable housing units based on developer interest in their pipeline (According to latest estimates, May 2021).  We implore the City to implement Area Median Income (AMI) Income Averaging to ensure that any new affordable housing constructed in the district encompasses a wider range and mix of incomes as opposed to strict income ranges that do no support economic diversity within new housing stock.     In addition, the 10452 zip code had 5,263 eviction filings between 2018-2022, fourth highest in the city. These facts combined with a 31% increase in the homeless population over the last year and the influx of migrants makes the facilitation and production of affordable housing a top priority. ","Quality of life issues (noise, graffiti, petty crime, etc.)","","The ongoing issue of noise complaints-- (particularly in the summer months--) is a result of large groups of people congregating and hanging out on residential blocks thereby impeding residents’ ability to coexist peacefully and enjoy the sanctity of their homes. The severe increase of on-street activity, parties, loud music and noise has time and time again tried the patience of local residents.  The two categories leading all 311 complaints filed continues to be Noise on the Street/Sidewalk and Noise Residential.  However, it has been reported by several residents that complaints are not being properly addressed and many are simply closed with no visible evidence that anyone has attempted to address the issue.   Also, the increased number of unlicensed and uninsured motorized vehicles (scooters, e-bikes, mopeds) being operated that do not obey traffic laws and endanger pedestrians have become a serious safety concern that must be addressed as well as the issue with the flammable lithium-ion batteries that power some of them.  Residents and businesses continue to suffer making some parts of the district unbearable for many who have either relocated or are in the process of relocating.  If a concerted effort is not made to make serious inroads as it relates to Quality of Life issues the mass exodus from the district and the city will continue.   ","Trash removal and cleanliness","","We continue to experience trash piles and chronic dumping in discrete locations throughout the district.  The streets and sidewalks do not resemble what they did pre-pandemic. We consistently see overflowing trash cans, big bellies and household items left on street corners.  DSNY budgets have been restored to pre-pandemic levels but they need more support in terms of staffing and from sister agencies.  Additional JTP workers would be a tremendous asset in helping the department maintain the District's Step Streets.  Double parking and leaving vehicles parked during alternate side cleaning days is an on-going issue.  Traffic summonses and tickets might help curb this behavior which precludes DSNY from adequately cleaning streets, collecting trash and keeping our district clean.  ","","","","","Chronic disease prevention and management (diabetes, heart disease, etc.)","","The prevalence of obesity which can lead to diabetes and hypertension factor prominently in the health profile of many local residents.  Poverty also plays a key role, as thirty-two percent of area residents live in poverty as compared to twenty-percent of NYC residents.  According to the 2018 Community Health Profile, the adult obesity rate is 34% higher than the rest of NYC.  Obesity can lead to high-blood pressure, diabetes and other chronic diseases.  Seventeen percent of residents have been diagnosed with diabetes and 42% of adults have been diagnosed with hypertension.  These and other factors contribute to the high prevalence of chronic diseases that are not well managed in the district.    We advocate for community-based education, programming and services focused on health and wellness with a focus on access to healthy food and active living.  COVID-19 has underscored the dire need for area residents to seek and obtain preventive care and improve their overall health profile.  DOHMH in collaboration with CDOT and DPR and a strong network of community-based organizations can effectively work to improve the District's health profile.  While we are asked to identify the ""Most Important Issue"" related to Health Care and Human Services in these unprecedented times we cannot ignore the needs related to food access and healthy foods, mental health, services for seniors, victims of domestic violence and other vulnerable populations.  Our overall health and wellness are the keys to success in all areas of life.","Lack of health care facilities and services available to area residents has taken center stage during the pandemic.  High percentages of residents with pre-existing conditions and the high positivity rates and deaths related to COVID-19 make the siting of new health care facilities extremely important.  This is particularly important in Highbridge where residents are isolated with limited access to services and programming.  ","As seniors age in place in the district we must ensure that they are given consideration in all facets of everyday living including transportation, affordable housing and health and wellness.   We need to advocate for more funding and the creation of more affordable senior housing so that those who have worked and contributed to the district are able to benefit from its transformation.  We also need to ensure that we are actively engaged in programs and services that address the heath and wellness of our senior population.  ","Community District Four remains in the top ten districts city-wide in terms of the number of homeless facilities and homeless people it shelters. Homelessness is a serious issue in New York City and we have done our part in working with organizations that provide supportive housing in our community and taking on more than our fair share of these types of facilities.  The City must take a hard look at the ""Fair Share"" criteria and reevaulaute its efficacy in terms of the equitable distribution of facilities across NYC. During the pandemic, DHS announced they would be utilizing a hotel in the district to isolate some of the city's most vulnerable residents.  This site is now being used for migrant families.  We will continue to reiterate our position that we are uninterested in the siting of any new facilities in our district or increasing the number of homeless families and individuals we house.  Street homelessness has steadily been on the rise.  HOMESTAT should be continued and expanded to provide the type of wrap around services needed by this extremely vulnerable population. We hope that the City will reassess policies related to homelessness in the wake of the complicated affordable housing landscape here in NYC.  In addition, we hope that DHS will continue to partner with HPD and other relevant agencies on out-of-the box solutions to solve for the ever-evolving homeless crisis.  ","Housing and food access have become extremely scarce for area residents during the pandemic.  Lack of employment opportunities, high unemployment and the high cost of food paints a stark picture for the district. The City should focus on a public service campaign encouraging students and their families to shop healthy (vegetables, fruit,etc). There also needs to be a concerted interagency effort to support job training, development and placement.  SBS, DHS,HRA, EDC and HPD should be working together to create a job pipeline for area residents. ","","","","","Other - Write In (Required)","","There are a growing number of needs that are necessary for the growth and development of our young people.  It is extremely difficult to choose one and in our opinion several are interrelated: Afterschool programs, youth employment and job training, remote technology and learning and support services for special needs youth. ","The last three years have changed the education landscape significantly.   Although school is back in-person we should leverage the valuable lessons the pandemic taught us. We implore NYC DOE to truly invest in remote learning and technology to ensure that our children receive the quality education they deserve and lay a solid foundation for their future. COVID-19 underscored the importance of the upkeep and maintenance of our educational facilities. We have numerous facilities in the district requiring repairs and upgrades.  NYC DOE must invest in the resources for students and teachers to effectively execute distance/remote learning when necessary.  DOE must ensure that students and teaches are adequately versed in technology. Students in CSD's 7 and 9 face several challenges from poverty to unemployment to overcoming a language barrier as an immigrant. If you know better, you do better. We know our kids deserve better and it is incumbent upon us to do better for them. Every student is entitled to a quality education. We should be preparing our young people for the future and that means helping them obtain skills in technology.  DOE needs to reevaluate its curriculum and policies as it relates to remote learning and technology.  We need to create more pathways to employment for our young people. The reintegration of trade schools and trades into the curriculum will create more opportunities for all.   ","Nearly thirty percent of Community District Four's residents are under the age of 18, and many of these residents are immigrants or children of immigrants who live below the poverty threshold.  With an Area Median Income of $29,000, the City must make every effort to support our district's low-income families in every way, via a wide variety of services and programs relating to children and child welfare. The City should also increase funding for SYEP and the NYC Explorers and incorporate trades back into the public-school curriculum. It is imperative that we expand career options that highlight the skills and strengths of all our young people. Additionally, more should be done to collaborate with the unions on apprenticeship programs as well as working with private companies on internship programs. The District's many working families and single-parent households require no-cost after-school care. Free after-school care allows parents to work and maintain employment, keeps children safe and enhances children's educational attainment. It also allows families to use scarce financial resources on other pressing needs. Accordingly, we request that DYCD increase funding at existing organizations district-wide to provide after school programs. Trades can provide an excellent career path for those who do not want to attend a two- or four-year college. Partnering with local unions on apprenticeship programs can provide exceptional opportunities for our youth. ","","","","","General crime","","Crime in some areas has continued to increase across the district over the last two years. The numbers for felony assault and burglary have increased year-to-date over 2022: of significant note is a 23% increase in grand larceny auto.  That being said, we have seen a decrease in shooting incidents and shooting victims which is significant given the proliferation of guns on NYC streets.  The 44th Precinct does an outstanding job with its available resources.  During the warmer weather, people having limited options for outdoor recreation and entertainment has resulted in greater utilization of City parks and a much greater propensity to ""hang out"" on the street leading to a significant increase in street activity.   An investment in more officers assigned as Neighborhood Coordination Officers (NCOs) and more to the newly formed Public Safety Unit will help to address our needs during this unique period in history.","The Neighborhood Coordination Officers (NCOs) program has been well-received by Community District Four. The one critique which is consistent is the turnover which precludes the community from developing relationships with their respective NCO's. We continue to have an excellent rapport with the NYPD's 44th Precinct. They are committed, professional, and very responsive. We want them to be equipped with adequate personnel to handle the activity in the District as we focus on working together with the precinct to address all crimes, improve quality of life, and provide a safe environment for all residents. ","There are plans for a new EMS Station #17 to be built at 1257 Morris Avenue (Bronx Block 2450, Lot 42).  This would replace the facility currently located at 1080 Ogden Avenue.  We support the relocation of the existing facility and construction of the new facility to support the needs for FDNY EMS workers.  In addition, we advocate for the development of a youth/community center on the current site on Ogden Avenue to provide much needed services and programming to the youth of Highbridge.  ","","","","","Cleanliness/trash collection","","Overflowing garbage bags, sticky candy wrappers, used needles, broken beer bottles, shards of glass, dirty streets and filthy parks are not just a public nuisance; much like all else related to the pandemic and recession, they pollute and otherwise negatively affect New York’s poorest areas—and residents—disproportionately.  While the City was able to restore the budget to pre-pandemic levels, we still suffer from a lack of cleanliness districtwide and a significant increase in rats. The Clean Curbs Pilot Program should be offered to the 161st Street BID.  In addition, the Clean Curbs Residential Pilot should be promoted for residential property owners. DSNY should partner with the Bronx BP's office and other local elected officials to fund and promote these initiatives.  We urge the City to pursue public/private partnerships to bridge the funding that could provide insight. ","No comments","The cleanliness of the Capital District has taken a considerable turn for the worst over the last few years.  Garbage receptacles across the district continue to overflow daily.  Local parks are over run by mounds of garbage and rats are in command of local streets.  We must get back to basics in terms of more regular pickups, street cleanings and more receptacles in high traffic areas.  Community District Four has experienced difficulties with irregular cleaning and maintenance schedules for the extraordinary number of underpasses, step streets and sitting areas located in our district. We are still dealing with less service overall and a significant increase in garbage.  We recommend a concerted inter-agency approach to address high traffic areas.  While we understand that resources are limited for a number of reasons but we ask that given the increased levels of on-street activity that high traffic areas be given considerable attention and that resources be allocated accordingly. ","","","","","Affordable housing creation","","NYC is facing a number of issues that affects affordable housing.  It is estimated that there are currently more than 60,000 migrants and counting that are now being sheltered in NYC.  Some estimates indicate that by the end of 2022 there could be close to 100,000 people in the NYC shelter system .     Currently, HPD estimates more than 3,600 affordable housing units based on developer interest in their pipeline (According to latest estimates, May 2021).  We implore the City to implement Area Median Income (AMI) Income Averaging to ensure that any new affordable housing constructed in the district encompasses a wider range and mix of incomes as opposed to strict income ranges that do not support economic diversity within new housing stock.     The Emergency Rental Assistance Program (ERAP) has issued millions of dollars to tenants who were in arrears during the pandemic.  Now the challenge becomes making sure the money gets to landlords who need those funds to maintain buildings and pay taxes.  As of Sept. 22, 2022 the state had dished out $2.5 billion to fulfill 197,363 applications, an average award of $12,667, according to the state Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, which oversees the rent relief program.   According to a report issued by the NYC Comptroller's Office, Community District four has lost 202 units of affordable hosing from 2018-2022.  In addition the 10452 zip code had 5,263 eviction filings between 2018-2022, fourth highest in the city. These facts combined with a 31% increase in the homeless population over the last year and the influx of migrants makes the facilitation and production of affordable housing a top priority. ","Community District Four continues to evolve through a series of land use changes over the past several years including: Lower Concourse North (aka Bronx Point) and the Jerome Avenue Neighborhood Study. The Jerome Avenue Neighborhood Plan has committed considerable resources to the development of affordable housing, new open space and improvements to transportation infrastructure. Bronx Point will lead to the development of more than 1,000 units of affordable housing, more than 2 additional acres of open space through the expansion of Mill Pond park and improvements to key intersections on 149th street and Exterior Street. Over time as these changes come to fruition, the landscape in these areas and surrounding blocks will be significantly altered. Today nearly 160,000 people reside in Community District Four. This growth will continue while the community faces a number of challenges including high unemployment, rising rents, access to fresh food, open space, transportation and mobility, health and wellness and affordable housing. The district has a number of city-owned properties currently used for parking. These properties are woefully underutilized public resources. Many of the aforementioned issues and challenges could be addressed by changing the use of these parcels to better serve area residents needs. In October 2019, on behalf of Community Board Four the Urban Land Institute (ULI) conducted a Technical Assistance Panel (TAP) to develop ideas/recommendations around the redevelopment of these city-owned parcels.  Community Board Four supports the results of the panel's findings particularly those related to transportation, connectivity etc and encourages the City to pursue those recommendations regardless of development of a soccer stadium.  Given the devastation to our district due to COVID-19 now more than ever it is critical that these properties are leveraged in a manner that reflects the current needs of the community and maximizes the return on investment of these valuable public resources. When the City decides to redevelop these properties there are a number of initiatives we want included as part of any comprehensive plan for redevelopment of these sites.  They include but are not limited to the following: provide paid apprenticeships for Bronx and Community District Four residents to obtain viable pathways to skilled trades and high paying job opportunities within the construction field; This should begin in earnest so that area residents can be employed across the district in a variety of fields.  Development of cooperative-owned housing units in addition to affordable rental housing; HPD should allocate housing subsidy to facilitate the development of affordable owner-occupied housing opportunities in newly constructed buildings in addition to rental housing.   Conduct an on-street parking study throughout the district and pilot a permit parking program to mitigate traffic and parking impacts during stadium events, as well as general solutions to parking issues district-wide. Creation of a youth-based campus along the waterfront parcels adjacent to the Bronx Children's Museum to include an innovation lab, middle school and high school as well as a youth/community center and the creation of a state of the art Health & Wellness Center. ","Achieving economic diversity in the district is critical to it's growth and well-being; accordingly, we request that the City implement Area Median Income (AMI) Income Averaging to ensure that affordable housing constructed in the district encompasses a wider range and mix of incomes as opposed to strict income ranges that do not support economic diversity within new housing stock.  Additionally we request that the City invest in the development of cooperative-owned housing units in addition to affordable rental housing.  HPD should allocate housing subsidy to facilitate affordable owner-occupied housing opportunities in newly constructed buildings in addition to rental housing.  The immediate need is to ensure that current tenants remain in their homes, that buildings are properly maintained and that the number of homeless families in the NYC shelter system does not increase.  ","The district benefits from the regional draw of the 161St Street/Capital District area, including: the Bronx County Court; Bronx Supreme Court; the 161st Street BID; waterfront access; Bronx Terminal Market's million square feet of retail; and Yankee Stadium, which normally draws more than 3.5 million visitors per year. Major employers include Bronx Lebanon Hospital, the Yankees and Hostos Community College. Unemployment in the district is still high as compared to NYC overall, the state and nationwide. Furthermore, a large number of area residents are underemployed.  In order to increase the income levels and improve the socio-economic status of local residents we request significant investments in job training, job placement, skills assessment and business development. Related to jobs and skills development we advocate for skilled trade/licensed apprenticeships that can provide paid apprenticeships for Bronx and area residents to obtain skills for viable pathways to skilled trades and high paying job opportunities within the construction field and other well-paying careers.  Currently, the closest Workforce One Center is located in Hunts Point or on Fordham Road, both of which are inconvenient for area residents.  In order to serve the thousands of job seekers in the immediate area, existing and future business owners the city should develop a new Workforce One Center. This would bridge the gap between the existing centers and could focus specifically on the linguistic and educational needs of the district's large Latin, Caribbean, African-American, and West African immigrant populations.  In lieu of bricks and mortar we propose a virtual Workforce One Center to help people navigate city contracting, how to become an MWBE and develop job skills. We also request that SBS make their mobile unit available in various locations to bring their broad array of services and programs to the district.   Lastly, we request that EDC, HPD and SBS support the Jerome Avenue Revitalization Collaborative (JARC) whose mission/goal is to bring about inclusive economic growth and sustainability for local residents, employers and workers impacted by the Jerome Avenue rezoning.     ","","","","","Traffic congestion","","Congestion continues to be the number one issue related to transportation and mobility.  There continues to be a competition for on-street parking spaces.  New residential developments are underway throughout the district.  The Bronx Children's Museum and the Universal Hip Hop Museum openings will usher millions of patrons each year permanently changing the flow of traffic and pedestrians in the district.  These changes combined with the new dynamic of double-parking, not only for alternate side cleaning but everyday. Vehicles double park for hours with many of them unattended.  This creates serious issues for FDNY and EMS vehicles, particularly on narrow one-way streets   The District's traffic-related challenges will be exacerbated by new residential development, stadium life and an increase in film and television permits, if an investment in traffic management and mitigation measures is not undertaken immediately.   While we welcome economic activity with enthusiasm, area residents must benefit and certainly not be further disadvantaged by that activity.   Traffic congestion is a serious issue that negatively impacts residents' quality of life and the end benefit for residents remains to be seen.    We also request that those with parking placards not create additional parking in areas not designated for parking and adhere to the same rules as all other drivers. This issue has ballooned along the medians on the Grand Concourse (between 149th Street and 161st Street on the Grand Concourse and on the Grand Concourse between165th Street and McClellan Street.)  We recognize that this is more of an NYPD enforcement issue, but ask that DOT collaborate with NYPD on these issues as is feasible. We ask for cooperation from traffic enforcement to ensure the aforementioned and other rules and procedures are followed.   Lastly and most importantly as previously stated in the Housing & Land Use section we continue to press the issue of residential permit parking. The circumstances surrounding the Yankee Parking lots and their lack of benefit for area residents, coupled with the chaos created for navigating local streets during Yankee games and events warrants a fresh look at the impacts and creative solutions. Growth must be accompanied by the appropriate levels of investment in programming and services.  If residential permit parking is not the solution we need to understand why and more importantly we need the city to propose alternate solutions to the issue.  We cannot continue to accommodate population growth and increased traffic without proper mitigation tools. ","We continue to voice our concerns about traffic conditions in our District and advocate for the development of the East 153rd Street Bridge. While we understand the project remains in the projected capital plan, it is unfunded. We stand firm in our support for the bridge development, which we believe would ease traffic congestion along 149th and 161st Streets, as well as create much needed jobs and be an economic development driver for the district. In 2006 construction was to commence and the Department of Transportation received the Art Commission Award for Excellence in Design.  The proposed bridge is a single tower cable stayed bridge, located over the Old Mott Haven Rail yard, connecting Concourse Village West at the west end and Park Avenue at the east end. It would have been the first new bridge built in 50 years and the first cable-stayed vehicular bridge in New York City. Bronx Point which will include 1,000 units of affordable housing, retail, office space and the Universal Hip Hop Museum, the Bronx Children's Museum and the potential redevelopment of city-owned land subleased to Bronx Parking Development, underscore the critical need to develop the 153rd Street Bridge. It should be noted that none of the aforementioned projects were contemplated at the time the bridge was slated to be constructed. We should also note that City Island, an area with far less density rejected a state-of-the art design for a bridge and subsequently settled on a more straight-forward bridge that was completed several years ago.  Additionally, the passage of the Federal Infrastructure bill could provide the funding needed to jumpstart this economic catalyst. ","Access and mobility throughout the area is key. The MTA currently operates at 468 subway stations citywide and 230 bus routes. More than 80 percent of District residents use public transportation to commute to work and for other official/personal engagements. This includes the #4 train (one of the busiest in the entire network, which currently operates over capacity with no quantifiable plans to mitigate the issue), the B/D trains, and the Bx1/2 (the 6th busiest bus route in the city). It should be noted that the Bronx has the largest bus ridership of the five boroughs. Additionally, the District's population has increased nearly 22 percent between 2000-2020, and continues to grow with recent rezonings and expansion of commercial facilities. Consequently, improvements to existing transportation infrastructure--including increased service; increased accessibility for residents living with disabilities and families operating strollers; improvements to local streets; enhanced lighting, and the resurfacing of the 161st Street Corridor are top priorities. We request an increased investment in bus priority streetlights along Grand Concourse, 161st Street, 167th Street, 149th Street and 170th Street to move vehicles more quickly. We also request the city to study expanding subway ridership by extending the B train to the Bronx for all hours of operation and by exploring capital improvements such as creating a rail link under 149th Street to connect the 4 train to the 2 line so that the 3 train could be extended into the Bronx. ","","","","","Park care and maintenance","","Community Board Four represents the Bronx’s Capital District -- which includes the County Seat and significant parkland including Franz Sigel, Joyce Kilmer, Mullaly, Mill Pond, Macombs Dam and Claremont parks. We are very excited about the future investments to Grant Park, expansion of Mill Pond Park and the development of Corporal Fischer.  Given the existing open space network and pending additions to our parks portfolio, we respectfully request that the NYC Parks Department and local elected officials continue to invest in the maintenance of the District's many parks, playgrounds, and green spaces.  Community Board Four is also home to Yankee Stadium, which draws over three million visitors each year.  The stadium hosts more than 80 home games, the annual Pinstripe Bowl (NCAA), college football games, boxing, hockey and soccer matches and concerts annually.  In addition, a number of significant parks/cultural/community facility-related capital projects are underway in the District, including Bronx Point which includes upgrades and the expansion of Mill Pond Park and the Universal Hip Hop Museum, the opening of the Bronx Children's Museum and the expansion of the Bronx Museum of the Arts.  The cleanliness and upkeep of the district's parks, cultural assets, and community facilities are essential to the overall health and well-being of the District and are critical to the enjoyment of area residents and millions of visitors to the area each year.  In order to properly maintain our open space we support the Parks Department request for the following: additional staffing including Permanent City Parks Workers and City Seasonal Aides, who clean the park on a regular basis requesting additional Gardener’s and Associate Park Service Workers, Park Supervisors and additional City Seasonal Aides for peak season work April through October, increased number of Park Enforcement Officers, Additional Playground Associates, Recreation Specialists for Recreation Centers and vehicles to replace aging fleet vehicles. ","Open space and greening play an important role in quality of life for area residents and workers. Utilization of the district's green spaces has increased exponentially over the last few months. Community District Four benefits from some of the most active open space resources in the Borough with its proximity to Yankee Stadium which hosts baseball, soccer, hockey and football year-round and sees millions of visitors every year. We also have the greatest number of parks properties in the Borough (101) and counting.  As we look to increase our portfolio with the development and expansion of Grant Park, development of Corporal Fisher and the expansion of Mill Pond Park, maintenance and upkeep are critical for residents and visitors to benefit from our vast open space portfolio and to continue to attract tourists and public and private investment. Now more than ever the role of a Parks Administrator, additional PEP officers, maintenance and horticulture staff are on the critical path to maintaining the Capital District's competitive edge. ","We need to expand the education and recreation opportunities available to everyone in the district, particularly our young people. The Bronx Museum of the Arts, the Bronx Children's Museum and the Universal Hip Hop Museum are valuable resources for arts and culture that provide tremendous resources to the district and should receive consideration for additional staffing, funding and programming. In addition to monetary resources, we encourage partnership with cultural groups to promote positive programming in neighborhood parks. ","Community District Four has three branches of the New York Public Library (NYPL) system: Grand Concourse, High Bridge, and Melrose. According to NYPL statistics (below), in Fiscal Year 2022 the libraries in CB 4 had 96,067 visits and 4,318 program attendees.  It should be noted that the Melrose library was closed for renovations. As the city continues to emerge from the Covid-19 pandemic, we know that our youth have been disproportionately impacted, widening gaps between high and low needscommunities. NYPL is currently focused on youth and education with an emphasis on teens. Youth initiatives seek to address these gaps through equity and access to learning and development opportunities and resources from the time a child is born to their graduation from high school. In the fall of 2021, the Library launched its drop-in after school program, with free homework help, tutoring, and career exploration services. each site, additional tutoring support for younger students comes from Teen Reading Ambassadors-paid high school interns trained in literacy fundamentals and educational best practices as part of a workforce readiness effort. ● An integral piece to our youth and education priorities is our recently-launched Teens 360 initiative. This includes our new Teen Centers, which provide digital and tech toolslike state of the art recording studios and media labs to promote tech fluency, college and career mentoring, and inclusive spaces for exploration for young adults.  ● In January 2022, the library launched the Center for Educators (CES), which makes it easier for teachers and other educators to use our resources for their lessons, projects, and activities through access to high quality workshops and fellowships, new collections-based ready-to-teach lesson plans, exhibitions, and expert librarians.  As you know, libraries are often the first place that communities turn to for help and information, and our branches are uniquely positioned to provide relevant and up to date information to New York's most vulnerable populations. Libraries are a place for learning and for safe and open access to information. ","The pandemic created an environment where Community Boards were asked to step up and do considerable more with less.  We quickly pivoted from in-person to virtual meetings with very little technical support and essentially trained 40+ Board members on virtual meeting platforms.  There is no centralized budget that is allocated each fiscal year for critical items that every other city agency has including funding for hardware, software, upgrades and training.  If a Board wants any of these, they must be purchased from their own budget.  There are 59 Community Boards with a District Manager and at least one staff member and a minimum of 30 Board members.  If you aggregate all of those that is larger than several city agencies with budgets far more robust than Community Boards.  We cannot continue to operate under these conditions.  COVID-19 has transformed how we do business overnight.  The internet, social media and virtual meeting platforms are now an integral part of our day-to-day operations. We are experiencing an economic downturn of epic proportions and the essential work of Community Board is more important than ever; service delivery and advocacy are essential. Now more than ever, we are called upon with greater urgency to fill the gaps without the adequate financial resources to support those endeavors.  We are currently operating on an internal budget of $257,507 for a district with nearly 160,000 residents. Much of the Board's budget is pre-allocated for fixed expenses including rent, telephones and personnel. We are essential to community engagement and participation in all facets of city government and we believe wholeheartedly in fulfilling our mission to the best of our ability.  We have tremendous and important work ahead of us as we pick up the shattered pieces of the district.  With adequate fiscal support, Community Boards can go beyond essential service delivery and become an even more valuable resource for the community, the borough and the city.

It is bounded by the Harlem River to the West, in the Cross Bronx Expressway on the South, Webster Avenue on the East, and the northern boundary extends from Hall of Fame Terrace at Bronx Community College to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Blvd. and 183rd Street, East to Jerome Avenue and North to Fordham Road. The major streets running East to West are Fordham Road, Burnside and Tremont Avenues. The major streets running North and South are Jerome Avenue, Grand Concourse, Bainbridge, and 3rd Avenue. The Grand Concourse is a major North/South corridor. Our district overlaps with City Council districts 14, 15, and 16. Bronx Community District 5 is comprised of the following four neighborhoods: South Fordham, University Heights, Morris Heights, and Mount Hope. The overall population count in this district was 131,879 in 2012, the last year the data was made available, and its population density (1,000 persons per square mile) was 87.4. There was a 2.8 percent increase in the population from the year 2010. The racial diversity of our residents is rich and the majority of the population is Hispanic and Black/African American. According to the 2010-2012 American Community Survey (ACS) estimates, 68.6 percent of the population in this district is of Hispanic origin; 33.7 percent of the residents are Black/African American; 1.1 percent of the residents are Asian or Pacific Islander; 12.9 percent of the residents are White; 0.8 percent of the residents are American Indian or Alaska Native. The ACS estimated that of the Hispanic/Latino group, 6.4 percent of the residents are Mexican; 18.3 percent of the residents are Puerto Rican; 0.5 percent of the residents are Cuban; 43.5 percent of the residents identify themselves as part of another Hispanic or Latino group. There are also a significant proportion of residents that is foreign born. The population of foreign-born residents increased from 34.8 percent in 2000 to 43.4 percent in 2012. The ACS 2008-2012 data breaks down the region of birth of the foreign born population in our district: 12 percent of the foreign born population is African of which 11 percent is West African; 85 percent of the foreign born population is Latin American; 2 percent of the population is Asian; 1 percent of the population is European. The growth of our foreign born population and the large population of Hispanic or Latino residents has potentially impacted the primary languages represented in our district. Of the residents living in our district for five years and more, 70.2 percent speak a language other than English and Spanish speakers make up 62.3 percent of this group. In addition to race, the age groups contribute to the diversity of the residents living in this area. The population of residents in the 65 and older age group increased from 5 percent in 2000 to 8.2 percent in 2012. The households with children under 18 years old decreased from 55.4 percent to 43.9 percent from 2000 to 2012. Although there is a range in the socioeconomic makeup of the residents in the district, the percent of households living near the poverty line and who are considered to be low-income is high. The proportion of residents with a household income below $20,000 increased from about 35 percent to about 46 percent from 2000 to 2012. The poverty rate also increased from 40.6 percent to 42.3 percent from 2000 to 2012. It was ranked as one of the community districts with the highest number of households with the total income below the poverty level. For the year 2012, the median household income was $21,959 which is significantly less when compared to the Bronx overall ($33,006) and New York City ($51,750). It was ranked as one of the community districts with the lowest median household income levels. The percent unemployed is about 20.9 percent. The proportion of residents who used supplemental security income was 18.3 percent. The proportion of residents who needed cash public assistance income was 12.3 percent. The proportion of residents requiring food stamps/SNAP benefits was significant at 50.6 percent. Morris Heights is the lowest density area in District 5. Morris Heights is along the western ridge of the district, covering the area from Jerome Avenue valley to the Harlem River Valley. Here, the zoning ranges from R5 (typically 2 and 3-family row houses and small apartment buildings). In addition to the low density development, several high-rise developments including Sedgwick Houses, a NYC Housing Authority Development complex and several large private apartment towers along the Undercliff and Sedgwick Avenues, as well as River Park Towers along the Harlem River. University Heights is part of the same rock ridge that characterizes most of Morris Heights, and is similar, architecturally. One of the key landmarks in this area is the beautiful Bronx Community College Campus, which gives the neighborhood its name. This public facility is the highest geographic point in New York City. University Heights is the least dense area of the district and benefits from a large proportion of 1-4 family housing stock. The area East of Jerome Avenue and Fordham Road encompasses two neighborhoods: South Fordham, North of Burnside to Fordham Road, and Mount Hope, South of Burnside Avenue to the Cross Bronx Expressway. Both extend east to Webster Avenue. The Mount Hope/South Fordham neighborhoods are densely populated mostly with five and six-story housing. At the eastern edge of these neighborhoods is a large residential development known as Twin Parks West, consisting of four residential towers. At the northern portion of this area is the Fordham Road Shopping District, the third largest generator retail sales in the City of New York. Fordham Road has approximately 1-million square feet of retail space.  During these times of anxiety and financial stress, funding for the community's priorties are even more important.   ","","","","","Affordable Housing","","Community Board #5 has an old housing stock with over half our housing built before 1930, and it is defined as a primarily a multi-dwelling bedroom community. The home ownership rate in our district is categorized as having the lowest rates in the New York City community districts. It has a homeownership rate of 2.8 percent. Also, our district is ranked as having the highest number of renter households whose gross rent was more than 50 percent of their pre-tax income. Other issues affecting housing quality are increasing utility costs for landlords and homeowners; the percentage of housing with five or more maintenance deficiencies has increased over 35 percent; a lack of code enforcement (this district ranks in the top 20 in serious housing code violations throughout the City); an increase in building debts due to over-financing. Approximately 44.4 percent of the rental housing units considered overcrowded (our district ranks 6th overall in the City).    As the consequences of the Jerome Avenue Rezoning continue to be manifest, the need for affordable housing for the residents of the District has been enhanced. ","Schools","","There is a dearth of available school seats in our district, especially in elementary school seats.  Community Board 5 encompasses School Districts 9 and 10.  In CSD 9 the elementary school utilization rate is 118.23%   In CSD 10 the rate is 122.06% (Jerome Avenue Rezoning EIS; p. 4-13). Community Board 5 was especially hard hit by the COVID-19 pandemic.  There was prior to the health crisis a dearth of school seats in the District.  Compounding the health-related deprivations is the looming and extant development related to the Jerome Avenue Rezoning.  The lack of educational resources in the community are  an impediment to the district's economic and social thriving.  Redressing this deprivation would go a long way to improving the life-chances of our residents.

Community Board #5 currently has an unemployment of 18% compared to the Bronx overall unemployment rate of 8%. We have more than 10,000 households on cash assistance and 34,  000 cases for the SNAP. Which has impacted our median income of $24, 000 which ranks us as one of the five lowest within in the city according to the NYU Furman Center report.   The economy has been placed under great duress as a consequence of the current health crisis and the concomitant damage to the district's retail and other employers has been significant.  ","","","","","Chronic disease prevention and management (diabetes, heart disease, etc.)","","Our community has a high incidence for asthma and diabetes. Among adults the rate of hospitalizations for asthma are 571 per 100,000 adults. For the Bronx this rate is 508 and the average city-wide is 249. For children the rate for hospitalization is 55 in our community per 10,000 children between the ages of 5-14 years old. The rate for such children throughout the Bronx is 72 and for New York City the rate is 36. In regards to diabetes hospitalizations for adults, our community ranks as the sixth highest in the city. Per 10,000 adults we have a hospitalization rate of 616. For the Bronx the corresponding rate is 503. The rate of hospitalizations for New York City is 312. Among the leading causes of death in Community Board 5 diabetes related causes ranks 5th (26.7 per 100,000 adults). The rate of infant mortality and premature death (before the age of 65) is higher than city-wide. The infant mortality rate in Community Board 5 is 5.4 per 1,000 live births. For the Bronx his rate is 5.7. The New York City this rate is 4.7. By comparison the rate of infant mortality in the Upper East Side is 1.0. In our community the rate of premature death is 266.2 per 100,000 adults. The rate for the Bronx is 238.9 and the City is 198.4.","Within the Bronx, the infant mortality rate (IMR) remains extremely high for black women (including African American, African immigrants, and non-Hispanic Afro-Caribbean women) compared to the average IMR in the borough at the community level. This statistic is relevant for Community Board 5, since 33.7 percent of our residents are Black/African American. From 2007 to 2009, the IMR surpassed 10 deaths per 1,000 live births for black women under the age of 20 in the University/Morris Heights neighborhood. We urge the Department of Health Services to increase funding to address this health issue in our district. Also, Bronx Community Board 5 has the 4th highest number of asthma hospitalization in the City. Our district requests the DHS to increase funding for asthma treatment. Our other requests are an increase of funding for the expansion of the Pest Control Unit to add additional personnel and field inspectors/Exterminators, and to improve the teen pregnancy obesity programs in our district.","The elderly population in our district continues to increase. The proportion of the population group of 65 and older has increased from 5 percent to 8.2 percent from 2000 to 2012. We are requesting that the city provides for the special needs of our seniors especially for the recent seniors which require services that will keep them active. Community Board 5 is requesting that long range planning include housing, health and mental health care, home care and senior centers. With this approach, Community Board 5 feels we can improve their quality of life and prevent the isolation which many of our elderly are at risk for. Our priorities include: • Increase funding for the improvement of senior citizens' facilities in Community Board 5. • Increase funding for senior housing • Increase funding for innovative senior programs in Community Board District 5, such as a Naturally Occurring Retirement Community. ","bh","No comments","","","","","School and educational facilities (Capacity)","","A large proportion of our residents fall under the youth category. The 2010 U.S. Census showed that about 42 percent of our population is under the age of 18. Also, Community Board 5 is ranked as the district with the 4th highest number of households with children under 18 years old. Students are performing at the lower levels of the city wide average scores in reading and math subjects; only 14.4 percent of the students were performing at grade level in math and only 12.3 percent of the students were performing at grade level in reading. Thus, it is very important for the Department of Education to assist our district to provide adequate services intended for this age group. We are requesting that as housing developments occur in our district, there are sufficient funds available for the needs of the youth.","No comments","There is a dearth of programming for youth of all ages.  We need further resoourcesd for anti-gang/violence programms, especailly trying to combat youth against the elderly crime prevention.     ","","","","","General crime","","Community residents feel that the 46th police pct physical appearance and chaotic parking, sanitation, are contributing to the quality life of local residents, like the broken window theory.","Safety in our community is a major concern, and we believe more investment and efforts should be dedicated to strengthening the capacity of the police force in our district since District 5 still has some of the highest crime rates in the City. Also another primary objective is to expedite the process of acquiring and constructing a new 46th Precinct with parking facilities. This will definitely improve police department services and consequently improve the quality of life of our residents.     In addition, we request that the local police precinct increase funding for the Operation Clean Hallways program. It should work with the City’s Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) agency to stop indoor drug dealing and loitering. This has been a quality of life and public safety issue for our community. In order to maintain security and enhance livability in our community, we require that there be more attention focused on the indoor drug dealing issue in our district.    Our priorities for the NYC Police Department in our district include:  · Allocate funding to build a new front entrance ramp to make the existing 46th Police Precinct ADA accessible  · Increase funding for 911 emergency dispatchers to improve response time  · Increase funding to purchase noise meter devices and fire hydrant wrenches  · Increase funding for Narcotics’ Enforcement  · Increase funding for School Crossing Guards to assist students to navigate the wide street crossing corridors such as the Grand Concourse, University Avenue, and W. Tremont Avenue.   · Conduct a pilot initiative on Community Policing to enhance safety in our neighborhoods  . Install security cameras along selected streets.","Our priority for the NYC Fire Department is to increase funding for 911 dispatchers Emergency Response Time for Ambulance Services. The average response time from the 2013 Mayor’s Management Report for the city was 4:06 for structural fires, and the response time in the Bronx was 4:12. We believe it is necessary to improve the capacity of our Fire Department to maintain the safety of our residents. We also request additional funding for carbon monoxide detectors, and medical kits for: each of our Engine Company and Juvenile fire setters program.","","","","","Cleanliness/trash collection","","Community Board #5 has been a lock down community board with custodial hydrant locks since the early nineties. For the past ten years we have been top three in complaints. In the past four years we have been chosen for the HEAP Initiative. Community Board #5 welcomes this initiative but with changes for example: 1. the initiative is not operational until July, we would like to see it implemented earlier either late April or early May. 2. DEP should incorporate a speakers bureau to consist of DEP, FDNY, NYPD personnel and Community Boards in order to speak on the impact full running hydrants have on public safety property damage and the exorbitant cost of the city. 3. CB #5 recommends DEP change its policy on what agency is issued hydrant wrenches e.g. DSNY hydrants can be shut during am hours.","No comments","Although sanitation has improved in the district, it still has the lowest sanitation score card rating in the borough related to sidewalk and street cleanliness. Sanitation has continued to be an important priority for Community Board 5 to improve the quality of life and economic stability and growth within our district. Therefore, we are requesting an increase of funding for cleaning personnel for our six commercial districts on Fordham Road, South Grand Concourse (Fordham Road), Burnside Avenue, West 183rd Street, West Tremont Avenue and University Avenue, and Featherbed Lane. Also, we request funding for our Canine Unit, additional personnel for the 13 Step Streets, cleaning personnel for Grand Concourse and University Malls, sanitation equipment (for cleaning the Grand Concourse and the University Malls, tree pruning, and weed whackers), and for personnel to service garbage baskets in our district (especially in commercial areas).","","","","","Affordable housing preservation","","Community Board #5 has an old housing stock with over half our housing built before 1930, and it is defined as a primarily a multi-dwelling bedroom community.

","Jerome Avenue Neighborhood Study:   Jerome Avenue is a major street in our district running North and South, and the section we wish to focus on is an auto-body corridor from the Burnside Avenue to the Cross Bronx Expressway. The physical appearance of this corridor has a negative impact on the residents’ quality of life. Even though this corridor provides some employment opportunities (but not necessarily to residents in our community), we believe that the businesses should be relocated to another location. The objective is to change the existing C8 zoning along Jerome Avenue with the support of stakeholders and community members. We believe this is an opportunity area for mixed-use development, and request for a zoning change to residential with a commercial overlay. This is also an opportunity for affordable housing on Jerome Avenue, and the establishment of an Inclusionary Housing Program can be a tool to incentivize this type of housing development along the corridor.     Many community stakeholders have suggested that Jerome Avenue be revitalized to meet existing area needs and plan for the future. Through the planning process, City Planning and sister agencies will seek to address the needs of local residents, businesses, and institutions. The study and resulting community plan will evaluate and identify opportunities to promote a range of elements to support community vitality: affordable housing, job growth and training, economic development, cultural activities, pedestrian safety, parks, schools and daycare, retail and services. The study and plan will promote coordinated investments in infrastructure and services to shape a resilient, sustainable community. The study and plan will include land use and zoning changes and the application of a mandatory Inclusionary Housing program within the area to promote affordable housing. Bronx Community Board #5 is waiting for the Department of City Planning zoning and planning framework for Jerome Avenue Neighborhood Study.","No comments","No comments","","","","","Bus service and quality (frequency, access, crowding, etc.)","","A large proportion of our residents, about 68.2 percent, use public transportation to commute to work. Other popular modes of commuting to work include driving to work alone (11.5 percent) or carpooling (5.8 percent), or walking (9.6 percent). The objective of Bronx Community Board 5 is to improve the existing transportation infrastructure. The resurfacing of our most important street, the Grand Concourse from 175th to Fordham Road, is an important priority for our district. The objective is to initiate a greening project which would be vital for enhancing the beautification and improving economic development in the area.     Also, due to the heavily utilized major thoroughfares in our district (including Grand Concourse, Fordham Road, University Avenue, and Tremont Avenue), traffic  mitigation efforts are of paramount importance.    Sep street maintenance is important as the district's 13 step streets are a feature of significant aesthetic and pedestrian circulation value.","No comments","No comments","","","","","Library facilities and access","","The two libraries that serve our community, Francis Martin and Sedgwick Branch libraries are vital components of the cultural and educational resources in our community.  The ongoing physical, programming and aesthetic accessibility of these branches are of vital concern.  These libraries are hubs for community activity.  They have also developed innovative programming through the 'Summer Reading in the park' program.  Sunday/expanded  hours would be of great benefit once the facilities are able to return to normal operations.","No comments","Immigration: The foreign born comprises more than one-third of the population within Community Board #5. In order to serve our immigrant residents a increase in funding is needed to enable our immigrant population to integrate into the social and economic fabric of Community Board #5.","Community Board 5 (Bronx) has two branches of the New York Public Library (NYPL) system: Francis Martin and Sedgwick.  These are vital resources for our community.     • Based on a 2015 report from the Center for an Urban Future, libraries in the Bronx saw the biggest increase in program attendance and circulation out of the five boroughs. The Bronx has seen a 225 percent increase in program attendance and a 35 percent increase in circulation. Data shows that these statistics will continue to increase throughout the New York public Library system.   • The libraries are especially important to low and moderate income residents who depend on the libraries for access to books, internet access, job search and film and as the only quiet place to read or do homework or other work.  • Residents who have laptop computers but cannot afford internet fees use the library for internet access.  • The arts and cultural programming along with English for Speakers of Other Languages and Out-of School Time programs in the neighborhood are extremely important to many residents, particularly families with children and seniors, who cannot otherwise afford access to commercial alternatives.  An initiative that is being explored is to bring the library to local parks during the summer school break.  We are exploring how the library at Francis Martin (to begin with) may bring materials and dedicate staff to a ‘reading in the park’ initiative.    • The NYPL libraries within CB 5 (Bronx) are used extensively. The community relies on them to provide essential library services, as well as educational programs and community space. Many of the library locations are in need of critical upgrades, including mechanical systems, bathrooms, roofs, facades and ADA upgrades. While other locations are in need of a complete renovation   • The NYPL will continue to work with the Mayor, Speaker, City Council and local elected officials to increase capital funding.","No comments","","","","","Explanation","","","","","","","","","","BX5","","","","","","","","","","",""

Eviction case filings against one in five residents every year indicates the underlying poverty, employment and housing characteristics predispose tenants to housing court involvement. Community Board 6 has insufficient social and legal services to help residents avoid housing court. Community Board 6 has done its fair share in contributing to adding to the city's housing stock, and more than its fair share in providing housing for at-needs populations. The over-concentration of these facilities creates a significant transient population in our District.","Crime and Public Safety","","Community Board 6 has disproportionately high rates of crime and violent crime. Community Board 6 encourages the city to develop public-health and economic approaches to reducing crime in our District.","Economic recovery and development","","Community Board 6 leads the city in unemployment, and only 56% of residents participate in the labor market. Despite two Workforce One sites and one Business Solution Center in our District, businesses and jobseekers continue to be underserved by the city.

This indicates the various subpar health outcomes in our district.   Despite an increasing percentage of seniors, there are only two DFTA funded senior centers in Community District 6, one of which is facing the possibility of closure in 2024. Despite having the city's 2nd highest eviction rate, there is only one eviction-prevention social service program in Community District 6 (with one staff person). The concentration of DHS facilities in a community (while desperately needed) without sufficient resources to lift shelter residents out of poverty is a clear lack of planning on behalf of New York City and a detriment to the lives of residents in shelter and in Community District 6.","According to the Community Health Profiles 2018 report, there were 464 child asthma hospitalizations; 36% of adults in our district are obese; 32% of residents suffer from hypertension; 22% suffer from diabetes; and there were 1,160 psychiatric hospitalizations in our district- all of the stats mentioned were above the Bronx and the City's average.

Thus residents rely on bus service which is often delayed and crowded. Bus service needs to be improved especially since the neighborhood's population is increasing with new housing developments.","","Residents often complain of subways not working, running on time etc. MTA does not have in place cleaning crews for the upkeep of surrounding areas, cutting weeds, garbage etc.  At the start of Vision Zero, the 2015 Bronx Pedestrian Safety Action Plan indicated that at $32,460, the Bronx's median household income was the lowest of the five boroughs, making it the poorest urban county in the United States. The Bronx's car ownership rate was the lowest outside of Manhattan, with only 48% of households having access to a vehicle. Today, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in an approximate 25% unemployment rate in Bronx Community Board 6.

The district extends from Webster Avenue at the East to Goulden Avenue and the Harlem River to the West. The North end boundary of the district starts from the south end of Woodland Cemetery (E 211th Street) to Fordham Road and West 183rd Street on the South end. The area is served by two subway lines, D and 4, and Metro-North service from/to Westchester County and Grand Central Station. There are several major institutions that are our neighbors, such as Lehman College, Montefiore Hospital and the New York Botanical Garden. The Community Board is also home to two recognizable high schools, Bronx High School of Science and DeWitt Clinton High School and 34 public schools. Nonetheless, the number of school seats available in our community is a major issue of concern for local residents.   Among all New York City Community Boards, CB7 has the 4th highest percentage of households with children under 18 years old. In fiscal year 2018, the School Construction Authority (SCA) had identified the need for more than 2,000 seats in the 5 neighborhoods within the boundaries of CB7. As of this date the available number of school seats has remained the same; and the creation of additional seats has not kept pace with our growing youth population and new housing development. In the upcoming years the district will see a surge of over 3,000 additional residential units (based on DOB data). As a result, the quality of learning in most of our schools, which are already experiencing overcrowding, will be further impacted and continue to grow into a more serious problem.   Additionally, the district is densely populated with approximately 73,000 residents per square mile. Approximately 45% of the residents in the community are foreign born and have limited English Proficiency (35%). They mainly live in rental units in multi-family buildings that make up about 97% of the neighborhoods. Homeownership has been on the decline in recent years with only 6% of the district owning a home, condo or cooperative. Many of the private homes in our neighborhoods have disappeared to make way for new residential buildings with Supportive and Affordable Housing Units. These new developments take advantage of zoning laws to build taller buildings, in order to maximize the number of units. We (CB7) would like to ensure housing is being built responsibly to accommodate the current fabric of our neighborhoods and population growth by increasing municipal services. While the district has some of the most affordable market rental housing in the city, our district also has a history of high eviction rates and rent burden (55% of our residents pay more than 30% of their salaries in rent). Therefore, affordable mixed income housing, homeownership (open-door programs and CLT) and other subsidy programs to help tenants stay in their homes are a priority. As residential development occurs in the district, there is a need for additional municipal services, such as transportation, sanitation and parks maintenance.   Public Transportation is a major concern of the Community Board. CB7 residents must endure some of the longest commutes in the city on crowded trains and buses. Further, many services are not frequent enough to make them reliable to serve a growing population. High fares discourage residents from using the Metro-North service to access jobs in Manhattan. Additionally, provisions for services such as a shared bike program and ferry services on the Harlem River would provide the community with additional travel options.   Community residents have excellent access to neighborhood parks and green spaces, such as Mosholu Parkway and Williamsbridge Oval Park. These open spaces have experienced an increase in use and provided our residents with a relief to the lockdown experience due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This has also created more garbage and demand for sanitation services in our parks. The Bronx has always received the lowest budget allocations for service delivery. Now, during the recent budget cuts our residents have experienced a further decline in their quality of life. The overall maintenance services from the sanitation and parks departments are of special need.  ","","","","","Land use trends","","CB 7 is in need of quality, mixed income housing, as housing accommodations continue to be one of the primary issues facing district residents. While the district has some of the most affordable private market rental housing in the city, many rent-stabilized and rent-controlled apartments are disappearing due to evictions and tenant turnover. To make matters worse, the district is seeing an influx of new residents who have been priced out of other neighborhoods in New York City, increasing competition for the affordable units available in the district.  There is also a prevailing feeling in our district that we have received a disproportionate share of supportive housing developments, which  serve a population that does not currently reside in the district. ","Schools","","The quality of and lack of funding for our local schools continues to be of paramount importance for our residents. The number of seats available in our community has not kept pace with the need resulting in overcrowding in many of our schools.  The COVID-19 pandemic proved that access to technology and remote learning is a critical component for student learning. As we experience a significant increase in the number of residents,  we task the city to support educational opportunities and add seats to accommodate our present and future students. Failure to address these inequities in educational services and resources will persist and negatively impact the ability of our students to achieve academic success. During the pandemic we saw the need for students and families to access food programs and additional technological resources such as computer equipment and Wi-Fi. Failure to address these inequities in educational services and resources will persist and negatively impact the ability of our students to achieve academic success.","Other - Write In (Required)","","Insufficient Municipal Services: We have seen a dramatic increase in our population due to new residential development. However, services such as transportation, sanitation and parks maintenance have not increased to meet new demands. CB 7 needs city agencies to deliver additional services to maintain our quality of life and accommodate our population growth.","","","","","Services for low-income and vulnerable New Yorkers","","Communities within the Bronx consistently rank among the highest in rates of health disparities and lowest in positive health outcomes. According to the 2018 NYC Community Health profile, the rate of avoidable hospitalizations among adults in Community Board 7 is more than double the citywide rate and the adult obesity rate is 33%, which is higher than the rest of NYC. In 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic disproportionately affected Bronxites and individuals with comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension and who were more at risk for complications. As the city moves into recovering from the COVID-19 health pandemic, Community Board 7 requests dedicated resources that are linguistically and culturally competent to educate the public about infectious diseases, and the importance of healthy lifestyles and accessing routine medical care to keep our neighbors and residents healthy and to address long-standing health disparities.","No comments","No comments","No comments","No comments","","","","","School and educational facilities (Capacity)","","Community Education Council 10, which includes most of our district, is the most overcrowded district in the Bronx. As a result, principals are now forced to transform school libraries, gymnasiums, laboratories, lunchrooms, and closets into classrooms. Students are unsuitably confined to these unorthodox spaces and as a result, there has been a significant reduction in primary and supplemental opportunities for recreation and exploration. There is substantial evidence that overcrowding has an adverse impact on learning, and our students, already impacted by other societal ills, must be provided with high quality school resources and educational facilities. ","No comments","No comments","","","","","Public nuisance (noise, other disturbances)","","Public Nuisance (noise, other disturbances) Bronx Community Board 7 has seen a dramatic increase in public nuisance complaints. These complaints all involve our quality of life and safety for district residents. We need a coordinated effort among city agencies to step up their enforcement of illegally parked/abandoned cars, illegally motorized vehicles being recklessly driven on sidewalks and green spaces, noise complaints, loitering, and littering. Our community needs more of a positive and engaging police presence in neighborhoods with numerous complaints that improves quality of life without over policing. ","No comments","No comments","","","","","Cleanliness/trash collection","","The office receives a high volume of complaints related to the cleanliness of the district. Specifically, the complaints are related to dog waste, illegal dumping and cleanliness of residential and commercial areas. Enforcement of sanitation laws and a culturally sensitive public education campaign targeted to residential and commercial property owners can result in a reduction of these violations and greatly improve the quality of life for CB 7 residents.","No comments","No comments","","","","","Affordable housing creation","","CB 7 residents are constantly dealing with housing and rental issues. Tenants have rights and should be afforded more services to help them address issues such as rent increases, code violations, and evictions. We see too often how our residents are living in poor conditions because landlords take rents but fail to adequately maintain their buildings. Poor living conditions can affect a household’s quality of life, jobs, family well-being, and mental health. There is also a need for mixed income housing and affordable homeownership opportunities to accommodate households in different income brackets.","No comments","No comments","No comments","","","","","Subway service and quality (frequency, access, crowding, etc.)","","CB 7 residents must endure some of the longest commutes in the city on crowded trains and buses. Further, many services are not frequent enough to make them reliable or serve a growing population. For instance, peak express service is only provided on the D train for five hours per day. Compare this to other similar lines such as  the 6 or 7, where peak express service is provided 10-14 hours per day. Infrequent bus service, even on core routes, means seniors are waiting too long for bunched buses at inadequate bus stops. Finally, high fares and infrequent service discourage residents from using the Metro-North service to access jobs in Manhattan. Additionally, provisions for services such as a shared bike program and ferry services on the Harlem River would provide additional travel options. Providing the services described above will help with the congestion of public transit and aid in the post COVID-19 pandemic recovery.","No comments","No comments","","","","","Quality of parks and park facilities","","The district is home to a large number of parks and parkways, making it one of the greenest districts in the city. The vast amount of parkland makes it difficult to provide the necessary level of maintenance to keep the parks clean and safe. Additional investment is needed in both maintenance personnel and equipment in the district.","No comments","No comments","","No comments","","","","","Explanation","","","","","","","","","","BX7","","","","","","","","","","",""

Totaling 3.3 square miles, Community District 8 covers the neighborhoods of Spuyten Duyvil, Kingsbridge, Kingsbridge Heights, Fieldston, Riverdale, Marble Hill and Van Cortlandt Village.  Bronx Community Board 8 has an estimated 106,924 population, which is a growth of over 5,000 residents over the past ten years. Over 20,000 of our residents are younger than eighteen years old. Almost twenty percent of our residents are 65 and older. Over 48% of our residents identify as Hispanic/ Latino, 31% Caucasian, 10% Black and 5% Asian. Education, youth, and aging issues are very important to our Community Board. 16% of our residents have incomes below the NYC poverty threshold. As a result, we have an increased need for social services, especially for our aging residents and young people. Marble Hill is unique in that it is considered a part of the Borough of Manhattan, but municipal services are provided by the Bronx. However, Marble Hill data is not included in our city planning profile.   There are over 45,000 total housing units in our District. Community Board 8 has two New York City Housing Authority Developments: Marble Hill & Fort Independence Houses. Our District has various types of housing including cooperative apartments, condominium units, one family houses, 2-4 family houses and multi-family apartment buildings. 45% of our residents consider themselves rent burdened.  Since our Board is surrounded by the Harlem River, Spuyten Duyvil Creek and the Hudson River the need for storm resiliency measures that will protect our communities is imperative. Some neighborhoods were severely affected by the recent hurricanes and tropical storms. Our aging infrastructure cannot handle extreme weather, causing flooding and raw sewage backups. We consider this an environmental justice issue.    ","","","","","Affordable Housing","","Bronx Community Board 8 needs affordable housing for families and seniors. Forty five percent of our residents are rent burdened, meaning they spend more than one third of their salary on rent. New York City’s Area Median Income (AMI) is determined by the Federal Government and includes Westchester County & Long Island which affects what is considered affordable in the five boroughs. We advocate for affordable housing for our older adult population so that our residents can age in place. We support increased funding for housing subsidies for current residents to avail themselves of neighborhood preferences in new and existing affordable housing developments. Bronx Community Board 8 recognizes the need for additional affordable housing for families in the district as well.   Bronx Community Board 8 is home to two New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) developments: Fort Independence Houses, which is home to 482 residents and Marble Hill Houses, which is home to 3,222 residents Both developments are in dire need of capital repairs. Residents face regular and long-term heat and hot water disruptions due to aging boilers. For years, Bronx Community Board 8’s number one budget priority has been the repairs and replacement for the boilers at both Marble Hill & Fort Independence. Both developments require comprehensive roof repairs. The walkways and sidewalks at Marble Hill Houses are hazardous and need restoration. The apartments need major renovations due to mold issues, old radiators and outdated kitchens and bathrooms. Older residents need safety accommodations such as the installation of grab bars in their bathrooms. NYCHA needs sufficient personnel to adequately monitor cameras at the Marble Hill Houses. There are security concerns as main doors to buildings do not have proper entry security such as working locks and buzzers. ","Parks and open space","","Bronx Community Board 8 has 68 parks and open greenspaces. Our District also has the most step streets in New York City. Our residents deeply value and heavily use our parks and playgrounds. There is a lack of maintenance and increased need for Parks Enforcement Patrol (PEP) officers to enforce park rules remain a serious concern for both park users and neighbors who live near parks. The heavily used twenty six step streets require regular maintenance to ensure safety for pedestrians. One of our top expense budget priorities for Bronx Community Board 8 is additional Parks Enforcement Officers to monitor our parks. Our community desperately needs PEP officers to properly enforce the rules and regulations of city parks, enforce no use of motorized bikes, scooters, etc. on the recently paved Putnam Greenway, increased illegal BBQ’s and parties. In addition to enforcement our local parks require parks equipment such as a new garbage truck, crew cab pickup, Deere tractor with cutting unit, mini packer and gator for Van Cortlandt Park. The garbage truck and mini packer for Van Cortlandt Park will help deal with the increased trash in our parks. Other equipment is needed for maintaining parks and transporting staff and equipment. We request additional lighting along the Jerome Park Reservoir for pedestrian safety and to help deter illegal dumping.   Bronx Community Board 8 advocates for the redesign and reconstruction of Bailey Playground. For years, we have advocated for the daylighting of Tibbetts Brook; we are asking for continuous maintenance and operation funds to preserve the daylighting project in Van Cortlandt Park and along the Putnam Greenway. We continue to advocate for additional funding to reconstruct and update Old Fort Four Park and Washington’s Walk.   One of our most valuable community institutions, Kingsbridge Heights Community Center (KHCC), may possibly face imminent closure, displacing its programs, which serve 1500 residents weekly by providing essential services to expectant mothers, infants, children, youth, and families. KHCC is located in a landmarked building at 3101 Kingsbridge Terrace. The building is severely compromised by deteriorated mortar and damaged flashing, which is causing leaks that are damaging walls and ceilings. Prior to the pandemic, funding was in place to address these conditions through a combination of City funding  and non-City funding. The damage has recently worsened and there is now an unfunded gap of $1.5 million. The building is owned by the Department of Parks & Recreation but they do  have a capital projects budget. If the additional funding cannot be quickly secured, the building may be forced to close, displacing staff and the many residents who use the building for its programs.   ","Senior services","","One in five of our residents is over the age of 65. Community Board 8 is committed to the safety and improvement of quality of life for our older residents. We support increased funding for older adult centers run by the Department of the Aging. Increased funding would ensure qualified staff, access to mental health services, funding for social workers, technology upgrades and provide food security for our older population. The need for mental health services has increased significantly since the pandemic began. Food security has become an increased concern in our communities. There is a need for congregate food programs, additional pantries and meal deliveries for those who are homebound. Safer crossings, accessory pedestrian signals (visual & auditory), increased bus and Access-a-Ride services are critical district-wide needs. Community Board 8 supports an increase in crossing guards in our district as well as increased traffic enforcement to ensure pedestrian safety. Since the pandemic began, CB8 has witnessed a growing digital divide amongst older residents. Our Community Board supports funding for internet access for older residents as well as technology upgrades to older adult centers, and personal devices for older adults.","","","","","Services for domestic violence victims","","Domestic Violence is one of the leading crimes within the confines of the 50th Precinct. Between 2020 and 2021, the Bronx had the most chronic Domestic Violence Complaints, almost twice as much as any other borough.  In order to protect our vulnerable residents, CB8 urges the city to increase funding of the domestic violence unit within NYPD 50th Precinct. The 50th Precinct is home to Safe Horizons, an organization that offers support and aims to decrease domestic violence. We support an increase of community workshops to educate residents about warning signs of domestic violence, lists of shelters available to victims and to likely incoming migrants, how to obtain protective orders, and counseling services available to residents. Bronx Community Board 8 recognizes the need for affordable housing options for domestic violence victims in the district. ","CB8 advocates for increased agency outreach for those affected by COVID-19, family crisis counseling, and other mental health problems, including service staff for suicide prevention hot-lines and other mental health professionals. CB8 supports additional funding for Coronavirus home test kits to help decrease infection rates within CB8 to assist decreasing clinic and hospital visits.  ","One of five of CB8 residents are 65 and older.  Community Board 8 is committed to the safety and improvement of quality of life for all of our our aging residents. We are committed to the increase mental health services and innovative programs at our senior centers. The need for mental health services has increased significantly during the pandemic. Pedestrian safety for seniors includes  safer crossings and ccessory pedestrian signals (visual & auditory). Increased bus and Access-a-Ride services are critical district-wide needs.  ","An increase in outreach services is needed to connect with homeless New Yorkers and provide them with the resources that they not only need, but are entitled to. We support an increase in prevention services, outreach services and permanency assistance for homeless residents.  ","","","","","","School and educational facilities (Maintenance)","","Twenty percent of Bronx Community Board 8 residents are younger than 18 years old. Bronx Community Board 8 strongly supports the maintenance of our schools. There are twenty public schools and numerous private and charter schools in our district. School safety & access to a good education is paramount to our Community Board and residents.   Bronx Community Board 8 advocates for the renovation of the PS 24 Auditorium which is currently in disrepair. We support funding for safety cameras at HS 368 to ensure safety for students and teachers. Equipment was purchased but there was no funding for outdoor cameras to complete the security system. This school also requires an upgrade at the school library.  For several years the Board has requested funding for career & technical education at Marie Curie HS for Nursing and Professions which was approved by the School Construction Authority but never funded. Proper maintenance of school infrastructure would help with the expansion of after school programs and extra curricular activities for students.   The pandemic uncovered a digital divide among our communities, especially for students, especially students living in shelters.  Our world was forced to become virtually connected overnight, whether it was our schools, doctors and programs, but many did not and still do not have reliable broadband access. Bronx Community Board 8 advocates for internet access for students.   In addition to these requests, Bronx Community Board 8 supports funding for additional school safety officers at the John F. Kennedy HS campus as well as school crossing guards throughout the district.   ","School aged children comprise a significant component of our population. Our young people deserve a safe and supportive learning environment to further their development. Many of our schools have unsatisfactory libraries, technology and physical education spaces.  "," CB8 recognizes inequity in technology access, lack of mental health counseling for young people and the space they need to learn successfully. CB8 advocates for the expansion of SYEP for 14 & 15 year olds as well as expanding College Access for All for all our middle school students.  Our CB urges for the increase of school crossing guards, particularly at P.S.95, to ensure the safety of our children. CB8 requests additional domestic violence services for families in our district.  ","","","","","General crime","","Like other communities in New York City, our district has seen an uptick in crime, lack of enforcement and an increase in quality of life complaints. The Community Board strongly advocates for additional NYPD support for the 50th Precinct and an increase of  Argus cameras throughout our community and our subway stations to help deter crime and assist the NYPD in investigations. Lack of traffic enforcement, a decrease in Police Officers and an increase in crime have lead to more quality of life complaints. Our residents complain about illegal parties, loud music, illegal Cannabis Shops, scooters and ATV's on sidewalks and in parks, etc.  In addition to these requests, Bronx Community Board 8 supports funding for additional school safety officers at the John F. Kennedy HS campus as well as school crossing guards throughout the district, especially at PS 95 and PS 344 . ","Public Safety is extremely important to residents and merchants of CB8. Quality of life is a major concern to residents of CB8. Our district has seen an increase of car theft, illegal bbq'ing and late night parties in our parks, drag racing on our streets and noise complaints throughout the district. Noise complaints are the number one 311 complaint in CB8 and throughout NYC.  We work closely with our local precinct regarding these concerns, but we advocate for a better response to these quality of life complaints. Unfortunately, CB8 has seen its fair share of hate crimes, which require police presence ans support, especially at local religious institutions.   ","We saw the need for emergency services during the pandemic and CB8 continues to advocate for additional funding in emergency services so that we can improve the response time in our district. CB8 would like to see funding restored to maintain FDNY Paramedic Unit in CB8 (to replace canceled 27 Victor Unit). ","","","","","Environmental concerns affecting citizens","","The Environmental Justice (EJ) areas of Bronx Community District 8 are the focus of needs shared by the entire district. These areas, which include Kingsbridge Heights, Kingsbridge, Marble Hill, and the border of North Riverdale with Yonkers, are delineated by the two-criterion adopted by the Mayor’s Office of Climate Policy: they are majority non-white; and 23.59 % of the households are at or above the poverty rate. Bronx Community District’s Core Infrastructure, City Services, and Resiliency Needs are magnified in these Environmental Justice areas.  Throughout the district, construction is having a negative impact on quality of life, measured by noise, commercial dumping, and asbestos related complaints. EJ areas have documented need for relief from construction related air and noise pollution, and illegal dumping. Construction complaints demand pro-active enforcement instead of a complaint driven system.   Kingsbridge, Marble Hill EJ neighborhoods suffer from air pollution created by the Major Deegan expressway, and illegal dumping along the highway and Metro North corridor. They also suffer from flooding caused by Combined Sewer Overflow along the Broadway sewer line. Bronx Community Board 8 is known for its green parkland and its absence of right-of-way green infrastructure to address flooding where it occurs in Kingsbridge and Marble Hill. ","In order to reduce the problem of Combined Sewer Overflow (CSO) we advocate for construction of right-of-way and public retrofit green infrastructure projects in high/flow flood-prone areas of the district such as Broadway. CB8 has long advocated for the daylighting of Tibbetts Brook, which will divert and prevent billions of gallons of water from overwhelming our combined sewer system and polluting our rivers. It has long been a priority of CB8 that New York City complete the purchase of the right-of-way from CSX railroad that is located alongside the Major Deegan Expressway from West 230thto Van Cortlandt Park South in order to create a greenway. With three access points to the commercial Broadway area, the greenway has enormous recreational, environmental, and commercial benefits for the Kingsbridge community.  ","CB8 is supported by a great DSNY district staff and have one of the cleanliest districts in NYC. Illegal dumping remains a problem and we work with DSNY Enforcement. The Jerome Park Reservoir and park and playgrounds along Bailey Avenue have become a commercial dumping ground with no agency accountable for cleanup. CB8 recognizes the need for additional services in busy areas such as W 242nd Street, W 231st Street and W 225th St. CB8 has the most step streets in NYC and advocates for additional sanitation services at the 26 step streets. These areas have intense enforcement needs from district and borough-based DSNY teams.    ","","","","","Land use and zoning","","Because this category is so broad, it is difficult to choose one important issue dealing with housing, economic development, and land use.   For several years the board has seen a major uptick in development throughout the district. We note that due to lack of contextual zoning, many one- and two-family homes are sold, razed and built into seven story apartment buildings. Bronx Community Board 8 urges developers to maintain the character of the neighborhood and supports neighborhood preservation as well as scale zoning. Large scale developments affect our municipal services and put a strain on our infrastructure, emergency response time, school enrollment, parking and traffic congestion. This is evident all over the district. Too often developers demolish and build without proper permits. Bronx Community Board 8 is home to a Special Natural Area District and many times Building Inspectors are unfamiliar with the rules and regulations. We advocate for additional funds for increasing the number of building inspectors and training for building inspectors.  We support an increase in funding for NYCHA maintenance for our two housing developments, including funding for security such as outdoor cameras and new entry door locks.   Bronx Community Board 8 is comprised of predominantly small businesses. We support an increase in funding to Small Business Services (SBS) to provide more service oriented support for small businesses.  ","CB8 advocates for smart development and contextual zoning when developing in the district. We support neighborhood preservation and working with the Land Use Community on development projects.   ","Our budget priorities call for significant improvements for Marble Hill and Ft. Independence Houses. The NYCHA Developments are in dire need of major refurbishments to its mechanical systems. Residents often find themselves without heat and hot water for long periods due to malfunctioning boilers. Other urgent needs include renovation of kitchens at Fort Independence Houses, and sufficient personnel for full staffing of all caretaker and skilled worker positions, including rodent control. We support equitable and independent living for senior residents, and request funding for grab bars to be installed in bathrooms to ensure safety.  ","Our business community is extremely important to CB8 and we work with local organizations to remove bureaucratic red tape, link businesses with city resources and support local endeavors. Many Mom and Pop stores and restaurants have suffered severely due to the pandemic. We advocate for making our commercial areas safer, as indicated by our request for strategically placed Argus Security Cameras to fight crime. Maintaining attractive commercial areas is critical to their success and enhances the well being of our residents. BXCB8 requires more litter baskets and more frequent pick up service in our heavily trafficked commercial areas in order to alleviate unsightly litter caused by overfilled baskets. ","","","","","Traffic safety and enforcement (cars, scooters, ebikes, etc.)","","Bronx Community Board 8 advocates for increased traffic safety and enforcement throughout the district year after year. Community Board 8 receives many complaints about loud vehicles, speeding vehicles, scooters and e-bikes on sidewalks and in parks, particularly Van Cortlandt Park. We are in constant communication with the 50th Precinct regarding traffic enforcement. Bronx Community Board 8 has many dangerous intersections that require traffic safety and enforcement. One of our top capital priorities is the reconstruction of the Van Cortlandt Park Bailey Ave Pedestrian Plaza to help create a safer entrance to Van Cortlandt Park and the area in general. We strongly support reconstruction of our step streets. We advocate for safer pedestrian signals near our schools and senior centers. Community Board 8 requests funding for a Major Deegan Expressway Storm water management study which will have an impact on Van Cortlandt Village and Kingsbridge Heights. We also advocate for the study of safe pedestrian bicycle connections along the Putnam Greenway from Bailey Ave to the Broadway Bridge. We support an increase in funding for school crossing guards especially at PS 95 and PS 344. We support increased lighting along the Jerome Park Reservoir to help promote pedestrian safety. ","CB8 recognizes the importance of maintaining safe streets and sidewalks throughout our community for both traffic and pedestrian safety. CB8 supports the reconstruction of the Van Cortlandt Park Bailey Pedestrian Plaza integrating green infrastructure to capture storm water while making it a safe pedestrian plaza. We advocate for the reconstruction and regularly scheduled maintenance of our step streets. BXCB8 has 26 step streets, the most of any district in NYC, some of which desperately need to be maintained and reconstructed. CB8 requests additional safety ehancements such as auditory pedestrian signals. We advocate for funding to resurface West Kingsbridge Road.  ","Due to our northern location, transportation and access is very important to our community. We have advocated for restoration to the Bx20 Bus service for many years. Our board advocayes for increased service for Access-a-Ride for older adults with disabilities within CB8 because of its particularly hilly topography. In addition to an increase in transit services, CB8 requested security cameras at subway stations and happy to hear this has been funded.  ","","","","","Park care and maintenance","","Bronx Community Board 8 is home to at least sixty- eight parks and open green spaces.  Our residents deeply value and use our parks and playgrounds heavily. Use of our parks increased significantly since the beginning of the pandemic in 2020. 87.0% of residents live within walking distance of a park or open space. However, lack of maintenance and increased need for PEP officers to enforce park rules remain a serious concern.   Bronx Community Board 8 urges the city redesign and reconstruct Bailey Playground in Kingsbridge. It is important to reduce paving and introduce green space, update equipment, and repair deteriorated drains.  Bronx Community Board 8 recommends incorporating adjacent Tibbetts Tail into Bailey Park. If this project gets done, it will expand the park and create an equitable playground for nearby residents and create a greenspace where it is lacking.    CB8 requests an increase in personnel to help alleviate illegal use of electric bikes, ATVS, illegal BBQ's, parties and double parking. Park rules and regulations need to be enforced.  Van Cortlandt Park is the third largest park in New York City, with nearly 1,200 acres of public space that is used by nearly 3 million visitors each year. It is considered a destination park.  CB8 supports an increase in funding for equipment for Van Cortlandt Park such as a mini packer to deal with the growing trash problem and a gator to help with landscape management and operations of the park. For years we have advocated for the renovation of the Van Cortlandt Park stadium, W 251st Street restrooms, and the restoration of the mansion’s exterior brick stairway.   We also request new equipment to help with the maintenance and operation of our district's parks and green spaces such as Two Large Packer Garbage Trucks, Crew Cab Pickup and a Deere tractor with cutting unit. It is almost impossible to maintain parks without these essential vehicles. These are the bare essentials needed to upkeep our parks.   One of our most valuable community institutions, Kingsbridge Heights Community Center (KHCC), may possibly face imminent closure, displacing its programs, which serve 1500 residents weekly by providing essential services to expectant mothers, infants, children, youth, and families. KHCC is located in a landmarked building at 3101 Kingsbridge Terrace. The building is severely compromised by deteriorated mortar and damaged flashing, which is causing leaks that are damaging walls and ceilings. Prior to the pandemic, funding was in place to address these conditions through a combination of City funding  and non-City funding. The damage has recently worsened and there is now an unfunded gap of $1.5 million. The building is owned by the Department of Parks & Recreation but they do  have a capital projects budget. If the additional funding cannot be quickly secured, the building may be forced to close, displacing staff and the many residents who use the building for its programs.","CB 8 is home to at least 68 parks and open greenspaces.

In total the district covers 4.1 square miles in which nearly 200,000 people reside. Inland, the community consists of a range of residential building types and commercial uses. Single-family detached and 1-2 family row houses are common throughout the district (1 in 5 of all lots). Clustered within a southwest pocket are 9 large NYC Public Housing Authority complexes. The neighborhood to the north of the Bruckner Expressway consists of a mixture of housing types ranging from single family detached homes to a 129 acre Parkchester community built in 1941.

Our community anxiously awaits the construction of the Parkchester Train Station elevator for the 6 line and continues to advocate for bus service that allows easy transfers to local train stations with elevator access as well as more frequent bus service. ","Community Board 9 has the largest district in The Bronx with nearly 200,000 residents and geographically 5 square miles. The most congested corridor, the Cross Bronx Expressway in located in our CB. In Addition, other major arteries such as the Sheridan Expressway, Bruckner Expressway, Bronx River Parkway and Hutch Parkway contribute to thousands of vehicles utilizing our district, thus effecting our traffic and transportation infrastructure.","Bronx Community Board 9 residents rely heavily on public transportation, and providing high-quality transit services will connect residents with needed opportunities.  According to the 2013 5-year American Community Survey, 62.3% of CB9 residents primarily use public transit services to get to work.  This is higher than the city average of 55.9%.  Additionally, the commute time for the working population is longer than the city average, 44.7 minutes compared to 39.2.               At the same time, CB9 faces higher poverty and unemployment rates compared to the city as a whole.  The poverty rate in the district is 28.4% compared to the city average of 20.3%.  The unemployment rate is 13.5% compared to the city average of 10.6%.  To address this discrepancy, better transit services are needed to connect residents with job opportunities both within and outside of the district.               Finally, better transit services are needed to serve residents with disabilities.  11.9% of the district’s population has a disability, compared to 10.3% in NYC, and many of these residents may rely on public transportation for commutes and other traveling needs.  Combined with the senior population and those approaching senior status, there is a significant portion of the population that requires high-quality transit service to meet basic needs.","","","","","Community board resources (offices, staff, and equipment)","","Pressing Issue selected is based on survey responses collected from CB9 Board Members.

The Board serves the communities of Pelham Bay, City Island, Country Club, Throggs Neck, Co-op City, Westchester Square and Zerega. It features one of the most diverse housing categories in the City. It primarily consists of 1-3 family homes. However, it is home to the largest housing cooperative in New York State in Co-op City and is home to a sizable public housing stock in that of Middletown Plaza, Throggs Neck Houses and Randall-Balcom Houses. Bronx Community Board #10 is a district surrounded by the following water bodies: Eastchester Bay, Long Island Sound and the East River. These bodies of water highlight the need for storm resiliency measures that will protect our communities from tidal surges that are expected to come from major storms. As proper stewards for the Board's service areas, we at Bronx CB #10 took it upon ourselves to conduct an examination of the Board's storm surge defenses.The research yielded recommendations such as earth berms, rock jetties and sea walls control coastal flooding from the storms. The Board further felt that the storm sewers should be examined district-wide as well. High functioning and adequately sized sewers are needed for the water to drain off. The Board is interested in seeing DEP and DOT develop joint projects for these purposes. Bronx Community Board #10 is experiencing population growth in nearly all of its neighborhoods. It is crucial that the City continue to renovate our parks, increase recreational programming for children and seniors, increase school seats, refurbish and maintain our roads and sidewalks, further commit to the livelihood of our small businesses through business improvement district formation and repair our public housing stock so that our most vulnerable are protected. With population growth comes further strains on our public resources such as mass transit. Bronx Community Board #10 residents experience one of the longest subway rides to Manhattan according to New York University. With this in mind, it is crucial for the City of New York to study ways to take advantage of our largely unused waterways for possible ferry service and to find ways to expand bus service throughout all of Co-op City and City Island. Bronx Community Board #10 stands ready to support measures that will go toward enhancing the quality-of-life our residents. The City should take the ensuing priorities as the start of a much larger endeavor to plan the future of Bronx Community Board #10 in a way that enhances quality-of-life and ensures that the Board's service areas are seeing the resources it needs. ","","","","","Land use trends","","Lower Growth Management Area designations are unique zoning protections given to us by the City of New York Department of City Planning. Our communities have little reliable transit. We maintain some of the highest rates of car ownership in the City of New York. The Department of City Planning's current initiatives of citywide zoning text amendments are a backdoor way of imposing a one-size-fits-all policy. We ask that the Department of City Planning acknowledge the realities of communities that have Lower Growth Management Area designations and work to complement the designated areas. ","Quality of life issues (noise, graffiti, petty crime, etc.)","","Our communities are currently experiencing increases in grand larceny auto, retail theft and burglary and not enough enforcement of smoke shops that are selling cannabis illegally. Nearly all of our schools need more traffic agents and crossing guards to help protect pedestrians. We continue to see increases in illegal dumping along our highway service roads. Since 2020, commercial vehicles of all sizes are parking on our residential streets and highway service roads with no tangible enforcement to discourage such behavior. ","Street flooding","","Street flooding remains a pervasive issue in communities such as City Island, Locust Point and Edgewater Park. To name a few, Tier Street, Minnieford Avenue and Ditmars Street need curbs and storm drains. Basement flooding is a norm in our communities. Our communities could benefit from better infrastructure such as rain gardens, improved storm drains, and capital projects that include curb installation.","","","","","Access to healthy food and lifestyle programs","","We have little to no lifestyle programming in Bronx Community Board 10. We have little to no access to healthy food. The City of New York must help deliver farmers markets to our communities. We want more programing tackling smoking and obesity. We have many public school buildings that can help foster programming and education on these topics. ","Bronx residents continue to seek medical care in emergency rooms. Our communities are served by Einstein Hospital and Jacobi Hospital. Both need expansions of its emergency rooms, particuarly at Einstein Hospital, where patients waits hours and, sometimes days, to receive a bed. The City of New York must execute a media and digital media campaign to encourage New Yorkers to seek care at Urgent Cares or with a patient's primary care doctor.  ","According to City Planning, Bronx Community Board #10's is home to a sizeable aging population. Co-op City is a Naturally Occurring Retirement Communnity, or NORC. With this in mind, Bronx Community Board #10 asks that the City, through DFTA and its corresponding senior centers, invest in more case management and transportation services for seniors. The City of New York My Ride program offered by the Department for the Aging was successful and popular. The program must return.  ","Bronx Community Board #10 is located in the northeast Bronx.  Its business services are concentrated in several commercial  areas: E. Tremont Avenue, Crosby Avenue, Westchester Square, Bartow Avenue and City Island Avenue. DHS placed a shelter for 95 women and children in a former hotel, on the outskirts of our Board area. It has no laundry facilities on site, so the women must take two buses to reach the nearest laundry mat.  There are no cooking facilities (microwaves in the rooms) flouting the requirements of the Comptroller's Memorandum governing Emergency Contracts that states such facilities must be located in rooms where women with children or pregnant women are domiciled. There is anecdotal evidence from the community at large, that the meals offered to the clients at the shelter are unappetizing and that they are often discarded. One of the contractual goals of the shelter operators is to provide the clients with opportunities for job training. employment and enhanced social services. Bronx Community Board #10 is home to three City of New York-operated shelters. We ask that the City bear in mind that under the Fair Share Criteria, Bronx Community Board #10 has met its requirement.","Our low-income New Yorkers need help in their own communities. Our Board Office benefits from having a  NYCHRA liaison help New Yorkers to access benefits and resources. We request the same from DFTA to help older New Yorkers.  ","","","","","Other - Write In (Required)","","Our public school buildings still have no air conditoning. After school programs are administered by lottery. Parents and guardians request for more 3PK and UPK facilities in our district. These are some of many requests that our communities ask of us. We must expand after school programing to any child that needs one. We must expand beacon programming. We must equip our schools with air conditioning and 21st Century technologies. ","Literacy rates fell during the pandemic. All of our public schools should be equipped with a library and librarian. We ask that the Department of Education find space immediately to accomodate a library within our classrooms.  ","No comments","","","","","General crime","","The work of our 45th Precinct is stellar. However, the precinct is consistently under-resourced. Our precinct is currently down in 20 officers in headcount. We are experiencing more illegal commercial parking. Our convenience stores experience retail theft daily. Grand theft larceny has increased 83% since 2021. Our precinct deserves its fair share of resources to combat these quality-of-life issues and potentially violent crimes. ","The entirety of the 45th Precinct is surrounded by highways. We have unique challenges because of it. We are experiencing an increase in crimes in nearly every category. Because we are the largest geographic precinct and community district, we need more neighborhood coordination officers and more targeted foot patrol. We request more targeted enforcment of bad-acting smoke shops and illegal parking.  ","Emergency services are crucial components to the livelihood of a community. We ask that the FDNY, along with the NYPD, report to the Board in writing that any location service apparatus being used is accurate. For example, the community of Edgewater Park is often misidentified. The City should work with the Board immediately on this issue.","","","","","Preparedness for extreme weather events (incl. coastal flooding, heat waves, cold snaps, heavy wind and rain)","","Almost all of Bronx Community Board #10 communities are bounded by the East River, Long Island Sound and Eastchester Bay.  During Hurricane Sandy several of our communities, most notably City Island and Edgewater Park, were severely damaged.  Had the wind not changed course, the damage to our Community Board's waterfront communities would have been devastating.  The Board is interested in seeing the protective systems installed that will serve as breaks to storm surges.  Additionally,  the Board would like to see the sewers assessed to determine if they are sized correctly to handle the very large storm flow that will come onto the land.","Bronx Community Board #10 would like to see a joint DEP/DOT program to survey our areas and install sea walls and catch basins. Neighborhoods like City Island would experience flooding on streets like Tier, Bay, Fordham, Hawkins, Carroll, Centre, Winter, Early, Pell, Reynolds, Pilot, Marine, Buckley, Horton, Schofield, Rochelle, Beach, Kilroe, Sutherland and Terrace Streets; King Avenue and Fordham Place are inadequately protected. In Edgewater Park, which has a sea wall, 1st, 2nd and 4th Avenue, Pennyfield Avenue and Soundview Drive are vulnerable; Silver Beach, which also has a sea wall, is also prone to flooding. Acorn, Beach, Ceder, Daisy, Elm, Fern, Geranium, and Hazel Streets, Ivy, Jasmine, Edgar, Dare, Casler, Bevy, Alan, Schuyler Places, Indian Terrace, and the campus of SUNY Maritime College, are all prone to flooding. Within Locust Point, Locust Point Avenue, Tierney Place, Longstreet Avenue and Hatting Avenue, the Hammond Cove and Locust Point Marina area, and Calhoun and Schurz Avenues in Throggs Neck will be badly affected, as well as Clarence and Randall Avenues and Country Club. The end of Lafayette Avenue in Ferry Point and all of Ferry Point Park will be flooded. The Board would like to see that both agencies develop a plan to stop the storm water surges and to provide a sewer system that will be able to handle them. ","Bronx Community Board #10 enjoys one of the highest rates of recycling in the City.  Co-op City, the largest housing cooperative in the State recycles and processes its own waste and we are still limited to one day a week pick up.  For several years, the Board has been requesting an additional day for pickup.  We believe that we have proven our commitment to the City's recycling goals and therefore, request another day.","","","","","Land use and zoning","","The City of New York designated Bronx Community Board 10 as a Lower Growth Management Area. The Community Board will continue to oppose any citywide text amendment, rezoning whether public or private, that undoes the protections the City of New York afforded to us. Additionally, the conditions at Throggs Neck Houses are disgraceful. Elevators flood. Sidewalks are cracked, broken and impassable. Tenants' units have gaping holes, inadequate heat and unsanitary conditions. The City of New York is the worst landlord in our city and should gets its own house in order.","Our land use differs from many parts of the city. Our zoning protects side yard and parking requirements. We will defend any changes to our zoning vigorously. We will oppose any topdown citywide text amendment approach that does not complement our Lower Growth Management Area designation. Housing development may rightfully occur where it complies with and satifies current zoning.  ","We ask that the City of New York remove any and all lead in the Throggs Neck Houses apartments. We ask that the City provide adequate heat and hot water through the winter months. Bronx Community Board #10 received complaints on both matters. We stand ready to assist in identifying residents that are in danger and how the City can improve their living space in an expeditious manner.","No comments","","","","","Traffic congestion","","Traffic congestion worsened because of programs and initiatives that have taken away parking lanes and spaces from the public. These initiatives are e-scooters, outdoor dining and carshare to name a few. Little to no enforcement is done to encourage e-scooter rides to ride on the street. NYCDOT installed four-to-three conversions throughout Throggs Neck which have done little to curb speeding. The Community Board office has requested study after study for traffic calming measures only to be met with NYCDOT's denial. Traffic enforcement is lacking in our community. ","The Board seeks several capital reconstruction projects and light surveys. ","Because of a lack of subway network, bus service is crucial to Bronx Community Board #10. In years past,  we have requested expanded service in Co-op City and City Island and a long East Tremont Avenue via the BX 40 and BX 42 routes. Bus service, according to many media outlets and think tanks, has slowed in New York City while ridership has decreased. It is crucial we look toward ways to improve bus service and expand in areas where there is no NYCT footprint.","","","","","Quality of parks and park facilities","","The NYC Parks Department is grossly underfunded. Bronx Community Board #10 wishes to see area parks repaired and updated. Enhancing the experience at our parks goes a long way toward fostering community development and improving our quality-of-life. Pelham Bay Park is the largest park in New York City. Bronx Community Board #10 requests that the city hire the appropriate amount of staffing in its horticulture unit at Pelham Bay Park, fully invest in the Orchard Beach Pavilion and Bath House. In addition, we ask that the City fully fund the tree and sidewalks program, enhance funding for tree pruning and hire more Parks Enforcement Patrol personnel.","Community Board #10 has several playgrounds and parks in desperate need of renovation. We ask that the Parks Department provide cost estimates for each park listed in this statement.  ","No comments","The Westchester Square Library is scheduled for a new building. It is an innovative design that the Board supports and the community welcomes. Funding is in place and the Board looks forward to its construction. The Board expects that the library will be a state of the art facility that will offer innovative and popular programs.The Board is home to several other fine libraries and we have always advocated for their funding. It is hoped that they will receive the needed resources to carry on its great work. ","","","","","","Explanation","","","","","","","","","","BX10","","","","","","","","","","",""

Currently, it's led by a dedicated membership of 44 volunteers and paid staff.[i] The board's focus is broad; overseeing varying topics, and issues on matters of: parks, land use, rezoning, transportation/mobility, core infrastructure, city services, health, youth and education, civic engagement, public safety/emergency services, on-premise consumption liquor license applications, cannabis license/permit applications and more.  Additionally, the board works in collaboration with agencies and local elected officials to ensure the delivery of much-needed services to its community.  BxCB11 is home to a vast amount of beautiful parks, greenery, greenways, and landscapes that lend to the allure and richness of our borough and district.  One of our most pressing community issues has been the survival of our parklands.  There is a strong community voice and appeal to the need for new and restorative infrastructure, steady/solid park maintenance for pest control, trash/waste removal, adequate receptacles, park enforcement/regulations, and security.  Because BxCB11 is synonymous with its parks, with 73% of its residents (22.6 % under the age of 18 and 14.2% over the age of 65) living within walking distance of 19 parks or open spaces.  Encompassing a total of 2,303 acres or 14% of parkland within BxDistrict 11, the community has faced an overwhelming challenge in keeping its parks' environmental integrity intact due to an onslaught of multiple factors, which has proven to be a top priority.   From the years 2010 to 2020, the total population in BxCB11 grew from 113,232 to 119,666, according to the United States Census. That is a 5.7 percent increase.  With the growing influx, street parking has become scarce, causing residents to circle their blocks for 45+ minutes in search of adequate parking space.  In 2022, presumably due to this fact, a redesign in BxDistrict 11 called the Bronxdale Road Diet was introduced which has caused pedestrian, bicyclist, and e-scooter riders and traffic confusion and/or congestion with numerous unfortunate, even fatal accidents.  The community has voiced the need for multilevel parking amenities, and the reconsideration of not having rental car services take over the already limited community parking spaces.  With the impending proposed Metro-North stations coming to the Bronx and specifically, district 11 at Van Nest and Morris Park, community concerns are that the current parking dilemma will exacerbate the issue.  Infrastructure is also a top priority, as transportation has increased so have the deterioration of road conditions, potholes, flooding, and puddles/mud incursions.   Youth, education, and child welfare have been top priorities in BxDistrict 11 and remain so.  With a population of almost 120K, and only 32 public schools and 3 libraries in the area, the youth and families of BxDistrict 11 have been challenged with varying social drivers of health issues.  As stated in the community snapshot of key indicators, 22.6 % of Bronx District 11 is comprised of youth under the age of 18 with families experiencing an income of 20% below the NYCgov poverty threshold as compared to the federal poverty rate, and 49.4% paying 35% of that income to rent.  Additionally, 24% of residents over 25 years or older earned a bachelor's degree or higher.  The overcrowding and/or closing of schools, lack of equity for technology, and learning to basic school materials have not served to foster success in our district youth.  The lack of functional parks grounds for adequate programming, such as sports, camps, and environmental learning to the absence of a recreational/community center and FREE programming for cultural richness and expression such as dance, college readiness, ESL (23.7% of the district self-identify as having limited English proficiency) are catalyst to district growth.  The need for support in generational health and readiness such as antiviolence and drugs will also serve to foster comradery and social development, and some much more.   For more information about Bronx Community Board 11, visit: https://www1.nyc.gov/site/bronxcb11/about/about.page ","","","","","Parks and open space","","BxCB11 is home to a vast amount of beautiful parks, greenery, greenways, and landscapes that lend to the allure and richness of our borough and district.  One of our most pressing community issues has been the survival of our parklands.  There is a strong community voice and appeal to the need for new and restorative infrastructure, steady/solid park maintenance for pest control, trash/waste removal, adequate receptacles, park enforcement/regulations, and security.  Because Bronx CB11 is synonymous with its parks, with 73% of its residents (22.6 % under the age of 18 and 14.2% over the age of 65) living within walking distance of 19 parks or open spaces.  Encompassing a total of 2,303 acres or 14% of parkland within BxDistrict 11, the community has faced an overwhelming challenge in keeping its parks’ environmental integrity intact due to an onslaught of multiple factors, which has proven to be a top priority.   ","Schools","","Youth, education, and child welfare have been top priorities in BxDistrict 11 and remain so.  With a population of almost 120K, and only 32 public schools and 3 libraries in the area, the youth and families of BxDistrict 11 have been challenged with varying social drivers of health issues.  As stated in the community snapshot of key indicators, 22.6 % of Bronx District 11 is comprised of youth under the age of 18 with families experiencing an income of 20% below the NYCgov poverty threshold as compared to the federal poverty rate, and 49.4% paying 35% of that income to rent.  Additionally, 24% of residents over 25 years or older earned a bachelor’s degree or higher.  The overcrowding and/or closing of schools, lack of equity for technology, and learning to basic school materials have not served to foster success in our district youth.  The lack of functional parks grounds for adequate programming, such as sports, camps, and environmental learning to the absence of a recreational/community center and FREE programming for cultural richness and expression such as dance, college readiness, ESL (23.7% of the district self-identify as having limited English proficiency) are catalyst to district growth.  The need for support in generational health and readiness such as antiviolence and drugs will also serve to foster comradery and social development, and some much more. ","Traffic","","From the years 2010 to 2020, the total population in BxCB11 grew from 113,232 to 119,666, according to the United States Census. That is a 5.7 percent increase.  With the growing influx, street parking has become scarce, causing residents to circle their blocks for 45+ minutes in search of adequate parking space.  In 2022, presumably due to this fact, a redesign in BxDistrict 11 called the Bronxdale Road Diet was introduced which has caused pedestrian, bicyclist, and e-scooter riders and traffic confusion and/or congestion with numerous unfortunate, even fatal accidents.  The community has voiced the need for multilevel parking amenities, and the reconsideration of not having rental car services take over the already limited community parking spaces.  With the impending proposed Metro-North stations coming to the Bronx and specifically, district 11 at Van Nest and Morris Park, community concerns are that the current parking dilemma will exacerbate the issue.  Infrastructure is also a top priority, as transportation has increased so have the deterioration of road conditions, potholes, flooding, and puddles/mud incursions.  ","","","","","Access to healthy food and lifestyle programs","","We are seeking funding for a targeted initiative focused on improving access to healthy food options and lifestyle programs within Community Board 11. This proposal outlines a strategic allocation of resources to address the unique challenges faced by our community. Specifically, we aim to establish local farmers' markets, community gardens, and forge partnerships with grocers to ensure a consistent supply of fresh and nutritious food. Additionally, funds are needed for nutrition education and outreach programs, empowering our residents with the knowledge and skills required to make informed dietary choices. By prioritizing physical activity and wellness programs, we aim to promote an active and healthy lifestyle that complements our efforts to enhance food accessibility. Collaborative partnerships with local organizations, healthcare providers, and community leaders will amplify the impact of these initiatives. This investment will lead to a healthier, more vibrant Community Board 11, where residents have the resources and support to lead fulfilling and healthy lives. Your consideration of this budget request is greatly appreciated.","With so many new buildings erected, estimated dozen within a 10 square block radius, a data study is requested to inform the community of the actual number of cars and number of school-aged children in the area.

Additionally, resources will be allocated for the training and deployment of additional law enforcement personnel in high-impact areas. This budget request aims to fortify partnerships with local law enforcement agencies, community organizations, and educational institutions to create a unified front against criminal activity.

Additionally, an evaluation of school-aged children in the area is imperative, given a reported 20% rise in school enrollments over the past two years. Furthermore, gathering qualitative feedback from residents on concerns about traffic congestion, access to amenities, and overall satisfaction with the evolving landscape is essential. This study will provide a foundation for informed decisions on infrastructure, traffic management, and educational resource allocation, ultimately contributing to the continued prosperity of Bronx Community Board 11.

","","","","","Affordable housing creation","","The need for affordable housing in our community is more pressing than ever, with demand surpassing availability. Recent data indicates a significant disparity between the Area Median Income (AMI) and the actual income of many residents. To address this issue, we propose a multifaceted approach that includes the creation of affordable housing units and the reform of AMI calculations. By reallocating resources towards the development of affordable housing, we aim to bridge the gap between income levels and housing costs, ensuring that all community members have access to safe and stable housing. Simultaneously, advocating for AMI reform will lead to more accurate assessments of income levels, thereby enabling a more equitable distribution of affordable housing resources.

Recent assessments have identified the need for significant improvements, particularly at Zimmerman playground. This proposal outlines a comprehensive plan that encompasses park renovations, with special emphasis on upgrading the restroom facilities at Zimmerman playground. By allocating resources towards these vital upgrades, we aim to create safe, accessible, and inviting spaces for recreation and leisure activities. Additionally, these improvements will enhance community engagement and foster a sense of pride in our local parks.

Dogs must leave the run to access the water source/fountain.  This lack of immediate access to the canines playing in the park has caused heat exhaustion to various dogs over the years.  The water source outside of the dog park is not convenient and the design must be reconsidered fixed, especially during the hot days in the summer when the animals overheat.  Animals should have access within the dog run.  We are asking for parks to support this funding requesting and to advocate on behalf of the community to our local elected officials.

Whether it involves solving a difficulty arising between local residents, rectifying a problem relative to the delivery of government services, or just lending an open and understanding ear to one who is looking to be heard, it is a blessing to get to know people and have the opportunity to work on their behalf. These sentiments are shared, we know, by all who work at our Town Hall Headquarters. Over our many years of service at Town Hall, we have strived to make local government effective and truly accessible to neighborhood citizens. The ongoing refurbishment and renovation of Town Hall and of our Carriage House, with the aid and the support of our elected officials, is a significant accomplishment in this regard. Important as well are our engagement in innumerable meetings, frequent telephone calls, and copious correspondence that cause the hours of a typical day at the Community Board to fly by so quickly. Our objective is to keep in touch with our community and to make them aware of how much we value hearing from them. Community Board 12 is composed of several distinct neighborhoods, each one unique and vibrant in its own way. Community Board 12 is an extremely diverse community welcoming both newly arrived Irish immigrants into Woodlawn and West Indian immigrants into Baychester. This rich diversity of cultures makes Community Board 12 a desirable community. Baychester is located in the eastern part of the district, consists of low and flat land that used to be marshland and valleys. Its boundaries are East 222nd Street to the north, Pelham Parkway to the south and Bronxwood Avenue to the west. Eastchester Road is the main commercial thoroughfare. The local subway is the IRT Dyre Avenue number 5 line. Eastchester covers roughly half a square mile. Its boundaries are the Bronx-Westchester County border to the north, the New England thruway to the east, Baychester Avenue to the south, and the intersection of East 233 Street and Baychester Avenue to the west. Boston Road is the primary thoroughfare, and Dyre Avenue is the main commercial strip. The neighborhood includes an industrial district and one New York City Housing Authority development, Boston Sector Houses. It is also home to Seton Falls Park, known as the ""Grand Canyon"" of the Bronx. Situated on more than 30 acres of land, this nature preserve offers a respite from its urban surroundings with a waterside walking trail, a manmade waterfall, and a bird sanctuary. Also boasting several playgrounds, Seton Falls Park offers recreation options for the whole family. Edenwald is located north of Baychester, south of Wakefield, east of Bronxwood Avenue, and west of Boston Post Road. It is home to the 47th precinct of the New York City Police Department, and to two NYCHA public developments, Baychester Houses and Edenwald Houses. Fishbay is a small, quaint neighborhood which covers approximately one-fifth of a square mile, and has a population of just under 8,000. The community is bounded by Laconia Ave. to the west and Boston Road to the east. Haffen Park, at the intersection of Gunther and Burke Avenues, has frequently been praised as a ""kid-friendly playground"" and has a pool. Olinville is today considered part of the Williamsbridge neighborhood, and shares the 10467 zip code. It is situated west of White Plains Road between Allerton Avenue and Gun Hill Road, and is served by the IRT White Plains Road number 2 and 5 subway lines. Wakefield was once woods and farmland like the rest of the northern Bronx. The boundaries of the 1.3 square mile neighborhood are the Westchester County border at East 243rd Street the north, East 222nd Street to the south, and the Bronx River, the Bronx River Parkway and the Metro-North Railroad tracks to the west. Wakefield is home to a number of parks, the most popular of which is Shoelace Park, the northern section of Bronx Park. Shoelace Park hugs the banks of the Bronx River, and includes a kayak launch at East 219th Street. The neighborhood, is served by the IRT White Plains Road number 2 and 5 subway lines, MetroNorth's Harlem Line, and the BxM11 express bus line. White Plains Road is the main shopping district, popular for its many fresh produce markets and Spanish, West Indian, and East Indian specialty food shops. Williamsbridge is located in the northeast section of the Bronx, and covers roughly a mile and a half. Its boundaries are East 222 Street to the north, Boston Road to the east, East Gun Hill Road to the south, and the Bronx River to the west. White Plains Road is the primary thoroughfare of Williamsbridge. The local subways are the IRT White Plains Road number 2 and 5 lines, and MetroNorth's Harlem Line also provides service to the neighborhood. Woodlawn is at the very north end of the Bronx. Its boundaries are McLean Avenue to the north -- which is also the New York/Westchester County Line -- the Bronx River to the east, Woodlawn Cemetery to the south, and Van Cortlandt Park to the west. The main commercial thoroughfare is Katonah Avenue, which runs north-south through the heart of Woodlawn, and is a popular destination for its many fine restaurants and specialty shops. Woodlawn Cemetery is known as the resting place of many of history's greats and has been designated a National Historic Landmark. ","","","","","Parks and open space","","BxCB12 is requesting more resources for the Parks Department to deal with the many complaints we receive regarding trees.  Our Parks can always be made better, but our request would direct monies to maintenance; specifically street tree maintenance.  Our Community Board is besieged by phone calls from residents concerned about street trees.  Our complaints range from requests for tree pruning to the removal of dead trees or branches that constituents worry will do them harm or their properties.  It is our understanding after discussing many of our concerns with the Parks Department that they do not have the monies necessary to increase routine maintenance.  It is our understanding that the tree pruning program is now done on a seven-year rotation.  We would like that time frame shortened to a three-year rotation as it used to be many years ago.  Additionally, we understand that there is no budget for stump removal.  Tree stumps are only removed when a new tree is being planted in its place.  The concern is that tree stumps can remain for several years before being addressed.  Moreover, the Parks Department implemented a rating system used to assess the risk a dangerous tree poses to the public.  Similarly, they also have a system to assess sidewalks damaged by tree roots.  Both systems assign a rating and the Parks Department fixes the worst rated trees and sidewalks.  The concern is that the program runs out of money before they can get to all the damaged trees or sidewalks.  The request would be for the administration to adequately fund these programs to zero out the pool of damaged sidewalks and trees.    ","Quality of life issues (noise, graffiti, petty crime, etc.)","","Like most communities our biggest complaints come in a variety of Quality of Life concerns aimed at neighbor to neighbor noise complaints, street cleaning, parking and public safety.  Some of these issues we address by asking agencies for specific items like asking the NYPD to equip each patrol car with a sound meter to appropriately deal with noise complaints.  It is our understanding that while the NYPD responds to these types of complaints enforcement is very rare since each precinct is only outfitted with one noise meter.  Moreover, there is usually a limited number of officers that are trained properly to use it.  Another concern regarding the NYPD is the enforcement of speeding.  Our Board has a large number of requests before DOT for speed reducers called speed humps.  It can take up to two years for DOT to study the request for a speed hump due to backlog of request.  While speed humps are installed to slow vehicles down it is not a failsafe and we need more enforcement from the NYPD.  The last issue we need more help on is the illegal truck parking on our streets.  We understand parking can be a sensitive issue for many but we have tractor trailers parking on our residential streets.  We work very closely with the Precinct to conduct tow efforts but the NYPD limits what they can do monthly.  We need a coordinated and sustained effort to get these trucks off our streets.  These trucks can be seen parked near our schools cutting off visibility when children are crossing the street.  Additionally, many of these trucks are carrying municipal waste which poses other problems with the stench it creates attracting rodents and wildlife.  We need the NYPD to invest Finally, another concern for BxCB12 is the cleanliness of our district but I will deal with that in our next bullet.   in more heavy tow vehicles to deal with this ongoing problem.    ","Trash removal and cleanliness","","The cleanliness of our commercial districts is a major Quality of Life concern for Community Board.  Our commercial businesses on White Plains Road, Dyre Avenue, Boston Road, East 233rd Street, Webster Avenue and East Gun Hill Road must do a better job of keeping their sidewalks and streets clean.  We have asked the Department of Sanitation to step up their enforcement efforts in addition to asking for more liter basket pick-ups.  Our elected officials have been very helpful in trying to address our concerns.  Assembly Member Carl Heastie is funding the Doe Fund to keep White Plains Road clean.  We need more of these types of clean-up initiatives to keep these corridors clear of debris especially on the weekends.   ","","","","","Services to reduce or prevent homelessness","","Our concern is not with services for the homeless but rather the siting of these facilities in communities like ours.  The Department of Social Services (DHS/HRA) has not been forthright with our Board regarding these facilities.  The previous administration released Turning the Tide to address homelessness and a plan to site 90 new shelter facilities in a more equitable manner.  We view this statement and goal as being at odds with itself.  The Bloomberg administration, in an effort to curb homelessness, greatly expanded the Cluster Site program in the Bronx.  In other boroughs, there was a combination of using hotels as transient housing for homeless individuals.  The current administration no longer publishes the Turning the Tide Map on its website that indicated the placement of these facilities throughout the City.  Our concern is the leadership of DHS continues to be less than forthright on the placement of these sites.  Like the previous administration the Adam's administration has not been honest in their dealings with local communities in the Bronx.   The Bronx continues to shoulder the burden of housing homeless individuals.  Moreover, the Bronx has the most permanent shelters built under the ""Master Lease Program."" Community Boards are not often notified in a timely manner.  In the last year, the Department of Homeless Services, the Office of Emergency Management, and the Department of Housing and Preservation have opened 10 shelters, including migrant shelters.  There is no standard approach to the siting of these facilities.  The Wakefield community is a small, tight vibrant community that was overwhelmed with five shelters in three months.        This strategy burdens communities already saddled with clusters sites.  I use this terminology loosely to say this strategy also employs private 1-2 family homes in my district and converts them into illegal Single Room Occupancy housing using City monies to house homeless individuals.  My Community Board was never given notification on the siting of these SRO's or where the cluster sites were located before turning them into permanent housing for homeless people.  This Board and the Bronx has done its Fair Share.   It is high time that the rest of the City do what is required and shoulder the burden of homelessness equitable.  It is incumbent upon this administration to be forthright with its citizens and engage all communities to do their fair share.  The current trajectory is unsustainable and has already brought resentment towards immigrants looking for the American dream.                    ","No comments","No comments","There are 59 Community Boards in the City of New York and there more than a dozen that will never deal with the siting of a homeless facility within its neighborhoods.  Equitably this is unfair and goes against what this administration said it would do.  In the last eight years this administration sought to add three new shelters within the borders of BxCB12; increasing the total number of shelters within our community.       ","No comments","","","","","Youth workforce development and summer youth employment","","Increased funding is needed for the SYEP program to meet the demand of the youth that apply for these jobs.  Summer jobs are a primary and effective means in developing skills in our youth.  We encourage DYCD and the City to find meaningful internships that take advantage of New York City's stature as the greatest City on Earth.  The City is the media capital of the world in addition to Wall Street, high-end law firms and any number of unique small businesses.  The City should partner with these firms to target all children that might not otherwise get a foot in the door.  Recent gains in the number of SYEP jobs is great but barely addresses the need.  we must continue to do better.  ","No comments","No comments","","","","","Traffic violations and enforcement","","We need better enforcement of speeding laws.  Community Board 12 has been littered with speed cameras and safety corridors.  Yet with all these safety measures put in place residents still complain of vehicles speeding in the district.  Residents of BxCB12 requests Speed Humps in order to reduce this public nuisance.  DOT cannot keep up with the demand in the Bronx.  It takes two years for a request to be approved.  We would not have to go through this if the NYPD enforced the speeding laws.","No comments","No comments","","","","","Preparedness for extreme weather events (incl. coastal flooding, heat waves, cold snaps, heavy wind and rain)","","In the last several years BxCB12 has experienced an increase in the number of flooding complaints.  These rain events are impacting neighborhoods like BxCB12 that did not see these types of flooding situations.  It is our understanding that these rain events will only increase in frequency.  DEP needs to look at the current infrastructure to see if it is adequate to handle these rain events.          ","No comments","No comments","","","","","Commercial district revitalization","","CB12 has several commercial districts with many vacant storefronts.  Moreover, there is no diversification of the types of services in those storefronts that are occupied.  Many of our retail establishments are of the food services type; restaurants or convenience stores.  We would like to see more offerings from retailers.  Considering the number of national retailers leaving Manhattan zip codes because of the high rents we would suggest EDC or SBS create a strategy to encourage these retailers to move to districts like the Bronx.  The rents are cheaper and people who shop there live in these neighborhoods rather than living in Manhattan.  With the Work From Home becoming more of a fixture in our everyday lives it would behoove the City to encourage these retailers to move to where the people live.

Parks needs an increase in funding that this administration promised before getting into office, 1% for Parks.   Irreparable harm would be done if the Parks Department were not allowed to maintain the Parks in our Borough due to insufficient funds.  Many of our Parks are new and need constant care for upkeep.

It is our hope that the items identified in this document will be given priority consideration by the City of New York  in order further to enhance the development of a cooperative planning process and ensure an improvement in the quality of life for all of our residents. We recognize the importance of working with the city council, community agencies, and the Mayor's office to address our district's needs. Our top three priorities are Affordable housing, Parks and Open Space, and Transportation and Mobility.  We support the effort to fund affordable development and implement programs to meet the many needs of our residents. We urge that sufficient funding be provided for the Department of Parks and Recreation to meet these needs for more green and open spaces.  Our streets are congested with traffic, causing excessive wear and tear on the roadways. Additionally, our public transportation system requires upgrades. ","","","","","Affordable Housing","","Affordable Housing - Affordable Housing in Community Board No. 1 is a top priority that must be addressed as a critical need.  lack of affordable housing options remains the most significant concern to Brooklyn Community Board One. We are skeptical that the 2005 rezoning has produced the number of projected affordable units. While we have seen plenty of higher-end luxury housing created in our district, sadly, those units are out of reach for many residents of North Brooklyn. And when MIH units are included in a new development, the affordable rents still tend to be set too high for many of the neediest residents to access. There is a severe need for affordable senior housing and larger units with multiple bedrooms for families. Both of these continue to be urgently needed in our district. We look forward to analyzing the City of Yes for Housing Opportunity proposal over the coming year.","Infrastructure resiliency","","Transportation and Infrastructure in Community Board No. 1 is a top priority. We continue to urge the City and State to budget funds to adequately forecast transit and traffic growth projection so we can plan accordingly. Robust housing construction in CB1 has increased the populations of Greenpoint and Williamsburg. The public transit system is strained, however, and has yet to keep up with the pace of development. The L, G, and J/M trains are overcrowded, and many commuters have long bus commutes. Our convoluted bus routes must provide direct and expedient access to key locations. We support an assessment of our current bus routes and a study of where dedicated bus lanes or busways could more efficiently move residents and could put better employment opportunities within reach. We ask the Department of Transportation to realize the Community Board One's goals for a recommitment to Vision Zero, reliable mass transit, a more accessible and lower-stress walking and biking environment, less congestion and pollution, and more innovative accommodations for the skyrocketing number of delivery vehicles and micro-mobility users on our streets. Prioritizing improvements to our streets, transportation infrastructure, and public realm is a proven way of improving the quality of life for city residents. ","Parks and open space","","Parks, Recreation, and Open Space:   Access to open space and parklands is vital to maintaining our community's mental and physical well-being.  It is, therefore, essential to preserve and protect our parks. We have found that the number of children in the district is steadily increasing, as can be seen with the corresponding increases in public and private school-enrolled pupils (kindergarten – 8th grade). Also, with the huge new housing development, there has been a significant increase in the population. To better serve the community, funding is needed to repair and renovate playgrounds and parks. Also, park enforcement personnel are needed in our neighborhood to protect the safety and security of all park users. More maintenance staff must be assigned to the following facilities: McCarren Park, Cooper Park, Sternberg Park (Lindsay Park), Sgt. Dougherty (to be reconstructed with the Kosciuszko Bridge Project), P.S. 84 Playground, Martinez Playground, La Guardia Playground, Bushwick Houses Pool.  Also, adequate recreation staffing must be assigned to Metropolitan Pool and major facilities such as McCarren, McGolrick and Sternberg Parks. Finally, firm commitments to secure adequate, year-round recreation, security, and medical first aid staffing at McCarren Pool must be made a very high department priority.   Also, funding is requested to renovate restrooms and play equipment in playgrounds.  The creation of a restroom at WNYC Transmitter Park.  Funding for the Renovation of the McCarren Park Asphalt Field, the renovation of the Handball courts, and identifying available space to construct a Pickleball counts.","","","","","Environmental health issues (noise, lead, respiratory illness, moisture, mildew, mold, etc.)","","RECENT HEALTH TRENDS Community Board No. 1 had ranked third out of the 59 districts citywide with a high number of asthma cases. Despite a city-wide drop in cases, our district still has a high rate. We remain concerned in any rise in cases of asthma in the district. Funds must be earmarked for additional testing, education and specialized treatment. Several years ago there was a CDC cancer and asthma study conducted in this District and we strongly support a new, updated study be carried out. In addition, the DEP ought to conduct a study of air and traffic pollution (which is particularly bad in our District) and their environmental and health impacts.  We continue to support efforts by the Department of Health & Mental Hygiene, DEP and HPD to thwart lead poisoning as it is a very serious condition, especially for children. Children with lead poisoning may develop health, learning and behavior problems. Education about lead poisoning is important so that people can make their homes safe and healthy as well as learn about treatment and access to testing.  Reports about AIDS in New York City have yielded the following figures for Community Board No. 1: the rates of new HIV diagnosis in Greenpoint and Williamsburg-Bushwick health districts range 0.50 & 1.30 per 1,000 persons/population.  The combined rates for our district  are above the rates for Brooklyn (0.68), New York City (0.84) and the US (1.14). Rates of  people living with HIV & AIDS show Greenpoint at 5.5 and Williamsburg-Bushwick at 12.1 per 1,000 persons/population which again, is above the rates of Brooklyn (6.4), NYC (9.2) and US (3.2). We urge that the medical community continue addressing this grave disease and that additional programs be developed toward prevention, education and treatment.  As the only New York City hospital within blocks of Community Board No. 1 Woodhull Hospital must be aggressive in addressing the needs of all of our constituents. We would be remiss if we did not raise concern about the current health COVID-19 crisis which has tightly gripped our City this year. This virus is spread from person to person and has been found to exist on surfaces in the environmental. It is new health issue that can only be dealt with stringent measures of containment, social distancing and mass testing. An effective vaccine is in development. It is encouraging that public health officials announce that such a vaccine is close to fruition and may be distributed starting early next year.   ","Health Services - Our district has serious health issues that must be addressed. CB #1 remains concerned about the delivery of health care services in the district and supports efforts for improvement. The top causes of death for residents of Greenpoint and Williamsburg, as for most New Yorkers, are heart disease and cancer. Death rates due to heart disease, flu and pneumonia, diabetes, stroke and liver disease are higher in Greenpoint and Williamsburg when compared to the City rates. Quality Health Care - A lack of quality health care can lead to negative health outcomes and more intensive treatment, such as avoidable hospitalizations. Access to health care is therefore a needed focus. About one in six adults in Greenpoint and Williamsburg has no health insurance, and one in eight goes without needed medical care. We urge continued funding for asthma patient care, research and education. We were pleased when a dental clinic (Williamsburg) was reopened to provide much needed services for youngsters in the district whose families do not have adequate financial means or insurance coverage, and were left dismayed that the clinic was again closed as a budget savings measure by HHC in 2010. We support any necessary funding to reopen and maintain the clinic within our district. The only dental clinic that offers free and affordable dental care is located in Woodhull Hospital, a facility not located in our district's confines. In addition, we urge that emerging health care need trends (such as access to health care, treatment and prevention of heart disease, psychological & mental illness treatment) be addressed. The Brooklyn Hospital/Mt. Sinai in its 2015 report relates that the burden of both asthma and hypertension have increased to 18% and 33% respectively in our district. We remain concerned about the COVID-19 pandemic and response from the various health agencies. Funding must be allocated for continued outreach, testing, vaccine development and distribution. ","(The following is an excerpt from our full Statement of District Needs)    SENIOR CITIZEN HOUSING    We note that there is a great need for housing of the elderly and an increasing senior citizen population in Community Board No. 1 (over 20,000) remains of paramount concern. In the past, we have been successful in obtaining Section 202 (federal) funding for various senior housing developments in the district: Jennings Hall, Monsignor Vetro Houses, Metropolitan Houses, Monsignor Jarka Hall, Los Sures Senior Citizens Development, Dupont Street Mary D’Angelis Senior Housing) and Huron Street Senior Housing. We urge that similar efforts continue in Greenpoint/Williamsburg, with additional Section 202 sites submitted by private and City  sources and evaluated by Community Board No. 1 prior to being recommended to the City. Where there is a shortage of senior citizen, assisted living housing, and nursing homes (a nursing home was targeted for construction at the former Greenpoint Hospital campus)  in the district, we hope that the City will develop this targeted housing as promised by a previous administration. However, HPD has failed miserably in communicating with this Board.    (SEE FULL STATEMENT OF DISTRICT NEEDS FOR CONTENT)","(The following is an excerpt )    HOUSING FOR THE HOMELESS    We continue to support and urge a continuation of the reduction in the census at the remaining temporary shelter at the former Greenpoint Hospital. The positive positions taken by the Community Board are well known to the City.  We applaud the revised policy changes by  the City and look forward to the eventual results, a reduction/elimination of the “warehousing” of the homeless in our Community District and throughout the City. Expensive temporary housing must be replaced with permanent low-rent housing, including housing for single individuals, in each Community District. We also urge the expansion of support services to identify and address individual medical/social needs of homeless individuals residing in city and private facilities    HOMELESS SERVICES    Community Board No. 1 approves the downsizing plan that decreased the census a the former Greenpoint Hospital Site, as the City has agreed to do at all other “armory” type shelters. We agree with the City’s decision to limit the overall census at any one site to 200 persons or less, and we hope that this number can be further reduced.     In the past, Community Board No. 1 supported the development of compassionate and effective programs for the homeless. We share the City’s basic policy to provide shelter to  those who request it and, in 1983 were the only Board in Brooklyn to positively respond to the Mayor’s appeal to suggest potential shelter sites.    Our recommended location, the former Most Holy Trinity Convent, was initially identified as a shelter for homeless women, and subsequently opened as a model S.R.O. facility. We have supported this excellent private shelter administered by Most Holy Trinity Parish, and  stand ready to assist the efforts of other local community groups to establish similar programs.    The City should review regulatory policies toward private facilities, in which, homeless individuals reside such as, the Clay Family Residence (at the former Greenpoint Hotel building). Also, the City must insure that adequate support services are provided to maintain the safety of surrounding residents and to minimize quality of life problems. We have received complaints regarding the newly opened Clay Family Residence about the facility's clients loitering and fighting outside.    Community Board No. 1 had vehemently opposed the Department of Homeless Services’ (DHS’s) and the Doe Fund’s advancement of a shelter at 89-111 Porter Avenue. We were truly saddened that the Appellate division failed to find merit for appeal when the City found a loophole in the ULURP process and sited this “homeless” shelter in the heart of a city designated “in place industrial park”. We remain concerned about the establishment of a homeless facility at 400 McGuinness Blvd, (a former factory building that a previous owner eyed for residential development) and 66 Clay Street (aka the Greenpoint Hotel/SRO). We remain concerned about these facilities and any associated rise in crime statistics demonstrated for the area.     (CONTINUED - SEE FULL STATEMENT OF DISTRICT NEEDS)","(THIS IS AN EXCERPT FROM OUR STATEMENT OF DISTRICT NEEDS)    HOUSING    Affordable housing in Community Board No. 1 is a top priority that must be addressed as a critical need. If our neighborhoods are to remain viable and attract/retain jobs and a stable work force, an adequate supply of decent and affordable housing must be available at various income levels.    Community Board No. 1 generally supports the policies articulated by the City, that provides an unprecedented portion of City Capital Budget funding for housing in a manner that gives increased priority to the development of low and moderate income housing. As we have stated in previous years, three general principles must be incorporated into any equitable comprehensive housing plan:    FIRST, those currently funded housing programs that have proven successful must be held harmless from the reduction in past federal assistance, even if an increased City Tax Levy contribution is required to achieve this end.     SECOND, in allocating additional housing funds between the poor and middle class economic segments of our society, it is essential that the first priority be assigned to the poorest segment of our population, those who must bear the brunt of the housing crisis. However, we strongly support the need for affordable housing (both rental and home ownership) for all economic groups.    THIRD, any additional housing funds must be allocated in a fair and equitable manner that responds to the most critical housing needs of each Community District, with a clear and largely advertised marketing throughout the district.     (SEE FULL STATEMENT OF DISTRICT NEEDS FOR CONTENT)","","","","","School and educational facilities (Maintenance)","","We advocate for improvements identified by the schools necessary to continue providing educational instruction and after-school programs. Especially important are funding capital needs and expense items essential for schools because  Covid-19 continues impacting our community with huge waves of infections. Schools need funding for cleaning, testing, social distancing, health instruction, etc.","We support an overall master planning effort for the Department of Education's District 14. With the acknowledged change in student population, schools in our district must be retooled to address the ever changing needs, especially with protocols related to COVID-19. We continue to see the growing importance of having our youth able to appropriately harness remote learning, tablet/computer based educational resources, and sufficient internet capabilities. We remain supportive of our area schools and their expressed needs  previously related to our Board: outfitting each school with a science laboratory and to provide wireless computers and stations for the schools within the Community School District. We continue to support (1) After School, Saturday, Summer Instructional and Recreational Programs; and (2) Repair, Refinishment of our area's School Buildings. In the past, budget cuts to several capital projects caused them to be eliminated in a number of schools and many educational programs were either ceased or reduced as well as staff connected with those programs. We are concerned about the need for student protection and support all recognized security programs approved by the Department of Education to protect our children. A major push by parents, community residents and teachers to reorganize the academically declining Comprehensive Eastern District High School proved to be quite successful as the 850 Grand Street Campus facility was instituted. In 1996 the Board of Education started three smaller schools, also called academies, that focused on particular themes of study (Progress HS for Professional Careers; Enterprise Business HS; and the School for Legal Studies), and eventually phased out Eastern District High School. Since that time, several other smaller schools are established in our district: the Academy for Young Writers; Williamsburg Preparatory School; Williamsburg HS for Architecture and Design; El Puente Academy for Peace and Justice; Harry Van Arsdale HS GED; Green School: An Academy for Environmental Careers; and charter schools: Williamsburg Collegiate Charter School; Williamsburg Charter HS (""Beginning with Children"" was a pioneer charter school in our community for elementary school age youngsters. It grew out of a private partnership with Pfizer and opened its doors in September 1992). We look forward to our educational facilities having future success in serving the educational needs of our children. We have received the expressed needs (list shown below of schools within the confines of CB #1) from School District #14's superintendent. Schools Needs MS 126 424 Leonard Street - Air conditioning in the auditorium and cafeteria PS 132 320 Manhattan Ave. - 13 classroom air conditioners are not functioning, as well as the air conditioners in the Performing Arts Space and in the cafeteria. PS 147 325 Bushwick Ave. - Comprehensive Auditorium Upgrade including Electrical Wiring to accommodate air conditioning systems, new seating and floors, state-of-the-art stage equipment to include a defined stage area with backstage, lighting, sound. - Comprehensive Bathroom Upgrades for students and adults building-wide to include new plumbing, flushing systems, toilets, sinks, wall tiles, floors. - Window Upgrade (entire building). PS 250 108 Montrose Ave. - Bathroom upgrades. - Brighter lighting in the Gym. - School yard upgrades. - New closet Doors in Classrooms. PS 319 360 Keap Street - New PA System. - New Windows. - Courtyard Resurface. - New toilets and sinks for student restrooms. Additional comments for the needs of PS 250 are: Multi Media Center at PS 250 - Comprehensive Multi Media Center for students and community members to have the opportunity to learn photography, film-making, animation, graphics, podcasting, and other forms of communication. This proposal calls for state of the art technology and support for media. A Modern Gym at PS 250 - The idea is to resurface the gym floor with hardwood and to install new wall padding. We also need the basketball hoops fixed. The gym lighting needs to be upgraded, and the gym needs bleachers installed. Restroom Upgrade - The student restrooms have not been upgraded in over two decades. School Yard Upgrade - Repair broken asphalt and overall redesign Auditorium Upgrade - Add air conditioning system, new seating, state of the art stage equipment to encompasses backstage upgrade, new sound system, projector upgrades, and lighting enhancements It has been reported by the Department of City Planning that according to the Census, out of the total district's population, in the group 5 years and over: 89,085 persons are proficient and 57,775 are not proficient in English. Those persons not proficient in English had another language spoken at home. Roughly 46.5% spoke Spanish/Spanish Creole; 20.8% spoke Polish; 20.5% spoke Yiddish (with the remainder percentage scattered in other categories). We encourage programs that will assist persons with attaining better English proficiency skills. The various educational programs and school facilities found in our district must be carefully operated to address the various necessary safe practices (i.e. social distancing, remote learning, testing) to stem the spread of the COVID-19 virus. Schools must have proper ventilation (fresh airflow) including air conditioning during the hot months. ","(THIS IS AN EXCERPT FROM OUR FULL FY 2020 STATEMENT OF DISTRICT NEEDS)      YOUTH SERVICES    More than 51,600 residents of Community Board No. 1 are 19 years of age or less, and  a very high percentage of this population resides in the poorest portions of the district. Unless  an effective network of youth service programs is established, many of these youths will never have a fair opportunity to succeed in life, and will instead be attracted to the alternate lifestyles of crime and drugs. In light of this, the appallingly small allocation for delinquency prevention and after school programs funded by the Department of Youth and Community Development remains a perpetual source of frustration to the Board’s Youth & Education Committee.    We are also concerned with the closing of youth centers at our public housing developments. The  youth  center at the  Cooper  Park  Housing  development  is  closed  in the     evenings. The closings should be stopped and these centers reopened and financially supported.  Not only do they provide vital recreation but are safe havens for the youths.    The Beacon program located at 850 Grand Street Campus has offered a valuable resource, but is not enough to service the approximately 51,625 youths of our district. Unless  the City and State agree to substantially bolster this modest allocation, and a 100% increase is not-out-of order, its impact upon the youth of Community Board No. 1 will remain slight. We were pleased that the City expanded Beacon Programs citywide and, as a result, additional Beacon programs for our area have been made available at MS 126 and MS 50. The Beacon program at MS 126 has served as an anchor for a newly formed “Greenpoint-Williamsburg  Youth Soccer League” that has over 500 youths. There is extremely limited open space to accommodate these youngsters to play concurrent games and we urge that additional space be made available for this use.    We are concerned about the sudden increase in the number of Charter Schools being sited in the district (Community School District 14 serves the CB #1 area). Often they are being collocated in existing school buildings. We raise the question of their having a negative impact upon funding allocations for our existing public schools.    YOUTH EMPLOYMENT    The Department of Youth and Community Development must increase the number of slots and continue to develop and expand local sponsorship within Community District No. 1 for the City’s “Summer Youth Employment Program”. It must take a more aggressive role in addressing program sponsorship in each Community Board area. We urge the City to increase its outreach within the community to obtain non-profit agency sponsors who will adequately service our youths.    TEEN PREGNANCY    One of the most serious problems involving youth is adolescent pregnancy, which had reached epidemic proportions throughout North Brooklyn. We are pleased to learn that  statistics in this area are starting to show a decline. It is essential that a systematic approach to this problem is continued aimed at preventing unwanted pregnancies form occurring in the first place and providing educational and social services to the teen mothers in order to prevent long term welfare dependency.","","","","","Emergency service delivery (including rapid response)","","(Excerpt Statement of District Needs)We note the valuable contribution of the anti-drug housed at the 90th Precinct. We urge continued efforts by the NYPD to deter illegal drug dealing in our community and reduce crime.  We are concerned about the lack of planning on both New York State and New York City levels concerning the legalization of marijuana operations. Since the ""legalization"" of marijuana, we fear New York State has no firm grasp.  Also, the foot patrolman is a valuable public safety resource, and more personnel must be put on patrol to increase efficiency and address quality of life type complaints. We are pleased that they have started “NCO.” Each sector team has two officers designated as the neighborhood coordination officers (NCOs).   We supported the installation of these cameras on McGuinness Blvd, especially at the intersection of Norman Avenue, where Public School 34 is located.    Community Board No. 1, unfortunately, had the distinction of being in the top three of the community districts with the highest suspicious fire rates. The devastating 10+ alarm fire in 2006 at the Greenpoint Terminal Market (remarked as rivaling the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center) shows too dramatically the need for fire protection and the full complement needed to investigate and solve suspicious fires.   We must not forget that a large percentage of housing stock was lost in our communities during the arson ravages of the 1970’s. It was only through prevention, education, investigation, and the bringing to justice those persons criminally responsible that the spread of fire damage was stemmed. We continue to rank within the top five community boards regarding total incidents. We oppose any plan by the Administration to close any more units!  With the closing of St. Catherine’s Hospital in 1964 and the Greenpoint Hospital shutdown in 1982, the Greenpoint/Williamsburg community remains void of any hospital facility within its confines. Although vibrant and expanding, the communities of Greenpoint/Williamsburg continue to have an older population ( a rising young one) and thus rely on the Fire services and EMS Engine Companies with defibrillators to be the “1st Responders” when needed. As a community in a renaissance, we have seen a steady rise in population (noted in the 2020 census). We believe this figure is far short of the actual increase (the notable growing population includes many new families with young children, and there is a boom in the restaurant/bar type businesses with many patrons attracted from both inside and outside the community). We are concerned about the delivery of health services in the district, especially during the COVID-19 Pandemic. Our response teams need to be fully funded and staffed. ","POLICE DEPARTMENT STAFFING - Adequate police protection is a basic public right, and we urge the Community Board No. 1's two local precincts - the 90th and 94th - receive their fair share of any additional police staffing. Community Board #1 is experiencing a renaissance. Current population statistics topple over census figures as new faces fill our streets as we become the trendy place to live; even more to visit. New residences are constructed or lofts are converted, new entertainment venues are being developed. While we are enjoying this popularity, it comes with a cost. Our two police precincts, the 90th and 94th, continue to be severely overburdened with addressing the many quality of life issues that arise with the many different lifestyles of our new and existing populations. For example, Bedford Avenue (between Metropolitan Avenue and North 12th Street; North 6th Street between Bedford and Kent Avenue) has become a Mecca for bars, eateries - and on the whole - a new venue for nightlife in Williamsburg. Policing is a necessary ingredient for this venue to be successful, not only for the City as a tax revenue base, but being able to weave this trend into an existing community. Likewise, the introduction of clubs, bars and galleries in Greenpoint has also created a greater enforcement need - constituents are walking the streets at later hours whereas past trends of earlier bedtimes drew less police action. We are highly concerned about the sudden rise of huge venues for entertainment that are opening in the district, especially within our industrial/manufacturing enclaves. These large venues are geared to attract thousands of patrons to their doors per event. Such numbers require tight security plans and safety management. In lieu of this ever- changing scenario Community Board No. 1 seeks immediate action in the assignment of additional police officers to the 90th and 94th Police Precincts. In addition, the growth in the residential and commercial population has brought a great deal more vehicular, pedestrian, and bicycle traffic to the district. We would greatly benefit from more traffic enforcement agents, particularly along our busiest and increasingly dangerous corridors: Graham Avenue, Flushing Avenue, Metropolitan Avenue, Bedford Avenue, and Manhattan Avenue. Since the implementation of a cycling network in our district, we are compelled to respond to increased complaints by residents that cyclists are not adhering to rules of safety. We call upon the Administration to begin a program of identification license plates for bicycles. Revenues attained by the plating of bicycles can be used to implement additional safety measures to protect cyclist, pedestrians and motorists. We believe that the implementation of the BikeShare program warrants the need for police personnel to be dedicated for bicycles safety enforcement. We continue to support the installation of surveillance cameras within the City's subway stations. The cameras have aided the police in deterring crime and apprehending criminals. We support requests made by our local precinct(s) commanders to install these cameras, monitored by NYPD personnel, in our district's stations (G, L, M/J lines). This should result in the assignment of adequate police officers to each facility to maintain the recently reduced crime rate and maintain around the clock coverage of all police sectors in each precinct. In addition, it is essential that the number of police officers assigned to the eight NYC Housing Authority developments located in Community Board No. 1 be significantly increased, whereas Cooper Park was turned over to the 94th Precinct. This should be duplicated throughout Community District #1 area. Turning NYCHA sites over to their respective precincts for a more local policing strategy is the right thing to do! We remain concerned about the health and safety of our police during this COVID-19 Pandemic. They need to receive necessary funding to secure the personal protection equipment and other safeguarding measures to reduce risk. ","(Excerpt from FY 2019 Statement of District Needs)    FDNY/EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES   We continue to be in “shock and awe” with the Mayor’s decision to close Engine Company 212 that we are compelled to once again reiterate our extreme and vehement opposition to any Fire Station closings.  The future of our community depends on this essential service.  We oppose any plan by the Administration to close any more units!     With the closing of St. Catherine’s Hospital in 1964 and the Greenpoint Hospital shutdown in 1982, the Greenpoint/Williamsburg community remains void of any hospital facility within its confines.  Although vibrant and expanding, the communities of Greenpoint/Williamsburg continue to have an older population (and a rising young one) and thus rely on the Fire services, EMS, Engine Companies with defibrillators to be the “1st Responders” when needed.  For the period of January – May 2016, our fire companies responded to 4,933 emergencies (total emergency & medical responses) as “Certified First Responders-Defibrillators” in Community Board No. 1.  The ranking for our district is the third highest in Brooklyn with Emergency Medical total responses. The total number for Nonfire and Nonmedical Emergencies for this year to date (May) is 2,783 noting our district as the highest in Brooklyn with these responses.  There were 238 responses to structural fires and 223 nonstructural fire responses, with a total of 461 year to date, ranking our district as first with the highest number. In 2015, from January to December, CB #1 ranked third in the borough with 13,539 total incidents handled by the FDNY.     As a community in renaissance, we have seen a steady rise in population (noted in the 2010 census). We believe that this figure is far short of the actual increase (the notable growing population includes many new families with young children, and there is a boom in the restaurant/bar type businesses with many patrons attracted from both inside and outside the community).       An increased risk of fire is connected with restaurant operations, as well as possible food/choking hazard emergencies.  We remain concerned about the lack of fire and emergency medical service coverage in this section of our district.     The exodus of the commercial use to that of residential is extremely problematic mainly as well because most – if not all – of the properties are wood beam construction with an extreme potential for fire.     We applaud the Fire Department’s efforts to bring better service via the concept of housing EMT bases strategically located in the community.  A location was identified and secured within Community Board No. 1 (332 Metropolitan Avenue). After several delays this facility’s construction was completed and operating. The FDNY has made little attempt if any, to site a location to serve the northern portion of Greenpoint.  We hereby call upon the Administration to address the community’s need for ready ambulance services.

It exacerbates the adverse environmental conditions that come from traffic, industrial uses and waste processing.","(Excerpt from our Statement of District Needs) SEWER CONSTRUCTION As one of Brooklyn' oldest communities, Community District No. 1 naturally suffers from a terribly outdated and inadequate sewer system. The continued upgrading and replacement of our sewers remains an on-going necessity. The stretch of Graham Avenue, from Meeker Avenue to Metropolitan Avenue, continues to be plagued by foul sewer odors that emanate from the catch basins. To date, DEP has not been able to resolve the condition. An additional unresolved sewer related matter is DEP's failure to step up to the plate and aggressively correct numerous cave-in conditions from previous sewer pipe work that now requires trench restoration. These are sites where there was inadequate shoring, or wood shoring that was never removed and decayed causing underground subsurface voids which have subsequently collapsed. The Department of Environmental Protection continues to drag its feet in this matter while every day these conditions worsen and present public safety hazards. Community Board No. 1 has forwarded the following locations since 1999 to receive priority attention: • Clymer Street between Wythe and Bedford Avenues • Division Avenue between Berry Street and Wythe Avenue • Eckford Street between Norman and Nassau Avenues • Grand Street between Humboldt Street and Morgan Avenue • Maujer Street between Lorimer Street and Union Avenue • Meserole Street between Lorimer Street and Union Avenue • Montrose Avenue between Union Avenue and Buschwick Place • Moore Street between Humboldt Street and Manhattan Avenue • North 6th Street between Driggs Avenue and Roebling Street • Rutledge Street between Bedford/Marcy/Lee Avenues • Scholes Street between Morgan and Union Avenues • Skillman Avenue between Humboldt Street and Graham Avenue • Ten Eyck Street at Lorimer Street These locations were to be addressed in FY 2009, however, the Department of Design and Construction relates that the work is delayed because DEP says they have no funding! In another portion of the District, the area directly under and north of the Kosciuszko Bridge continues to be forgotten and floods constantly with the free-fall drainage from the BQE. Sewer construction here has been delayed, too. This item also needs to be promptly addressed by the responsible environmental agencies of both the City and State.  ","(Excerpt from the 2020 Statement of District Needs)  SANITATION GARAGES    The construction of a new garage to serve Community District 1 and 4 was completed. The Department of Sanitation has not acted responsibly to relocate the K-3 Sanitation Garage.  It still needs to be placed in Community District #3 and no longer be situated in our district. The Department of Sanitation must take immediate corrective action to relocate this to its respective district as per co-terminality guidelines and not juggle it within the confines of Community Board No. 1.  The DOS relocation of BK3 to the old BK4 site remains completely unacceptable.    STREET CLEANING REGULATIONS    We urge the Department of Sanitation to change the parking regulations to reduce the number of street cleaning days from four to two. We should be treated like any other  Community Board and be granted a reduction.","","","","","Affordable housing creation","","We have noted in our Statement of District Needs that Affordable Housing - Affordable Housing in Community Board No. 1 is a top priority that must be addressed as a critical need.  The lack of affordable housing options continues to be the most significant concern to Brooklyn Community Board One. We are skeptical that the 2005 rezoning has produced the number of projected affordable units. While we have seen plenty of higher-end luxury housing created in our district, sadly, those units are out of reach for many residents of North Brooklyn. And when MIH units are included in a new development, the affordable rents still tend to be set too high for many of the neediest residents to access. There is a severe need for affordable senior housing and larger units with multiple bedrooms for families. Both of these continue to be urgently needed in our district. We look forward to analyzing the City of Yes for Housing Opportunity proposal over the coming year."," HOTEL DEVELOPMENT CB #1 seeks the City to address an issue that is of increasing importance to our community: hotel development. As the landscape of the city changes, more and more hotels are being built in neighborhoods that are historically residential, such as ours. Hotels have an outsized, often disruptive, impact on our communities and we urgently need a process that provides real community input on hotel development. Recent hotel growth in Brooklyn has been in residential and industrial areas, crowding out local communities, manufacturing spaces, and affordable housing. This hotel growth has led to the gentrification and homogenization of our communities, and it has inflated rents and property taxes. To maintain our vibrant city, every effort should be made to preserve socioeconomic diversity and keep our neighborhoods affordable for the mix of uses (residential, community spaces, artistic) that currently exist. We need a real voice in the development process and an opportunity to engage developers before they start building. The simplest, most comprehensive approach is to amend the Zoning Resolution so that new hotels may only be developed by special permit. We strongly support a city-wide special permit requirement for hotels. This will empower communities and put residents and our representatives in City Council and in the Borough President's office on more equal footing with hotel developers, who have too often disregarded substantive issues.  ","(Excerpt from FY 2020 Statement of District Needs)  HOUSING      Affordable housing in Community Board No. 1 is a top priority that must be addressed as a critical need.  If our neighborhoods are to remain viable and attract/retain jobs and a stable work force, an adequate supply of decent and affordable housing must be available at various income levels.  As we have stated in previous years, three general principles must be incorporated into any equitable comprehensive housing plan:      FIRST, those currently funded housing programs that have proven successful must be held harmless from the reduction in past federal assistance, even if an increased City Tax Levy contribution is required to achieve this end.

However, we strongly support the need for affordable housing (both rental and home ownership) for all economic groups.      THIRD, any additional housing funds must be allocated in a fair and equitable manner that responds to the most critical housing needs of each Community District, with a clear and largely advertised marketing throughout the district.      We will now apply these principals to the major housing concerns of Greenpoint and Williambsurg:      While we were extremely encouraged by the Administration’s “Points of Agreement” with the NYC Council and its consideration of the Greenpoint-Williamsburg zoning and related ULURP actions, several points were noted in this document, including affordable housing, which the Administration agreed to significantly increase through a variety of mechanisms including inclusionary zoning, financial and tax incentives.  In addition to increasing the number of affordable units in the district, the Administration agreed to anti-harassment provisions to be provided separately, as part of a follow-up corrective action.  The lack of progress on the many areas outlined in the Agreement shows a violation of the spirit of this document.  The ill-fated plans to create a Greenpoint-Williamsburg Affordable Housing and Infrastructure Fund of up to $10 million, to be managed by HPD, using proceeds received from the sale of air rights from the MTA site on Commercial Street in Greenpoint never happened. Harassment and displacement continues unmitigated.          All efforts must be made to implement those previously proposed projects that have yet to be funded.  It is essential that the City realizes the need for low income rental housing/ownership and provide the much needed funds that will help compensate for the past tragic loss of Federal housing subsidies.  The inclusion of such programs by the Mayor, an overall comprehensive housing program, is an absolute necessity for our district.  Homeownership in low-income communities is seriously weak.  In other areas of the country, the Section 8 subsidy is utilized for home purchasing.  We urge that a similar pilot program be brought to NYC, and that Greenpoint and Williamsburg is considered for inclusion.

This would allow these businesses to bid on the work and allow residents to work on these projects. Any workers hired for these projects must receive a living wage. Developers should hire responsible contractors to address the high fatality rates seen in New York construction.  ","","","","","Traffic safety and enforcement (cars, scooters, ebikes, etc.)","","TRANSPORTATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE  We ask the Department of Transportation to realize Community Board One's goals for a recommitment to Vision Zero, reliable mass transit, a more accessible and lower-stress walking and biking environment, less congestion and pollution, and more innovative accommodations for the skyrocketing number of delivery vehicles and micro-mobility users on our streets. Prioritizing improvements to our streets, transportation infrastructure, and public realm is a proven way of improving the quality of life for city residents.  Also, the public transit system has not kept up with the pace of the increasing population. Newly constructed buildings have brought – and will continue to bring – thousands of new residents to Greenpoint and Williamsburg, which has strained the public transit system.  The L, G, and J/M   trains are overcrowded, and our bus routes fail to provide direct and expedient access to key locations.  Many commuters have excessively long bus commutes. We support an assessment of our current bus routes and a study of where dedicated bus lanes or buses could move residents around North Brooklyn more efficiently. This would save time for residents and could put better employment opportunities within reach.  Also, we continue to support the funding of the train station and transit improvement including camera surveillance and improved lighting, for public safety.  ","TRANSPORTATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE TRANSPORTATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE  Transportation and Infrastructure in Community Board No. 1 is a top priority. We continue to urge the City and State to budget funds to adequately forecast transit and traffic growth projection so we can plan accordingly. Robust housing construction in CB1 has increased the populations of Greenpoint and Williamsburg. The public transit system is strained, however, and has yet to keep up with the pace of development. The L, G, and J/M trains are overcrowded, and many commuters have long bus commutes. Our convoluted bus routes must provide direct and expedient access to key locations. We support an assessment of our current bus routes and a study of where dedicated bus lanes or busways could more efficiently move residents and could put better employment opportunities within reach. We ask the Department of Transportation to realize the Community Board One's goals for a recommitment to Vision Zero, reliable mass transit, a more accessible and lower-stress walking and biking environment, less congestion and pollution, and more innovative accommodations for the skyrocketing number of delivery vehicles and micro-mobility users on our streets. Prioritizing improvements to our streets, transportation infrastructure, and public realm is a proven way of improving the quality of life for city residents.  ","MASS TRANSIT: Mass transit is woefully inadequate to meet the needs of our district. Local bus service is frequently delayed because of overall traffic congestion. Overcrowding on the L and G train lines is so severe that riders often must allow 2, 3, or more trains to go by before they can board;  For those North Brooklyn commuters who solely depend on the G, improved service must be a priority.   There needs to be a better connection to trains that travel to and from Manhattan. The connection at Court Square for the G line remains inadequate and difficult to navigate. We continue to advocate that there be a free transfer between the G line and the elevated (J/M) line (Broadway/Hewes Street). We were pleased that the temporary extension of the G line that brought it further into Brooklyn was made permanent. The Greenpoint Avenue station on the G line needs to be upgraded to include a public announcement system as one is sorely lacking. Delays in service on the line leave riders at this station in the dark because there is no communication. Ferry service has resumed at the CB #1's waterfront with an expanded service. We ask that the ferry service be ""hooked into"" the NYC Transit's fare system to allow payment by use of a MetroCard. In down times on the G, the ferry could serve as an alternate mode of transportation to and from Manhattan, Long Island City, or further into Brooklyn where they may stop. We are pleased that EDC has expanded the ferry service in our district making commuting to other boroughs more conducive.  ","","","","","Park care and maintenance","","(Excerpt from  Statement of District Needs)      PARKS & RECREATION    INCREASE STAFFING    The over 110 acres of parkland in Community Board No. 1 represent a precious resource, the potential of which remains to be realized due to the continued erosion of Park Department staff.  Maintenance workers cannot begin to supply even minimal coverage of our heavily utilized parks and underscore the need to provide for the proper maintenance of these facilities.  We have observed a steady increase in the number of children enrolled in public and private schools (kindergarten – 8th grade) within the district. As a result, it is necessary to assign supervisory staff positions and maintenance staff to the following facilities:: McCarren Park, Cooper Park, Sternberg Park (Lindsay Park), Sgt. Dougherty (to be reconstructed with the Kosciuszko Bridge Project), P.S. 84 Playground, Martinez Playground, La Guardia Playground, Bushwick Houses Pool.  Also, adequate recreation staffing should be assigned to Metropolitan Pool and such major facilities as McCarren, McGolrick and Sternberg Parks.  We request a firm commitment to secure adequate, year-round recreation, security, and medical first aid staffing at McCarren Pool. Finally,  some parks require restorations and upgrades of playground equipment and restrooms.","PARKS & RECREATION RETENTION AND EXPANSION OF PARKLAND As the pertinent City Planning Department studies indicate, Community District No. 1 is one of the most under-served area with regard to park and recreation services. Thus, we would strongly oppose the elimination of any currently mapped parkland in our district or usage/renting of same for other than parkland/recreation unless as per current City policy, equivalent space is developed as parkland in the immediate vicinity. We also strongly support the establishment of additional parks and playgrounds within our borders. Community Board No. 1 continues its support for the development of appropriate small parks on triangles. The Southside and South Williamsburg have few local parks, and the triangles, such as where Heyward. Wallabout and Wythe Avenue come together, should be implemented. We have requested for many years that the concrete triangle at Meeker Avenue, Morgan Avenue and Driggs Avenue to be greened. We were pleased that the site finally received this treatment, but it has now been destroyed with construction signage from the Kosciuszko Bridge project. We are delighted to see that the Administration proposes the expansion of the Waterfront Park to the Bushwick Inlet and its initial phase has moved forward. This expansion proposal provides much needed recreational space for our residents and insures some greening of the waterfront (the former Sanitation Garage at 50 Kent Avenue was demolished and annexed as parkland/open space). The proposal also suggests the inclusion of a Waterfront Access Plan (WAP). While we support this concept, we most certainly want to be directly involved in the design process. The Administration should commence the condemnation procedures to demonstrate a good faith gesture to our community while carefully retaining jobs and relocating existing businesses.  ","No comments","PUBLIC LIBRARIES - Community Board No. 1 contains four public libraries (Greenpoint, Bushwick, Leonard and Marcy Avenue branches) which provide a variety of services for the community. We  support their needs for enhanced equipment, computer linkages, increased book budgets and physical improvements.    The Leonard Branch has its elevator installed and is still seeking to construct a ramp as well as other sorely needed improvements for this aging Carnegie branch. We support their efforts to have the facility wheelchair accessible. Greenpoint Branch is an existing facility that can no longer accommodate the growing needs of the community in terms of function and programming and the construction of a new facility, on its current footprint, is being sought. We have learned that the work will commence on this project at the end of June. We urge that all efforts be made to accommodate the community with auxiliary service while the branch is closed. It is most encouraging to see that these facilities are being highly used by both young and older residents alike.  CB #1 strongly opposes cuts to the budgets for our libraries.","COMMUNITY BOARDS Community Board No. 1 still lacks adequate funding. The meager budget provided for our board does not keep pace with inflation and any increased operating costs. The cost for acquiring much needed newer technology, computer software, upgraded hardware as well as internet/web access capabilities is expensive. Community Board No. 1 is always facing yet another round of budget cuts in the budget process. While restorations were made this fiscal year, we remain guarded about projected cuts for upcoming fiscal years. Community Boards have not really seen an increase in our budget in over 20 years. The increase this fiscal year was a temporary increase only. Our internal budget is not sufficient enough to meet the ever escalating costs of necessary office operations and staffing. The rapid changes in communications, media and computers, plus the costly upgrading of various programs and equipment would inhibit a Board's daily operations whose insufficient budget covers a small staffing of only three persons (3 full-time ) and miniscule operating (OTPS) cost of $ 10,476. Our office carries out a myriad of services. CB #1 is the mini City Hall for our constituents. We handle complaints, provide comments on projects, land use and develop capital/expense budget lines for the district as well as conduct public hearings and Review of NYS SLA and Cannabis applications. We have 19 established committees that comprehensively tackle matters of concern and service delivery. Our staff also supports the board members in preparing reports, minutes, scheduling of meetings and setting up the space for the meetings. Matters from the public are handled as well, these often range from simple point of information inquiries, ""freedom of information (FOIL)"", to major investigations requiring constant follow up! In addition, we have other operating tasks that are for specifically needed to administer the CB #1's internal operations. These include recordkeeping, timekeeping, budget preparation, monitoring & payment of expenditures, voucher preparation, inventory and auditing. SUSTAINABILITY OF COMMUNITY BOARDS Community boards provide a vital function for the districts they are designated to serve and consequently stand as valuable assets to the City as well. There is urgent need for increased funding as moneys were lost in previous budget crunches and were projected to be further reduced in the upcoming fiscal years. Community Board budgets should not be at the sole whim of the Administration. The NYC Charter's language regarding community boards must be strongly re-written to ensure that community boards are fiscally protected and legislatively promulgated - the budgets must be held harmless from political climates.

Downtown Brooklyn is the third-largest Central Business District in New York City, and the civic center of Kings County/the Borough of Brooklyn. Kings County is the most populous County in New York State, and the 3rd largest ""city"" in the nation by population.  Most of the neighborhoods in BKCD2 were first developed in the nineteenth century as low-density row houses and low-scale commercial streets. The construction of high-rise buildings accelerated after the completion of the Brooklyn Bridge in 1883 and the introduction of elevated rail and streetcar lines. In the early 20th-century multiple subway lines opened in Downtown Brooklyn, which spurred further development of taller residential and commercial buildings until the Great Depression. Since the 2004 rezoning of Downtown Brooklyn, an explosion of high rise development has dramatically changed the housing mix and skyline, including the 2022 completion of the 93-story Brooklyn Tower which is the first ""supertall"" building in Brooklyn, and the tallest building on Long Island.  BKCD2 is represented by 2 Congressional Districts, 2 State Senate Districts, 2 State Assembly Districts, and 2 City Council Districts. Its boundaries include 2 NYPD Precincts, and parts of 3 FDNY Fire Battalions, 2 Health Center Districts, and 2 DOE School Districts. This District shares interests with Manhattan Community Districts 1 and 3 along the East River waterfront, and with Brooklyn Community Districts 6 and 8 in the blocks surrounding the 19,000-capacity Barclays Center arena.   The District is home to a wealth of civic and community facilities:   	Over 100 acres of mapped parkland and public space 	81 Cultural Organizations 	10 of Brooklyn's 43 Designated Historic Districts 	9 of Brooklyn's 23 Business Improvement Districts (BIDs) 	7 City, County, State, and Federal Courthouses and the Brooklyn Detention Complex 	6 Public Libraries including the Center for Brooklyn History and the L10 Arts & Cultural Center 	The 300-acre Brooklyn Navy Yard industrial complex is a waterfront National Historic District which houses over 500 businesses employing 11,000 workers, including the largest U.S. film and television production studio outside of Hollywood.   Municipal Infrastructure:   	1.5 miles (12%) of the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway (BQE) 	85 Parking Lots & Garages 	30 City Office Buildings 	14 DSNY Solid Waste Drop-Off Facilities 	11 MTA subway lines and the Long Island Railroad 	11 Rail Yards 	11 City Maintenance Facilities 	7 Ports & Ferry Landings 	4 Wastewater Treatment Sites 	2 Telecommunications Facilities 	1 Recycling Facility   Health & Human Services:   	26 Hospitals & Clinics 	21 Legal Service Organizations  	16 Mental Health Centers 	11 Senior Service Centers 	9 Chemical Dependency Organizations 	9 Organizations Serving People with Disabilities 	9 Housing & Homeless Services Organizations 	9 Food Distribution Sites 	7 Workforce Development Centers 	4 Residential Health Facilities 	3 NYCHA Cornerstone Community Centers   Youth & Education Facilities:   	62 Daycare and Pre-K 	64 K-12 Schools 	22 After-School Centers 	52 Youth Literacy & Job Training Centers 	16 Vocational Schools 	9 Higher Education Institutions   Districtwide statistics suggest a fairly high quality of life, unfortunately, the aggregation of data obscures the reality of many residents. For example, a comparison of data drawn from two neighboring census tracts indicate a median household income of $290,403 on the north side of York Street toward Vinegar Hill, versus $26,543 across the street bordering the Farragut NYCHA complex.  According to the 2020 census, BKCD2 experienced one of NYC's largest population growths in the preceding decade, with 31% growth in total residents (130,021). Between 2010-2020, annual average median income rose to $100,000 and the District saw 35% growth in total occupied housing units (61,221), however from 2015-2029 median rent also increased 90%.   A shift in demographics was also documented, including a 33% increase in residents under the age of 18 (20,037 total); and shifts in the number of residents self-identifying as:   	 		 			  			 			BKCD2  			 			 			BKCD2 % 			 			 			NYC OVERALL 			 		 		 			White  			62,700 			48.2% 			35.4% 		 		 			Black  			25,029 			19.2% 			26.7% 		 		 			Hispanic  			17,036 			13.1% 			18.9% 		 		 			Asian 			16,669 			12.8% 			13.6% 		 		 			Two Or More Races 			  7,207 			  5.5%   			  4.1% 		 		 			Non-Hispanic Other 			  1,380 			  1.1% 			  1.4% 		 	      In preparation for the FY25 CD Needs Statement, the District Office conducted 8 public meetings between June - October to discuss District needs by Committee topic area. The results of these public meetings were included in the 2nd Annual District Priorities Public Survey, followed by a Board prioritization poll. The public survey and Board poll results were reviewed at the Board's regular Executive Committee public meeting in advance of submission.  One again, the impacts of the District's rapid development and shifting demographic trends were evident in our community's spirited input. Growth is one key indicator of community health, however our residents recognize that this growth requires a proportional increase in affordable housing, transit planning, social services, public safety and sanitation services, and strategies to ensure equitable access to services for all of our neighbors. ","","","","","Affordable Housing","","Affordable Housing has been the #1 Priority for our District since at least 2015 when the Top 3 format was introduced for the FY17 District Statements. Young adults leaving a family home in our District can no longer afford to rent or buy in the neighborhoods where they were raised and have multigenerational family ties, support systems, and care obligations. No resident should live in fear that they may need to leave their neighborhood if their circumstances change. That fear prevents tenants from holding landlords to their agreements for safe, well-tended dwellings. Our Top 40 Capital Requests also reflect the majority opinion that our District is lacking in permanently affordable housing for low-income, medium-income, senior, and special needs households. There were a significant number of specific requests this year (reflected in our Top 25 Expense Requests) related to improving NYCHA maintenance, management, safety, security, and cleanliness. ","Social services","","Last year’s #2 and #3 Top Priorities were Crime & Public Safety and Homelessness, respectively. So it is perhaps a natural evolution of public awareness and opinion that Social Services rose to the #2 spot this year.","Trash removal and cleanliness","","This issue moved to the #3 spot in our District this year, with significant calls for public realm improvements including more on-street receptacles, and more enforcement of scofflaw violations such as dumping, commercial and residential neglect, and unmanaged dog waste. ","","","","","Mental health and substance abuse treatment and prevention programs","","""Mental Health & Substance Abuse Treatment & Prevention Programs"" is a new top priority for District residents in this category, replacing “Services to Reduce or Prevent Homelessness”, perhaps as a reflection of broader public understanding of the underlying causes that can lead to homelessness. Respondents indicated a strong opinion that priority should be given to funding programs that provide care directly at the point of need: in our streets, parks, plazas, and subway stations. We need more professionals working in the public realm who are trained in street assessments, de-escalation techniques, and outreach/intake strategies. This is an opportunity for a Citywide agency staffing shortage to dovetail with the Citywide need for access to quality vocational training and employment opportunities.","","","","","","","","","After school programs","","Our youth need more, and higher-quality general enrichment outside of school hours. We have excellent libraries, parks, and cultural programming but our youth need more safe public spaces to access positive socialization, health services, nutritious meals, and daily opportunities to exercise, learn, train, work, and engage in community. This Board recommends significant investment into high-quality, extended-hour, year-round programming for our youth.  ","","","","","","","Traffic violations and enforcement","","There is blatant disregard for traffic safety, red lights, stop signs, and pedestrian right of way in our District. Reckless delivery drivers, e-scooters, and enhanced motorbikes need to be reined in, and bicycles must obey traffic rules. This District requests significant investment in automated enforcement technologies along with additional traffic enforcement agents (with proper anti-bias training) at our major intersections and high-density public spaces. 71.5% of public survey respondents agree that this is a Top 5 priority for increased funding in our Community District, across all categories of NYPD programs and services. ","","","","","","","Cleanliness/trash collection","","New Yorkers interact with the public realm on sidewalks so these public spaces should set the standard for cleanliness and quality of life. This Board requests significant investment in more “Better Bins” and recycling receptacles deployed along all of our major business, residential, and recreational corridors, and at regular intervals under the BQE. This request moved into the Top 3 overall District priorities this year, with 72.1% of public survey respondents also selecting this as a Top 5 priority across 16 categories of DSNY programs and services.","","","","","","","Affordable housing creation","","This category saw the highest scores and general agreement across all 5 District zip codes, and was our #1 Top overall priority this year, as it has every year since at least 2015 when the Top 3 format was introduced for the FY17 District Statements.   While this specific request was not elevated to a Top Priority this year, we include it as it provides context and color for all of the requests in this category: It has been 20 years since the upzoning of Downtown Brooklyn, and key elements unexpectedly shifted during COVID. As Brooklyn continues to grow in City, State, national, and international importance, this Community District needs a comprehensive assessment of current infrastructure and amenities against known future needs. ","","","","","","","","Traffic safety and enforcement (cars, scooters, ebikes, etc.)","","According to the 2020 census, BKCD2 experienced one of NYC’s largest population increases since the 2010 census, with 31% growth to 130,021 total residents. Growth is a key indicator of community health, however this growth requires a proportional increase in transit planning and public safety considerations. BKCD2 is a highly walkable community, however it is also home to the third-largest Central Business District in New York City, the Brooklyn and Manhattan Bridges, the Brooklyn Queens Expressway, and major Borough and City arterials.   Traversing our major streets and crowded sidewalks is difficult for pedestrians of all ages and abilities, and especially difficult to navigate for residents with limited mobility or special needs. There is also blatant disregard for traffic safety, red lights, stop signs, and pedestrian right of way in our District--often ending in brutal tragedy. While enforcement is one part of the solution, intelligent human-centric design is the preferred tool.   This Board supports infrastructure that improves universal safety and promotes independent mobility. Supporting safe, multi-modal transit has positive impacts on congestion, the environment, and community health, and will encourage more residents to try alternatives to private vehicles. At the same time, government-sponsored (mandated) change implies an equal responsibility for government-led public education and public notice to ensure that all citizens are not just “heard” in their existing opinions and feelings, but also have a real opportunity to learn about and understand the underlying social, environmental and fiscal drivers of proposed changes. Education is the way to win hearts and minds and renew citizen faith in government.","","We need elevators or escalators in all subway stations. Stairs are not manageable for all residents. Parents, the elderly, and those with limited mobility have difficulty navigating our public transit system safely. ","","","","","Park care and maintenance","","The Board is sympathetic to the decades-long and as-yet unsuccessful “1% For Parks” campaign if it is a means to shift DPR prioritization away from reliance on discretionary funding, and toward proactive equitable delivery for every neighborhood. Of the 6 capital projects identified by the agency as their own priorities for our District, District residents voiced the lowest numbers of “Very Important Priority” and the largest numbers of “Not Important” of any agency. BKCD2 acknowledges that we are generally well-provisioned in this category, relative to other Community Districts.   Of note: There is widespread and passionate agreement that our Brooklyn Public Library (BPL) branches are an essential public good that deliver high-quality, progressive, and responsive all-ages educational programming, enrichment, and ad hoc community services. While it was not elevated as a District priority this year relative to other urgent needs (and we have enjoyed several successful capital campaigns in recent years!), there continues to be general support of increasing funding for staffing in order to offer extended hours for youth and families at all branches. ","Every zip code in our District again pleaded for more dog parks, and these requests came equally from both dog owners desiring more legal recreational space, as well as from non-dog owners concerned about hygiene and public safety issues in playgrounds and public thoroughfares. ","BKCD2 acknowledges that we are generally well-provisioned in this category, relative to other Community Districts.

The community district is in the northern section of central Brooklyn and bounded by Flushing Avenue and Broadway on the north, Saratoga Avenue on the east, Atlantic Avenue on the south, and Classon Avenue on the west. It borders community boards 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16.      A 2021 piece in Untapped New York identified Bedford-Stuyvesant as a neighborhood with ""the largest collection of untouched and intact Victorian buildings in the U.S., with hundreds of historic brownstones filling the neighborhood's streets.""      For nearly 100 years, it ""has been a cultural center for the African American community in New York (City).""  Today's Bedford-Stuyvesant is an outgrowth the free Black community of Weeksville established three decades before the end of the Civil War. The Bedford and Stuyvesant Heights sections were developed with many row houses for families in the second half of the nineteenth century. By the 1930s, the combined neighborhood known as Bedford-Stuyvesant had become the city's second largest Black community.     During the mid-20th century, as white immigrant families left central Brooklyn for eastern Queens and Long Island, many Blacks migrating from the American South and others emigrating from the Caribbean found community in the neighborhood. Despite redlining, disinvestment, poverty, and other types of discrimination faced by residents, Bedford-Stuyvesant quickly became a center for Black business, cultural expression and production, homeownership, innovation, activism, and political power.      According to the most recent data published by the Department of City Planning, in the year 2000 Bedford-Stuyvesant had a population of roughly 144,000 residents, three-quarters of whom were Black. In 2021, neighborhood's population had grown by 22.9% to over 177,0000 since 2000 but the Black share of the population had fallen to 40.4%. The decline represents a net loss of more than 36,000 Black residents while the overall population, grew by nearly 33,000.      The demographic shift is the result of dramatic gentrification. A 2018 report by the New York State Comptroller found that: ""Most of the growth has been driven by an influx of new residents, which has changed the neighborhood's composition.  ""New residents are attracted to the neighborhood's brownstones, relatively low housing costs and proximity to Manhattan. With a sharp decrease in crime and an increase in restaurants, cafés, bars, retail shops and live entertainment, Bedford-Stuyvesant is becoming a popular place to live and work.       ""Many of the new residents are immigrants, white, or young, and are likely to have higher incomes than long-term residents. Their arrival has put pressure on housing costs, making it increasingly less affordable for long-term residents, especially seniors, to remain in the neighborhood."" The neighborhood's demographic shift has placed in sharp contrast the challenges we face in Bedford-Stuyvesant. The Comptroller's report also revealed stark, and widening, disparities in median household income between new and long-term residents, with new residents' median household income (roughly $60,000) nearly double that of their neighbors.     Given the community's shifting demographics this disparity is racialized and contributes to neighborhood tensions. If this trend goes unaddressed, racialized income stratification will become even more entrenched.  Three-quarters of residents are renters and over 55% of them are considered rent burdened, devoting more than 30% of their income to rent. About one-third of households dedicate more than half of their incomes to rent. With more than 20,000 NYCHA residents - almost exclusively Black and Latino - across its 15 developments and 8,240 units, Bedford-Stuyvesant has more NYCHA residents than any other community district in Brooklyn.      NYC Health Department reports that residents of Bedford-Stuyvesant suffer from chronic health problems at rate significantly above the city's average. The neighborhood ranks in top ten for rates of smoking, diabetes, new HIV diagnoses, obesity, stroke, mental health, alcohol hospitalizations and adult hospitalizations for asthma. As we emerge from the COVID-19 crisis, Bedford-Stuyvesant is still dealing with impacts of the pandemic and its aftereffects.      Access: The community was very hard hit by the pandemic including many deaths. We need sustained access to treatments (especially seasonal vaccinations) for COVID-19 and other emergent respiratory and contagious illnesses. Continued investment in campaigns and programs that increase awareness and encourage testing, vaccination, and treatment will provide equitable access.    Social services: The stressors of the pandemic magnify the problems faced by vulnerable residents. The impacts of scaling back services and programs has negatively affected individual residents, families, and the community at large.      Over the next few years robust ramping up of mental health supports, domestic violence prevention, senior services, activities for disconnected youth, cure violence and violence interruption programs, and other services that seek to strengthen the social infrastructure will be needed to combat the losses from the pandemic.     Jobs & Business Support: The jobs recovery in Bedford-Stuyvesant has been uneven. Many residents work for small businesses that were hard hit and struggled to get access to state and federal pandemic relief. These structural impediments are barriers to a robust recovery that will generate jobs and help our local small businesses thrive.     Open Space: Less than 3% of the land in Bedford-Stuyvesant is open or recreational space, placing it in the bottom 10 citywide and the second lowest in Brooklyn. In a time when social distancing is continues to be paramount limited open space is a unique challenge in Bedford-Stuyvesant. Not only is open space vital for exercise, but it's also important for mental health and it affords residents opportunities to have responsible social gatherings that limit the spread of the virus.     Broadband and Wi-Fi: COVID-19 has centered the neighborhood's poor broadband and Wi-Fi infrastructure. Internet traffic from home has dramatically increased in Bedford-Stuyvesant since the start of the pandemic largely due to work-from-home and remote learning. We applaud efforts to provide free access at NYCHA and more affordability but we need infrastructure upgrades to help ensure all residents can access high-speed broadband with strong and consistent connectivity.       CONCLUSION Though Bedford-Stuyvesant is acknowledged as a leading incubator for the future without significant investment and programs to address the neighborhood's challenges, many disparities will deepen. They will further marginalize our neighborhood's most vulnerable - poor, Black, and Latino, long-term residents, living in public or low-income housing. Community Board 3 is committed to working with elected officials, government agencies, nonprofits, academia, the business community, civic leaders and groups, and others interested in addressing persistent and emergent issues and building a stronger, more resilient Bedford-Stuyvesant. ","","","","","Affordable Housing","","Stable housing that one can afford is a core social determinant of health. Studies show that affordability impacts housing stability for adults and children and helps them address challenges and pursue goals. Household with affordable rents generally have improved outcomes in employment, health, and education.  The most recent data shows that 54.9% of renters in Bedford-Stuyvesant are rent burdened, paying more than 30% of the income toward rent. 27.5% are severely rent burdened allocated at least 50% of their income to rent. Rent burdened tenants are the most housing insecure and at high risk of homelessness if they experience job loss.   With the median asking rent $2,500 per month for two-bedroom apartment, housing costs are becoming less affordable for both low- and middle-income residents. Most families would need a minimum annual income of $100,000 qualify to rent apartments at the median asking rent. The median rent for renters was $46,600; an affordable rent rate would be $1,165.   Bedford-Stuyvesant needs a variety of affordable housing options, including rents from extremely low income through middle income as well as home-ownership opportunities, that will enable individuals and families to stable lives.  ","Parks and open space","","The dearth of open and green space has emerged as a top community concern particularly during this pandemic era. Less than 3% of the land in Bedford-Stuyvesant is open or recreational space, placing it in the bottom 10 citywide and the second lowest in Brooklyn. Yet the neighborhood's population has surged by nearly 20,000 in the past ten years.  Resources are strained. Space is limited.   As generational demographic shift and increase, residents are using outdoor spaces throughout all seasons and that space does not necessarily equate to being a park or playground. Plazas and squares would be a welcome addition to the community, allowing for safe social congregation or alternative work spaces as more individuals work remotely.","Trash removal and cleanliness","","Bedford-Stuyvesant’s population has surged more than 14% since 2010 and that influx of new resident has impacted trash removal and street cleanliness. Though, street cleanliness has improved in the past year according to the Mayor’s SCORECARD CB3 still lags behind the borough and city wide averages.   This is unacceptable and is evidence of a systematic failing that residents have to deal with on a daily basis.    Cuts to the Sanitation Department in previously fiscal years have significantly impacted neighborhood cleanliness. The pandemic cessation of the organics program, which has never been expanded to Community Board 3, has not equipped residents with tools and practices that help reduce waste.   The district needs a comprehensive approach to trash, waste, and cleanliness including regular collection, effective street sweeping, and enforcement of commercial waste regulations. We also need an investment in education and outreach that promotes diversion practices and waste reduction including a robust organics program.","","","","","Services for low-income and vulnerable New Yorkers","","Services for low-income and vulnerable residents of Bedford-Stuyvesant were insufficient prior to the pandemic. Whether it is a lower wage essential worker, families living in shelter, those living in crowded homes, the unemployed and underemployed, and those that with chronic illness, the pandemic -- and its impacts like inflation -- has been most destabilizing for them and requires a surge in services (like food programs and other supports) that help them maintain sustenance. ","No comments","No comments","No comments","No comments","","","","","Youth workforce development and summer youth employment","","Workforce opportunities for youth is critically needed in Bedford-Stuyvesant. While SYEP offers young people to chance to earn an income as they explore work and career opportunities, year-round opportunities would strengthen engagement with young people. Studies show that meaningfully engage youth with work increases their civic engagement and introduces them to new fields while decreasing the likelihood a young person to participate in petty crime. Work fosters self-confidence, builds skills, and provides necessary economic support for families.","Recent data from first reading and math scores since the start of the pandemic reveal sharp declines for children nationwide. The impact in Bedford-Stuyvesant is more acute because scores in the neighborhood lagged behind national scores prior to the pandemic. Now they are testing even worse.   Investments in individualized and group tutoring in the core subject areas are vital to improving student outcomes.  ","No comments","","","","","Crime prevention programs","","Property crimes, like package theft and car break-ins, as well as violent gun crimes (usually involving gang activities) have increased in the time since the pandemic shutdown.   Increased deliveries has seen an upsurge in package theft. A program to get delivery services to improve protocols on delivery will reduce the number of unattended packages on stoops and in doorways.  Greater attention to the gun trade and how they move on the black market would help to reduce gun violence. Investment in violence prevention efforts like cure violence will engage those most prone to involvement. ","Public safety solutions must be robust and comprehensive. We are not safer with more arrests. Safety means using the full toolkit of resources that minimize and eliminate violence.   We need more investment in violence intervention and prevention work, anti-bullying, out-of-school-time programs focused on youth development, wide access to mental health supports, modern and well-maintained recreational facilites. Evidence shows that all of efforts reduce gang activity and increase pathways for community safety and wellness. ","No comments","","","","","Cleanliness/trash collection","","Dumping in vacant lots and buildings, parks, in front of shuttered businesses, and at corner litter baskets is a rising problem throughout the community district. The dumping typically occurs late nights or in the early hours of the morning. It contributes to dirty sidewalks and rubbish around the community. The district's low sanitation cleanliness scores confirm the neighborhood's struggles and highlight a need for more enforcement. Without adequate enforcement covering multiple shifts the problem will persist.","No comments","Illegal dumping is a major community concern. From parks to MTA stations and bus stops, to corner baskets, dumpers abuse the neighborhood and beset their waste on the whole community. We need greater enforcement against violators to change behaviors around dumping in Bedford-Stuyvesant. ","","","","","Affordable housing creation","","The development of several parcels of land in the southeastern quadrant of Bedford-Stuyvesant, particularly on Fulton Street and Saratoga Avenue is crucial to the district, and we know that there are ongoing discussions regarding those parcels of land with HPD. The development of this land is an opportunity to create senior and affordable housing for the working people of Bedford Stuyvesant who are having a hard time finding affordable housing to raise their families in. A Community facility, startup incubator & general office space, a full service bank and a FRESH market can also be located within the new development. This development is an opportunity to incorporate sustainable features and practices in a mixed-use development project within Bedford Stuyvesant.      A study to assess the need and impact of active manufacturing in northern sections of Bedford-Stuyvesant including clear opportunities to either the attraction of industrial manufacturing and/or the protection of areas for manufacturing should be identified. Additionally the study should include an assessment for the attraction of a green industry cluster appropriate and contextual to the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood.","No comments","No comments","Community Board 3 encompasses a vast area with diverse needs. In the past decade, Bedford-Stuyvesant has seen a significant uptick in start-up businesses and businesses moving to the area, yet many are forced to shutter due to high commercial rents. We know that a thriving community is one where small business can grow and be sustained. We need particular attention to small business development along our secondary commercial corridors, which serves portions resident without easy access to Fulton Street.  In addition, affordable homeownership remains a major obstacle in Bedford Stuyvesant. Studies show that the homeownership is the hallmark of a stable community. Rising home costs is making homeownership less achievable for many residents each day. Many long-time Bedford Stuyvesant residents find themselves unable to afford or maintain their homes, leaving them susceptible to foreclosure or unethical investors. These efforts disrupt the community's cohesion. ","","","","","Traffic safety and enforcement (cars, scooters, ebikes, etc.)","","Traffic enforcement is lack throughout the community, creating more dangerous roadways for all users - pedestrians, cyclists, bus operators, and other uses.   Streets are jammed with traffic and motorists often double park or blocking bus stops and fire hydrants. We need better enforcement improve safety for all.","The Broadway corridor is in poor condition and needs significant upgrades. The roadway is dilipadated and the street design is unsafe.  Our district also have significant congestion issues on Fulton Street, Myrtle Avenue, Bedford Avenue, and Atlantic Avenue. Addiitionally there are deep issues at the Classon Avenue on-ramp to the BQE and Tompkins Avenue during the afternoon rush. ","As the City diversifies transit options, its critical the community-level engagement and participation are involved at every level. Our streets landscape is changing but those changes should include input, feedback, and recommendations from the widest swath of users. Data supporting changes, at the community board level, should be prioritized and shared with constituents.  ","","","","","Quality of parks and park facilities","","As a community we continue to advocate for the better parks and playgrounds. Parks have always assisted our community in child development, community engagement through family events, physical activities, and a resource for our educators and their students.  There are several assets in our district that require capital funding and would make significant impact on the quality of the parks. Spaces are being used for a variety of activities as more and more people are using the outdoors as extension of their homes. There are neighborhood green spaces which contend with the challenge of their surroundings, such as NYCHA playgrounds. These spaces present unique opportunities and challenges; although the community would benefit from programming such as ‘Parks without Borders’ it leaves residents vulnerable even if that program encourages social engagement.   Our parks also need to be better equipped to deal with the changing climate. The recent extreme weather magnified the need in Bedford-Stuyvesant for more green infrastructure to go along with improved catch basin and drainage systems,  There are still has several asphalt covered play yards and street extensions where greenery can be integrated. ","No comments","Cultural assets within the community need to be supported and maintained. Institutions like the Magnolia Tree Earth Center should be part of the city's cultural institutions group so that it could have access to sustainable funding streams.   Bedford-Stuyvesant is a cultural center and culture is a driver for the local economy. A neighborhood cultural plan would help identify gaps in resources, areas of saturation, and ways to leverage cultural capital for greater good.  ","","The community board need greater investment to meet the breadth of community needs. Our office need access and training in hardware and software resources that aid in informaiton sharing with diverse constituences. The board needs access to facilities that can host meetings in that prioritize public health and have audio-visual capacity that allow for hybrid meetings.

The borders remain the same despite the recent surge in the neighborhood's popularity leading to associations with parts of Williamsburg, Bed-Stuy, and Queens. Community Board 4 continues to represent Bushwick and advocate for initiatives and opportunities that will improve the quality of life for all. In preparing this year's statement, it is important to note several factors, in no particular order, that guide our selections and responses.    	The current migrant crisis 	Frequent weather events and flooding 	The preexisting housing crisis 	The lingering impact of the COVID-19 pandemic 	The ongoing pressures of gentrification  	A history of public and private disinvestment.   The current migrant crisis not only poses a long-term impact to the city's budget, it affects local service delivery and the overall quality of life. The community board was not involved and often remains disconnected from larger decisions as it relates to the migrant shelter within the district that opened in spring 2023. The lack of inclusion and responsiveness continues despite the board's district office receiving a high volume of concerns and regularly referring them ot the NYC Department of Housing, Preservation, and Development for agency oversight.  Forecasts for rain that previously warranted flooding prevention from the coastal areas of the city now impact inland commercial and residential corridors along Knickerbocker Avenue and Wilson Avenue. Businesses, small homeowners, and public housing tenants continue to be at-risk of storm damage and/or loss of building/services. Many New Yorkers remain at-risk of housing displacement as the cost-of-living increases and the real estate market becomes more competitive. Studies show that neighborhoods with a large immigrant and minority population, such as Bushwick were hit the hardest by the COVID-19 pandemic. Families and individuals were suddenly without work, relying on unemployment, or essential workers required to work in public-facing positions. Food insecurity spiked incentivizing new government programs and mutual aid groups to bridge the gap. The demand for food still remains as many households rely on food pantries to sustain themselves and their families.   The ongoing pressures of gentrification briefly lulled in 2020, as more renters were increasingly unable to pay rent, new construction was paused, and the pandemic deterred most from leaving their homes, and, at times, even required they shelter in place. As we reemerge, there are significant challenges ahead, especially for the most vulnerable. Despite the influx of new residents and increased economic activity in the neighborhood, barriers still exist for many Black, Brown, and working-class families and individuals in Bushwick. Agencies with priorities largely governed by the current Mayoral administration have an opportunity to elevate community goals and further build constructive relationships. However, many remain absent or have had a diminished presence since the half-decade community planning process stalled in early 2019.  Community Board 4 continues to encourage and support collaborative efforts among agencies government agency partners, organizations, and local stakeholders to address racial, economic, and social inequity in Bushwick. During summer and fall 2023, the board's office built on previous efforts to increase community engagement and participation with the statement of community district needs and budget request process. Those efforts included relaunching the annual district needs survey and organizing the second district needs town hall meeting. The results of both will be partially reflected in this statement as well as a separate report. We are grateful for the support of the community and look forward to improving these efforts in the years to come.  Robert Camacho, Chairperson                    Celestina León, District Manager ","","","","","Affordable Housing","","As Bushwick continues to evolve and grow in demand, the affordability of residential and commercial units has steeply declined compared to the average rent in the 2010s. Many of the immigrant (South and Central American and Caribbean) and longer-term migrant (African American and Caribbean) families and individuals primarily of color have been displaced from the neighborhood due to rent hardship, tenant harassment, and the overall increase in the cost of living. New construction continues at a steady pace despite a brief pause during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Bushwick’s transit rich options have only reinforced its desirability and development potential as the city experiences an overall strong economy.   A majority of residents are either forced to double up or overcrowd units to cover the rent or, more prevalently, choose to share private apartments that are typically and informally rented by room. Additionally, for the latter, private management and real estate companies often cater to young urban professionals in these situations that are either working or rely on a guarantor to cover their expenses. This has led to a noticeable increase in transient, room-sharing residences that are priced much higher than the units previously occupied by families with potentially one of two income earners.  Yet a subset of small property owners that invested in the neighborhood during economically challenging times remain; however, they continue to face aggressive tactics from those looking to acquire new properties and benefit from the increase in demand. It is commonplace for individuals and companies to actively target homeowners and persuade them to sell their properties via persistent mail campaigns, door-to-door canvassing, phone calls, etc. As some homeowners age, move, or pass away, properties are potentially abandoned, mismanaged, and end up in foreclosure furthering a cycle of decline and creating opportunities for developers seeking to profit off of Bushwick’s burgeoning popularity.  Despite the community board’s and larger community efforts to implement the Bushwick Community Plan in partnership with the Mayor’s Administration to preserve the neighborhood’s character and intentionally guide development, conversations stalled due to a difference in visions just before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The concerns and fears that incited the community plan process, were tragically realized within the past decade and persist as Bushwick’s current blanket zoning (est. 1961) legally permits developments that are out-of-character with surrounding buildings due to a vastly outdated incentive. Once again demonstrating that government inaction is a two-sided sword that disproportionately impacts communities of color and actively works against racial equity.   Upon reflection of this reality, it is clear that additional support from agency partners, such as the NYC Department of Housing, Preservation, and Development, is actively needed to further neighborhood goals. Processes in other neighborhoods similar to Bushwick have been met with a range of success, although ultimately create both a framework and foundation to empower community members.  What was once a neighborhood rich in history continues to visibly erode (see Broadway and Bushwick Avenue) as even historic properties lacking the protection of landmark designation status are demolished. These properties, once the homes of the German brewery owners, explorers, doctors, and even a New York City mayor, typically sit on larger than average-sized lots and are purchased for redevelopment to make way for profit in the form of new and taller buildings with smaller units that are typically unaffordable to the Black and Brown working families and individuals that helped Bushwick rise from the ashes of turmoil in the late nineteenth century.	  Deeply and sustainably affordable housing remains one of the greatest needs of the community. The current Area Median Income (AMI) far exceeds the average income of Bushwick households, which historically encompassed a range from extremely low to moderate income. Within the past several years, the average “affordable” city lottery apartment is accessible to only those at 130% AMI (insert numbers from fact sheet). The word affordable is a trigger within the community, resulting often in the response for whom? Unless developers take a community approach to their projects, their buildings only further displacement by excluding opportunities for low and extremely low-income households in Bushwick. ","Infrastructure resiliency","","Forecasts for rain that previously warranted flooding prevention from the coastal areas of the city now significantly impact inland commercial and residential corridors along Knickerbocker Avenue and Wilson Avenue. Businesses, small homeowners, and public housing tenants continue to be at-risk of storm damage and/or loss of building/services. Support for and enhancement of  preexisting infrastructure impacted by storms is needed along with investment in new types of resiliency infrastructure to address more frequent street and building flooding conditions. ","Land use trends","","As previously referenced in the section on Affordability, in 2013, the board's Housing and Land Use Committee drafted a letter to local elected officials that resulted in the Bushwick Community Plan. The plan, a culmination of an unprecedentedly comprehensive and collaborative effort, was released in September 2018. Multiple rounds of community engagement were coordinated to simultaneously address the desire for neighborhood preservation and the creation of affordable housing along with other various community needs. The rezoning and the resulting recommendations were unfortunately stalled in early 2020 due to differing visions (see City Planning's The Bushwick Neighborhood Plan) for the neighborhood's future. The previous mayoral administration labeled the community's plan a downzoning shortly before the pandemic suddenly and swiftly shifted citywide priorities. The process, also unprecedented in terms of partnership between city agencies, local stakeholders, and residents, endeavored to create and implement a truly community-led plan that would modernize Bushwick’s zoning and bring much needed public investments to the entire neighborhood.   Aspects of the plan, specifically the rezoning of manufacturing sites for other uses, remain a source of contention along with the lack of restrictions and accountability in the ULURP process.  The majority of Bushwick remains blanketed with the R6 zoning designation, allowing developers to construct buildings and other edifices as-of-right that are typically non-conforming in height and non-contextual to other buildings in the area. The rents in these buildings are typically priced at or above the market rate, even when the developer seeks government subsidies and incentives. Most of the new housing developed in the neighborhood is out of reach for longtime residents as rents continue to rebound from the pandemic and increase and/or unit composition fails to meet their household's needs. 	  These pressures have spread to longtime and new commercial establishments that are gradually priced out of their locations. Commercial rents are often out of reach for small, independent business owners. Vacant storefronts are common, as property owners opt to wait for higher paying tenants. Additionally, the legal conversion of manufacturing spaces to commercial continues to change the neighborhood’s landscape leading to new service challenges, as the properties were originally designed for manufacturing purposes. These challenges are compounded by an evolving culture that often adversely impacts the quality of life in the neighboring residential areas.  In 2023, the Adams' administration via City Planning began the review and notification process for the City of Yes zoning text amendments for carbon neutrality, economic opportunity, and housing. The amendments propose sweeping citywide changes that will impact NYC's neighborhoods, like Bushwick, in a myriad of ways. The board's review of the Zoning for Economic Opportunity text amendment is slated for fall 2023 and the review of the Zoning for Housing opportunity text amendment will follow in 2024.","","","","","Access to healthy food and lifestyle programs","","In previous years, chronic diseases prevention and management was the most important issue in Bushwick under the health umbrella. The onset of the pandemic in March 2020 and surge in unemployment led to a sharp increase in the number of families and individuals that relied on local food pantries, mutual aid efforts, and city programs for food.  Despite renewed economic investment in the neighborhood, accessibility and more specifically the affordability of fresh and health food remains limited. Efforts to address this have been made most noticeably via the Shop Healthy NYC program however, additional support is needed.  The Bushwick Health Center (335 Central Avenue) remains elusive in the neighborhood and is not featured on the NYC Health website as a resource for Bushwick locals and visitors. Community Board 4 leadership has connected with agency leadership to address this, although it's clear that the center must be prioritized on a higher level to receive the investment needed for it to become a true community asset.  The following round out the top five most important neighborhood issues: - Environmental health issues (noise, lead, respiratory illness, moisture, mildew, mold, etc.) - Services and communication for New Yorkers who are homebound/have disabilities - Services to reduce or prevent homelessness.","Community Board 4 is grateful for the work and support of our partners at Wyckoff Heights Medical Center and Woodhull Hospital, as well as, the local community based organizations and other service providers taking the lead to address systemic health disparities. It remains vital to continue and enhance the educational outreach efforts that help connect community members to the resources they need to lead healthy lives. Additionally, an increase in neighborhood construction, transient populations, and frequent business turnover has further exacerbated environmental health issues, such as asthma, more garbage, and larger rodent populations.  The staging conditions at construction sites and vacant lots have become havens for the rodent population and attract chronic illegal dumping and drop off issues. These realities and the resulting challenges require a multi-agency approach to address the source of the issue before they impact neighboring properties and the general public. ","Community Board 4 has historically prioritized requests for funding senior services. As the general population lives longer, additional services are needed to meet the increasing population and ever-changing needs. Many seniors are faced with declining mental and physical health, resulting from, but not limited to loneliness, abandonment, and other healthcare issues. Senior property owners are often the most vulnerable when it comes to issues such as deed fraud, home repairs, and maintenance services, as some do not have access to professional advocates and rely on a fixed income. Fortunately, programming and initiatives for the issues described above exist and should be regularly promoted through strategic partnerships with facilities for seniors and other local community partners. ","Households citywide have been affected by the housing crisis and many of them are facing uncertainty, which was further exacerbated by the pandemic. Longtime Bushwick residents, in particular, continue to face the dual adversities of rent increases and poor building maintenance. A record number of families are living in city shelters and often end up far from home. Single adults are faced with the harrowing choice of street homelessness or an uncertain shelter environment that may worsen their overall circumstances. Regular street outreach and strategic community collaborations are necessary to reach homeless and at-risk populations. ","No comments","","","","","Educational attainment","","As the city and larger economy continue to evolve, it is evident that access to a quality education, vocational programs, trade schools, and professional development opportunities are essential to financial stability and general quality of life. From youth to older adults, educational attainment often determines profession and/or future employment opportunities and the corresponding income. With a higher cost of living many low-income and vulnerable families and individuals struggle to afford and meet their basic needs. Access to more dynamic educational and workforce development programming would potentially offset some of these challenges.   The following round out the top five most important neighborhood issues: - After school programs - Support services for special needs youth (disabled, immigrant, non-English proficient, etc.) - Remote learning and technology - Schools and educational facilities (Maintenance)","Community Board 4 continues to work with school leadership, learning centers, and community institutions, such as Community Education Council 32, that provide educational services and support, as well as, advocate for the needs of the community. We are appreciative of all efforts to invest in the renovation and upgrading of schools. Given the evolving educational atmosphere and technology, all students and youth in Bushwick need equitable access to quality learning equipment and materials necessary for them to build the skills they need to thrive in the modern world. The COVID-19 pandemic further highlighted inequity in Bushwick, as District 32 leadership adapted to a series of new normals and stepped up to support the school community during a time of great need. ","No comments","","","","","Police-community relations","","As Bushwick continues to experience rapid and multivariate change due to gentrification, there is a need for adaptable and culturally-sensitive police-community relations. Bushwick stakeholders have worked across generations to strengthen and improve the neighborhood's relations with the 83rd Precinct, Patrol Borough Brooklyn North, and the NYPD at large. With an increasing volume of service complaints despite a decrease in major crimes, greater transparency, efficiency, and visibility are needed to meet the needs of the various communities that constitute the entirety of Bushwick.  The following round out the top five most important neighborhood issues: - General crime - Crime prevention programs - Emergency and disaster preparedness - Traffic violations and enforcement","Community Board 4 continues to work with the 83rd Precinct, the Precinct Community and Clergy Councils, and residents to help address the safety needs of the neighborhood. Despite a historic decrease in crime citywide and within Bushwick, it is still a reality of city life. As the city continues to recover from the pandemic and respond to broader social issues, including law enforcement reform, it is critical that local communities are a part of the conversation. We look forward to advocating in partnership for the resources needed to address the most common public safety issues in the neighborhood, such as burglaries and grand larcenies, as well as, furthering racial and social justice advocacy efforts in partnership with the NYPD and Bushwick community at large. ","No comments","","","","","Sewer capacity","","Street and building flooding are a more frequent occurrences during rain events as the current infrastructure no longer supports the demand on the system. Investment in both capital reconstruction projects and alternative, shorter-term solutions are needed to safeguard against and prevent costly property damage. The Department of Environmental protection remains an accessible partner in response to flooding issues within the district and preparing for storms in advance however, further support and collaborative strategies are needed to address issues on a larger level. Local elected officials have also demonstrated consistent leadership to address water runoff and flooding conditions by hosting flood prevention workshops and other weather-related events.","See budget requests. ","Historically, neglected vacant lots full of garbage and abandoned vehicles were a major issue in Bushwick and remain an issue in the present, although to a lesser degree. During the 70s and 80s, the board's Sanitation Committee was one of the three largest committees. Presently, there are fewer lots due to an increase in development however, garbage and debris from abandoned properties, new construction, and illegal dumping have become a regular and unsightly occurrence. All residents in proximity to these sites typically experience a higher volume of quality of life and public safety issues. Community Board 4 is grateful for the support of the local Brooklyn 4 Garage in addressing these issues. ","","","","","Affordable housing creation","","Truly affordable housing remains one of the greatest needs in Bushwick. Only a small number of buildings in the district are rent-stabilized and the tenants within those buildings are subject to aggressive harassment tactics as some landlords attempt to achieve vacancy decontrol. The current Area Median Income (AMI) far exceeds the average income of Bushwick households, which encompasses a range of extremely low- to moderate-income. The word affordable has become a trigger within the community, resulting often in the response, for whom? Unless developers take a community approach to their projects, their buildings often exclude low- and extremely low-income families and individuals. This has led to rampant displacement and an increase in homelessness. All types of households continue to pay over fifty percent of their income in rent.    Additionally, there are fewer opportunities for affordable home ownership as the housing market is largely inaccessible to low- and middle- income New Yorkers and barriers and availability impact the accessibility of government-subsidized projects.  The following round out the top five most important neighborhood issues: - Land use and zoning - Housing support services for homeowners  - Affordable housing preservation - Commercial district revitalization","See Most Pressing Issues - Land Use Trends. ","See budget requests. ","See budget requests. ","","","","","Traffic safety and enforcement (cars, scooters, ebikes, etc.)","","Initiatives, such as Vision Zero, have served as a conduit to address some of Bushwick’s transit infrastructure and safety needs through much needed safety upgrades and the implementation of other strategic traffic calming measures, such as the Myrtle-Wyckoff pedestrian plaza. Additional studies are needed to address aging infrastructure, an increase in population density, and safety issues on the busiest corridors in the neighborhood, including Broadway, Bushwick Avenue, Knickerbocker Avenue, Myrtle Avenue, and Wyckoff Avenue. All corridors experience a high volume of mixed-use traffic (pedestrian, cyclist, vehicular, etc.). They remain in great need of additional investment, ranging from resurfacing to the implementation of traffic calming measures.  During spring and summer 2021, Community Board 4 in partnership with New York City Land Use conducted a traffic safety study along Bushwick Avenue noting key intersections of concern along with recommendations for improvements. This project was possible with the support of Council Member Antonio Reynoso and Council Member Darma Diaz.  The following round out the top five most important neighborhood issues: - Pedestrian safety - Street lighting - Traffic congestion - Open space & street activation","See budget requests. ","See budget requests. ","","","","","Park care and maintenance","","Our parks are centers of interaction with neighbors and nature. They are also conduits for a variety of activities and opportunities within the neighborhood for individuals and families. At the most basic level they help filter the air and surrounding environment. It is for those reasons and beyond, that it remains vital to prioritize their upkeep and necessary renovations. In the past several years, an increasing number of homeless individuals have sought shelter in local parks. There is visible drug use and paraphernalia on park benches, bushes, and play areas along with other general public safety issues. Limited park maintenance capacity and public safety issues remain common complaints. We are thankful for the partnership and support from the NYC Parks Brooklyn Borough Commissioner’s office and the local park manager in addressing situations as they arise.  The following round out the top five most important neighborhood issues: - Street tree and forestry services, including street tree maintenance - Park safety - Landmarks, monuments, sites of cultural significance - Community board resources*  *Community Board operations and administration are significantly impacted by transitions within other offices and agencies that are charter-mandated to support the boards, as well as susceptible to the loss of institutional knowledge.  ","See budget requests. ","Bushwick is known for its rich cultural diversity and arts community. Over the years, the cultures and artistic expression have changed, although the spirit of creativity remains and has contributed to the large increase in new residents and visitors from all over the world. Despite the neighborhood's increase in popularity, work is still needed to connect youth, seniors, and local stakeholders to opportunities for enrichment and skills building. The arts remain a conduit to many pathways, including but not limited to, employment, outlets for expression, and strengthening community ties. ","See budget requests. ","Community Boards are tasked with monitoring and informing the delivery of city services in partnership with city agencies and elected officials. In order to build on this work, additional support is needed as outlined in the Future of Community Boards working group report. As the smallest city and most local agencies, community boards generally have three to four employees and limited personnel services funding. This hinders their ability to pursue and retain staff to serve evolving district populations and needs. ","","","","","Explanation","","","","","","","","","","BK4","","","","","","","","","","",""

This unique community is situated between Jamaica Avenue to the North and Jamaica Bay to the South; and is bordered to the west by Van Sinderen and Williams Avenues; and to the east by Eldert Lane and 78th Street. East New York is a community that is rich and deeply rooted in history and currently undergoing one of the most intense landscape transformations across the city with the implementation of the East New York Neighborhood Plan (ENY Rezone). The district has been identified as the premier community for New York City's vision for future development through the Mandatory Inclusionary Housing and Zoning for Quality and Affordability, which was voted up in previous administration of the New York City Council in 2016.    (a) Under the new MIH and ZQA implementations - the construction of taller buildings in denser neighborhoods is allowed with the mandate that developers set aside a certain portion of ""affordable"" housing units in new developments. Brooklyn's Community Board 5 is ever-growing in its uniquely fascinating history with the discovery of one of New York City's recognized African Burial Grounds, in the New Lots section of the district. In 2013, NYC Council Member Charles Barron, submitted the CB5 approved street co-naming for the ""African Burial Ground Square"" which covers the four-block radius of New Lots Avenue, Schenck Avenue, Livonia Avenue and Barbey Street. Today, the work continues with capital funding allocations from then NYS Assembly Member Charles Barron, and previous NYC Council Member Inez Barron for the renovation and renaming of the adjacent Sankofa Playground - formerly known as Schenck Playground.  This was the result of the excavation process with the NYC Department of Parks and Recreation, that later confirmed remains of enslaved Africans who worked and died on those very grounds. Sankofa Playground received a multi-million-dollar capital allocation along with the adjacent New Lots Library, which received close to $33 million for a complete gut renovation.  These investments will bring forth one of the most culturally relevant projects in our district and CB5 is extremely proud to have the partnership and support of the Assembly Member, Council Member, and the creative teams of Brooklyn Parks, and Brooklyn Public Library. Brooklyn, Community Board 5 also houses one of the largest retail expansions in New York City - the Gateway Center Mall - Phase II, covering over 600,000 sf in the Spring Creek area. The expansion of the Gateway Center mall helped to realize one of the most important Community Benefits Agreements (CBA) in East New York's recent history. Through the implementation of the CBA, Man Up! Inc. and the newly formed East New York Restoration Local Development Corporation worked collaboratively to provide employment open houses for the retail giants and helped to secure over 1,200 jobs for residents which included the pre and post-construction opportunities through the project labor agreement. Community Board 5 also houses two of the largest Industrial Business parks in the city - the East New York and Fairfield / Flatlands industrial business zones. There are hundreds of businesses within the two industrial areas stretching about 40 blocks. This is an area that currently requires greater community connection as it relates to MWBEs within the parks as well as an increase in the local hire percentage. The district is also home to twelve NYCHA developments which provide affordable housing for thousands of ENY residents.  It is one of the most important housing stocks in the district and we will continue to fight for greater investments in maintenance, back-logged repairs, quality heating systems, recycling education, and overall improvement with bulk trash removal.   CB5 also has four amazing Brooklyn Public Library branches - Arlington, Cypress Hills, Spring Creek and of course the New Lots branch which is slated to receive the complete overhaul.  We continue to encourage residents of the district to take full advantage of these wonderful institutions. Community Board 5 also houses all the public schools within School District 19, and we have over 50 sites hosting students from Pre-K through 12th grade.  We are also extremely pleased that the newly constructed, 1000 seat school, P.S. 938 opened its doors in the 2020-2021 school year.   P.S. 938 currently houses students from Pre-K/3K through 2nd grade and growing.  CB5 also has beautifully constructed religious institutions of various faiths; delicious eateries in every section; and community-based organizations that provide invaluable services to thousands of children, families, and businesses across the city.  Moreover, in July 2020, the long-awaited opening of New York City's largest state park took place - the Shirley Chisholm State Park, off the Pennsylvania Avenue exit on the Belt Parkway.  This was the former landfill site that was completely transformed into a beautiful open park space that now boasts a bike library, beautiful walkways and another open space for the families of the East New York Community.  Additionally, over the past decade, the district has had one of the fastest growing populations in the city, with an increasing African American demographic. According to the 2015 Neighborhood Health Profile for Community District 5, the population is made up of 52% Black (non-Hispanic); 37% Hispanic; 6% Asian; 3% White; and 2% Other. The district has also become home to one of the largest Bangladeshi populations across the city, with a high percentage of the residents in the City Line neighborhood, migrating from Bangladesh. The people of this district are just as unique as the neighborhoods in which they live.  In that regard, it is the aim of Brooklyn, Community Board 5 to fight for the very basic quality of life needs that will improve the lives of our residents.  Those very basic needs include - consistent maintenance within our housing developments (both public and private); greater access to healthy and fresh food choices; district-wide education on preventive health care and healthy living methods; mixed use development projects that include long-term community wide benefits; living wage employment; dedicated funding for cultural community facilities; quality and competitive education for our children; clean and well-maintained streets; necessary upgrades and improvements to sub-street level flooding regions; and an infusion of financial support for small businesses and community based organizations. The East New York Rezoning Plan continues to be a topic of discussion as city commitments are monitored and re-evaluated. Through the plan, East New York is slated to receive $267 million in capital investments with direct support for the renovation and upgrade of existing housing and construction of new affordable housing units; small business growth and development; roadway repairs and upgrades; new educational and community facilities, and much more. Here is an outline of some of the key components outlined in the East New York Plan: 1200 units of new affordable housing including senior and supportive housing • Eviction prevention support through the Tenant Support Unit • Homeowner Helpdesk which provides direct financial and legal counseling for homeowners • Up to $15,000 for first time homeowners with the Home First Down Payment Assistance Program • Renovations and upgrades to public parks spaces, including the most recent renovation of City Line Park • Repairs and renovations to the historic PAL building at 127 Pennsylvania Avenue which has served as the home base for Brooklyn, Community Board 5 for 40 years.  The building now offers programming for families of East New York from the Child Center of NY and Youth Strategies Division of NYPD • Activation of a Community NYC Retrofit program to encourage smaller housing buildings to participate in the Green Housing Preservation Program • The East New York Workforce 1 center which provides direct access to employment opportunities and training, located on Atlantic Avenue • Support for commercial corridors and other small businesses throughout the district • A new 1000 seat educational facility for elementary and middle school-aged children next to the Chestnut Commons development site • Technological and structural upgrades to East New York's Industrial Business Zones • Wi-Fi access on many commercial corridors and LINK NYC activated kiosks.   These are some of the wonderfully creative strategies that were connected to the written plan.  In that regard, we will continue to aggressively advocate to newly elected Mayor Adams, our local elected officials and the commissioners of our city agencies, for the very basic quality of life needs that this community deserves and to ensure that those vital commitments outlined in the plan come to fruition.  Let's work together to make sure that Brooklyn, Community Board 5 becomes an even greater community to Live, Work, and Thrive!

Developers have started a ""trend"" with incorporating these programs, services, and dedicated units in projects slated for CB5; under the label of supportive housing.    Supportive Housing has become the ""go to"" option for developers in their quest to receive financial incentives and other government subsidies, when building in our community.  Subsequently, the district is now oversaturated with supportive housing units that are crammed in specific sections of the district.    For example, the following large multi-family developments are all within 1 mile of each other and each has dedicated supportive housing units for developmentally disabled residents: Gateway Elton - 659 units Fountain Seaview - 604 Nehemiah - 320  The need for creating opportunities for individuals who are transitioning into independent living is something that has to be done, however it is detrimental to compact those units into one area of any district.  Quality, affordable housing should always be inclusive for all New Yorkers while remaining fair in its distribution of supportive units across the city.    POTENTIAL SOLUTION:  With the influx of temporary housing and various substance abuse sites in CB5, we are requesting that the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, NYC Department of Homeless Services, and NYC Housing Preservation Department collectively support the need to expand the concept of supportive housing to include other categories of individuals who are at a disadvantage in securing permanent housing.  These new categories of supportive housing, if recognized by the city, would still allow for incentives for developers when including the new supportive housing in their projects.    We are requesting a study be conducted of the construction of supportive housing and of hotels being contracted for shelter use in Brooklyn, Community Board 5 (from 2010 through 2022) to identify and substantiate oversaturation.   This study should outline the long-term solutions to mitigating adverse effects of the oversaturation and the remedy to non-compliance of the Fair Share Act - such as:  greater investment in overall affordable housing; accessible resources and financial support for increasing long-term homeownership; eventual ceasing of city agency contracts with commercial hotels for temporary shelter/housing; incentives for existing hotel site conversion to permanent ownership housing, and permanent law and/or policy with obvious penalty for implementing temporary shelter in areas that would result in oversaturation or the breach of the Fair Share Act.","Trash removal and cleanliness","","Bulk trash collection and dumping in specific areas of the district have long been an issue in Brooklyn Community Board 5. However, under the budget restraints and decrease of services, it has become one of the districts major concerns.    Not only has it been an issue with the basic trash collection in key sites like our NYCHA developments, but now there are ""trash hot-spots"" in the district.  There are areas where the illegal dumping and bulk trash has become overbearing to residents throughout the district.  People are dropping off bulk items in gardens, vacant land sites, and in areas of the district that are poorly lit.  Additionally there are areas, in particular, the Industrial Business zones and BID areas where the lack of service and monitoring has created an environment that invites illegal activity on top of the dumping.  Many community members, civic groups, and associations have taken up the cause to do community clean ups on blocks and in parks, but these selfless community acts are just to address the accumulation of trash under COVID; they are by no means a solution to the overall issue.  POTENTIAL SOLUTION:  The issue of trash and the consequences of it, such as fostering the development of rats and rodents which have an extremely high reproduction multiplier, require us to deploy all of the City’s tools.  In particular in the high need mixed-use areas of: Fulton St, Pitkin Ave, Pennsylvania Ave, New Lots Ave, and Livonia Ave, as well as the Industrial Business Zones, jurisdictionally dubious areas such as along the intersection of the Conduit and Atlantic Ave (a particular issue that the Mayor’s “Get Stuff Clean” initiative is trying to tackle), and other high need residential areas. These areas require a comprehensive three-pronged approach that 1) Provides sustained educational outreach to nearby residents Enforcement 2) Strengthens Enforcement and 3) Strengthens mitigating public street infrastructure (such as containerized waste products which we know the City is currently undergoing a study on and is still under the ‘piloting phase’ until those stud results are released). Educational outreach will allow residents and neighborhood actors to gain explicit information as to how to prevent rodent and rat infestation and can allow for further education through programs such as the Rat Academy.   Additionally, with the increase of population in the district due to the expansion of two and three bedroom housing and slated one and two family homes under development, we need to be designated as a Tri-Day Pick Up zone.   DSNY could also use its special enforcement cameras and collaborate with DOT to install additional lighting, to catch dumpers, fine them, and deter further hot-spot dumping. Ideally, any educational outreach also accompanies installation or provision of new waste infrastructure such as containerized bins for both commercial businesses and residents. These bins must also be situated in specific portions of high-need areas in the corridors outlined above.           ","Other - Write In (Required)","","PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACT Brooklyn Community Board 5 has various public health concerns that directly impact the overall well being of our residents.  These concerns were highlighted during the pandemic and the immense disparities in resources and programming to address those concerns was further exposed.  One of the most pressing public health concerns that have negatively impacted our district, is the lack of access and affordability of healthy foods and healthy lifestyle programming.  CB5 continues to be a food desert or food swamp (an area where unhealthy food is more readily available than healthy food) as identified in the NYC Department of Health’s EpiData Brief titled “Access to Healthy and Affordable Food in ENY”.  This brief outlined the devastating fact that specifically in zip codes 11207 and 11208 (the largest populated neighborhoods in the district), bodegas and fast-food chains make up close to 80% of the direct food source for residents.  This screams inequality and food injustice.  Moreover, the brief also exposed that 11207 and 11208 residents are surrounded by 135 bodegas and 71 fast food chains that line the major through ways of the district.  For instance – Pennsylvania Avenue which is the connecting avenue from the Jackie Robinson Parkway to the Belt Parkway, is lined with the a number of the most prominent fast food chains in the nation – McDonalds, Burger King, Popeyes, White Castle, Checkers, Wendys, and more.  They are housed back-to-back along Pennsylvania Avenue from between Linden Boulevard and Wortman Avenue, which is a five minute walk to reach any one of them.   Brooklyn Community Board 5 has public health concerns that directly impact the overall well-being and longevity of its residents.  These concerns were highlighted  The obvious injustice lies in the fact that these fast-food conglomerates are all within a mile of three NYCHA developments housing over 3500 families, two senior centers, four youth community centers, and three schools.  This is a deliberate placement to attract the district’s most vulnerable populations.  Moreover, NYCHA developments and senior centers are where you will find the highest rates of diabetes, heart disease and cancer.  The schools, as a result, are filled with students who suffer from alarming rates of youth obesity, undiagnosed developmental disabilities, and the common thread of poverty and rent burden stresses.    POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS:  We are requesting monthly inspections from the NYC Department of Health & Mental Hygiene for all food establishments in the district, with an emphasis on bodega stores.  We are also requesting that the Shop Healthy program be re-ignited to complete the survey in the 11239 portion of the district as well as re-visit the bodegas that were surveyed in 11207 and 11208 to check on healthy food option improvements that were implemented.     Lastly, we request that the City issue a study of the specific area of Pennsylvania Avenue outlined above (which lies just south of Linden Blvd). This study should outline the public health consequences of having a high concentration of fast-food chain restaurants in a small area for East New Yorkers. The study should outline long-term solutions such as moving toward a path of fresh foods along that area via a purchase and transfer model by the city (eminent domain); such a model can also lead to potential development of residential housing, a need and public benefit that far outweighs the single layered commercial usage of today.     Excerpt:  Lack of access to healthy food can cause real health problems, according to Gina Lovasi, a Ph.D. and professor of Urban Health at Drexel University. “Access to fresh foods in particular is related to obesity and to other risk factors,” Lovasi said. “Hypertension and diabetes, which we know have consequences for cardiovascular disease risk, for some cancers and even some transmissible diseases such as COVID-19.”   Article Sources: https://citylimits.org/2018/05/21/new-york-citys-biggest-food-swamps/  https://pix11.com/news/created-equal/why-food-deserts-persist-in-low-income-nyc-neighborhoods/  https://swhelper.org/2019/12/11/an-overabundance-of-fast-food-food-swamps-are-the-new-food-deserts/ ","","","","","Access to healthy food and lifestyle programs","","In this new fiscal year, we still have a real need to address one of the most important factors in the lives of residents in CB5 and that is health and wellness.  Unfortunately, there has not been a great deal of movement toward making East New York a healthier and more health conscious community.  Under COVID, this was highlighted even further.  We still have a lack of access to quality and healthy foods.    1. We are requesting that the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, working in conjunction with the Brooklyn Borough President and the NYC Council, allocate the funding that can provide greater incentive programs for local businesses to invest in fresh produce and high quality healthy foods.   2. NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene conduct quarterly inspections in those food establishments, specifically bodegas and local supermarkets, to ensure that quality food and food products are being sold to the residents of the district. 3. Further the Shop Healthy Brooklyn study to include the food establishments in the 11239 section of the district.  We have a growing population in the neighborhood of Spring Creek and there are food establishments that should be educated on how they can better serve the district. 4. Support the connection between our local gardens and farmer's markets with local supermarkets and grocery stores.  Since more than half of the food establishments are bodegas and a high percentage are grocery stores - local gardens and the two farmer's markets that exist in CB5 should have a direct line to providing them with fresh fruits, vegetables, herbs, and breads.","According to the 2018 Neighborhood Health Profile for East New York, heart disease and cancer rank as the top two causes of death; with over 3,000 people fatally stricken from the diseases combined. These figures prove that a high percentage of our residents are living with illnesses that not only impact their physical abilities but also increases stress and hardship for the entire family. The direct results are hardships that permeate every fraction of physical and mental health. With greater access to healthier food and lifestyle programs we can increase life span, encourage healthier eating habits and lifestyle habits and lessen the percentage of residents who suffer from chronic illnesses, mental health challenges, potential homelessness, and the need for additional assisted living options. Additionally, the medical facilities that exist in the district must be infused with the expense and capital funding that allows for greater outreach efforts and updated facilities. CB5 has a variety of health facilities both under HHC and privately funded.  and medical centers in the district that are utilized by residents, when they become ill or to address specific health issuesT - however there is not enough general outreach conducted to encourage preventative measures, consistent health/wellness visits, and overall community health as a lifestyle.  Moreover, there is only one hospital, based in Brooklyn, Community Board 16, that services three community boards, and the zone hospital for residents in CB5.  Brookdale hospital was severely impacted, as most facilities, throughout the pandemic, which had a direct impact on the quality and frequency of services to the residents.  COVID-19 exposed the vulnerabilities in our commuity facilities and there is a serious need to ensure that adequate funding be allocated to improve services, healthy living and disease control programming, patient relations training for hospital and medical facility personnel, and most importantly, a financial focus on programs that bridge the gap between patients and healthy living practices.  Another major health concern in CB5 is violence and its impact on the community.  Homicide is amongst the top five causes of pre-mature death in the district.  One incident of violence, in particular gun violence, has the capacity to spread like a contagion.  The victim, the person committing the crime, their direct family members, and anyone who lives within that immediate area, feel the effects of the violence committed.  The impacts of gun shots or any violent act in a community, creates an environment of fear, anxiety, and shock  that has a negative health impact on the mind and body and an eventual breakdown on overall health. ","The Senior population in the community must be prioritized and provided with access to quality housing; fresh food and hot meals.  Additionally an increase in funding for activities that encourage longevity, flexibility and overall happiness are essential to the quality of life that is so very important to our elders.  Also, each Senior Center should be equipped with vehicles that provide shuttle services for events throughout the district and borough.  Far too often, there are programs, services, and events specific to our older adult populations, that are happening in other parts of the district or througout the city but seniors are not made aware and in some cases do not have the mobility and access to transportation.  Additionally, our elder population has the right to affordable and quality housing which can be accomodated in some of the newer developments in the district.  However, far too often developers choose to include ""supportive housing"" units instead to increase their opportunites for incentives in the overall cost for the project.  We are encouraging HPD and other housing agencies to increase the attraction of including senior specific units by providing greater incentives for senior housing in new construction projects. ","Community Board 5 has homeless housing and services that support families, as well as single women and men. Although the community has made a very clear statement about not wanting any new facilities that provide temporary shelter; we recognize the need to have each of these facilities equipped with adequate services, programming, and support to ensure that the transition into permanent housing exists in every way.  Far too often, loitering and quality of life complaints come into the office from neighboring businesses, organizations, libraries, and community residents near these facilities.  This can be directly attributed to the lack of resources and programming available to the residents of these facilites.  Funding should be provided to ensure hiqh quality services and programming for financial literacy, trainings/educational opportunities, housing assistance, and other resources.  In that regard, all DHS/DSS temporary housing facilities in CB5 should be surveyed and evaluated quarterly.  Additionally, the community deserves to have input on organizations that are chosen to provide services for the residents in shelter.  This agency, which will now hold a contract with the city for operations at the site, are chosen and then presented to the Board without input or inclusion in the selection process.  As it currently stands, the encouragement of input and participation is for Community Advisory Boards, which are formed after the organization is contracted to the facility.  Moreover, the decision to change the service designation of the facility should always include the community board.  Facilities that are changed into behavioral development sites directly impact the surrounding neighbors and businesses.  This is a decision that can have an overwhelmingly negative impact on a community and must be handled with complete transparency and inclusion. ","We have a mix income population  and all types of services are need.  We need training programs that will make our low income population work ready.","","","","","Other - Write In (Required)","","The neighborhoods within Brooklyn Community Board 5 are continuing to grow with large development projects that cater to 2, 3, and even 4 bedroom units.  This result is an increase in the population of children and families, yet the inclusion of adequate community space to accommodate this population is scarce.    The Community was given a false promise of a Boys Club that would be along the Livonia Avenue Corridor.  In fact, the inclusion of this much needed community space was one of the highlights of the RFP that was submitted by the Dunn Development.  It was one of the major components of the proposal that HPD boasted about and why the community was so willing to support the development overall.  However, once the project moved forward, the Boys Club was no longer a part of the design and the community was told that they were no longer going to receive a community center - although there were hundreds of new families moving into the corridor.  We are demanding that this space be designated for a viable cultural/community space and that it be designated as a sole source project for any potential housing that may be affiliated with the community space. ","Educational needs within the district are still at an all time high and it is our hope through this new administration, that the focus on permanent cultural curriculums, arts, music, and STEAM programming will be prioritized in both the expense and capital budgets of the NYC Department of Education.  We are pleased that our new K through 8 superintendent of School District 19, which encompasses all schools within Brooklyn, Community Board 5 is community centered and a champion for education, civic engagement, and overall youth empowerment.  We look to build on this momentum and our Board will continue to advocate and be a strong voice for qualitative and cultural education, safe academic environments, and capital investment that results in the highest levels of classroom technology; premier arts, music, and dance instruction; and state-of-the-art institutions.    Additionally, there is a need to provide a greater level of sensitivity towards educating student populations living in homelessness and/or temporary shelter.  With an increase in temporary shelters and two new family shelters coming into the district, school administrations must be provided with the necessary training, tools, and overall support to ensure that each student from this population is received with an ""open arms"" methodology of teaching.   ","Provide a list of all ACS Day Care sites that are currently under lease terms in CB5 with transparency of building owner and length of lease terms.    Request: Ensure that all leases signed for day care/child care facilities include the city’s option for right of first refusal – to safeguard facilities from being pushed out when owner wants to sell.  The lease terms should be standardized to include terms that allow for longevity of the facility and its services to children.","","","","","Crime prevention programs","","Continued violence and acts of violence in our communities is a true health epidemic.  A crime that is committed, not only has a direct impact on the person committing the crime and the victim, but it impacts the entire community.  Homicide is ranked within the top five causes of premature death in CB5.  It is a serious health epidemic and the only way to effectively address it, is to implement preventive measures.  Crime prevention programs are key to address the epidemic of violence that plagues our neighborhoods.       Programs that include the following:  • Street outreach teams that identify at-risk and high-risk members of the community  • Initiatives that work to engage these populations and provide long-term counseling and life coaching  • Workforce development component that assesses individuals’ employability and levels of education; and offers job readiness and placement; and educational referrals.  • An assigned team of Trained and Certified Mentors who will maintain the relationship during and after completion of the program.  These are actions that can work to prevent crime in neighborhoods and address violent behavior at its core.  Acts of violence are reactionary outburst that stem from a number of different issues; far too often in our neighborhoods violence is the result of concerns and issues that have been neglected and disregarded.  Crime Prevention Programs are definitely a way to increase the quality of life for residents of this community and break the cycles of violence that currently exist.   ","COMMUNITY POLICING: Community District 5 in Brooklyn is patrolled by the 75th precinct; which is one of the largest precinct areas in the city. It is for that very reason that crime prevention in this community has to be a multi-prong approach. The idea that policing alone, even at its finest, can effectively and consistently reduce crime is unrealistic. There have to be many components working together to have the most powerful and positive outcome. ""The magnitude of violence - in terms of the number of victims - makes it a serious health issue. But the effects of violence also ripple through a community, causing trauma to those who witness it or live in fear of it."" Excerpt: Cure Violence http://cureviolence.org/understand-violence/violence-as-a-health-issue/ POLICE PRESENCE: Policing measures are more effective when community has a strong input and involvement on how those measures are enforced and where the most need for those enforcements have been identified. Through the Commercial District Needs Assessment efforts from local development corporations in East New York, it was recognized that most small businesses along commercial corridors in the district, want to increase the police presence on the commercial strip. Assessments were completed from four commercial corridors in East New York and strip identified that an increased police presence along their corridors would help to improve their businesses. When merchants were asked what changes they needed to occur to bring more customers into their businesses - %25 of the merchants responded, which was the highest ranking response, with a need for more safety. East New York Brooklyn Commercial District Needs Assessment - NYC Department of Small Business Services / Avenue NYC http://www.nyc.gov/html/sbs/downloads/misc/cdna-eny/index.html ","Community District 5 has an increase in population due to the construction of thousands of units of housing.  With an increase of residents, there is of course an increase of potential fired hazards.  Each new development should be required to work with the local FDNY stations to implement annual Fire Safety Education workshops for all of the residents.  In addition residents should be offered the opportunity to become CPR certified or at minimum, any Resident Association, Building Captains, Resident Leadership, should be offered the CPR certification.  This is a great way to keep all residents educated on fire safety methods and decrease potential fire related incidence.","","","","","Cleanliness/trash collection","","East New York is a beautiful community filled with well maintained and new homes, beautifully constructed private and public housing developments, active commercial corridors, dynamic school buildings, thriving gardens and so much more - However consistent trash removal in and around all of these spaces has been a issue for many years.    In particular, in the public housing developments throughout the district, excessive amounts of bagged trash and bulk trash items are piled on side streets for days at a time.  In most cases, trash pile ups are literally lined on street blocks that encompass housing developments.  This is an immediate attack on the quality of life for residents of the developments as well as surrounding community members.  The amount of garbage and the amount of time it takes to collect it, has a direct impact on the increase of rodent and pest infestations in the development which also causes an increase in asthma and other health matters that are already prevalent in this district.  In addition, the aesthetic stimulates negative perception of and for the people of the community.  Mountains of trash left on sidewalks where thousands of families live, work and play daily is a complete disrespect and outright disregard for the community as a whole.      Businesses on some of the commercial corridors are also in dire need of  an increased focus from the city on trash clean up.  Instruction on how to discard trash and where to place it on the strip, has to be reiterated and enforced.  Additionally, the schedule of trash removal has to be adjusted to increase pick up times.  In the early stages of COVID-19, the illegal dumping complaints increased at an alarming rate.  Some areas of the district were targeted for dumping from outside businesses, and even some residents who took advantage of the pandemic's impact on city service agencies.  This resulted in areas of the district being swarmed with trash pile ups and bulk trash dumping.  The Industrial Business Zones were ideal for this illegal dumping activity because of the lack of lighting and minimal to no surrounding residences.    This also resulted in various CB5 led collaborations for community clean ups throughout the district.  Residents took matters into their own hands and began to act instead of just submitting complaints and CB5 requested local garage BK5 and DPR representatives for the district to support these efforts.  Various park sites and local blocks and strips were identified and community members worked together to make an impact on the trash pile ups.  Although the efforts of our residents and support of our local city agency reps were extremely noteworthy, we are still playing catch up in the district to address areas that were targeted.    ","Capital Projects in the district are not being prioritized within DEP. There are areas in the district that have capital projects pending for over 10 years and due to delays residents have been forced to endure flooding, standing water, and other measures that directly impact their quality of life.   Additionally, routine maintenance and upgrade work should be scheduled for all water mains, roadways, catch basins, and water supply systems in the district. Too many areas in the district receive emergency repair work on systems that are over due for maintenance and necessary upgrades.  Frequent updates on the 26th Ward Water Treatment Plant. ","Increase pick up schedules in NYCHA developments.  In some cases, multiple NYCHA developments run along the same strip which literally transforms the strip (blvd/street/avenue) into a strip of garbage.  A clear example is the fact that Louis H. Pink Houses, Cypress Houses, and Boulevard Houses all run along Linden Boulevard.  If the trash is not removed within those three developments, it creates an environment of air pollution, rodent attraction, limited walkway on the sidewalks and an overall disregard for quality of life for thousands of community members.    Increase trash pick-up schedules on commercial corridors in district:  • Sutter Avenue / between Van Sinderen and Pennsylvania Avenues  • Liberty Avenue / between Euclid Avenue and Forbell Street  • New Lots Avenue / between Van Sinderen Avenue and Elton Street  • Fulton Street / between    Large development is on the rise in CB5, and with that development comes an increase in families – which results in a larger amount of trash and recyclables that are put curbside for pick up.  Areas of the district that were never developed on, now have multi-level homes, and buildings that have over 500 units of housing.  The study for a tri-day pick up in CB5 needs to be conducted.     For reference, please research the following summarized list of new developments (completed or nearing completion) in the district within the last 5-10 years:      a. Gateway/Spring Creek Area which now encompasses:  Spring Creek Nehemiah   homes phases III & IV; Gateway Elton apartments with 9 buildings and 659 units - with new ground level commercial spaces     b. Livonia Avenue bet. Pennsylvania Avenue &  Van Sinderen which now encompasses:  Livonia Commons apartments and new ground level commercial spaces – 4 buildings with 288 units     c. Pitkin Avenue bet. Berriman Apartments – new development – 6 story building with 47 units     d. Redwood Senior – 81 units built on former NYCHA parking lot (Linden Houses)     e. Stanley Commons – 6 buildings with 240 units built on former NYCHA parking lot (Linden Houses)     f. Linden Boulevard and Emerald Street Apartments – new development which encompasses 4 buildings and 521 units.     g. Dinsmore Chestnut site – new development with over 200 units     h. Corretta Scott King Senior – 50 units     i. Belmont Gardens / Conduit Blvd & Eldert Lane – 67 units","","","","","Condition of public housing","","New York City Housing Authority is the largest public housing provider in the nation with developments that house people in every borough of the city.  Brooklyn, Community Board 5 houses 13 public housing developments that provide affordable housing for thousands of families and seniors.  Unfortunately, the conditions in these developments are still far below standard.  We have developments that have been under renovation and repair for many years.  Scaffolding shadows the exterior of buildings for years at a time with little to no progress on projects that were bidded and contracted.  Residents are forced to live in conditions including flooding, constant moisture on walls and ceilings, mold, holes, repeated plumbing issues, lack of hot water and heat, and so many other conditions that create and exacerbate deadly health conditions.  The amount of asthma and respiratory illness cases in NYCHA is higher than anywhere else in the district because of the amount of residents and the conditions that they live in.","","With East New York being the point of focus for the initial influx of development under the new MIH; it is necessary for development to include economic development as well as community development. New housing projects that come into the community should be mixed use with businesses as well as community space, as a ""Mandatory Inclusion"". Additionally, the City must make it more of a priority to invest their subsidies in affordable home ownership, similar to the Innovative Urban Village project.  (https://www.innovativeurbanvillage.com/)    With a growing non-profit community, the need for open community spaces throughout the district is a necessity and mixed use development affords the opportunity for further small business development as well as community based organizations to acquire one of the most vital assets to their success - space.  The Livonia Avenue corridor is a prime example of the city's missed opportunity to mandate community space in a large development project.  Initially the development of the corridor on Livonia included a lot dedicated to the Boys Club of NY - however when they failed to raise adequate funding - the lot remained empty while 278 units of housing were constructed and opened to new familes.  Although there were three initial ground floor commercial spaces that provided ""family resources"", they resources were limited and specific, whereas a ""Boys Club"" would have provided a full center for recreational programming, public swimming pool, and athletics.  It has been over 10 years and the lot remains empty while hundreds of children and families now live on the corridor.  Open Community Space in larger development projects must be mandated and incentivized to encourage developers to invest in them.  Affordable housing is just the first step in building healthy, thriving communities.  Create an addendum for all RFPs, RFQs, etc. - to include community board comment/suggestion. Currently community boards are not included and therefore the full proposal lacks the voice of the community in which the proposed project will exist. Given the recent re-zoning and influx of housing development - CB5's input is crucial in creating comprehensive community development projects. Increase affordable housing opportunities for single adults returning to the district - a Returning Citizens approach to supportive housing.   Create greater incentives for developers to include senior housing in larger development sites, where there are multiple phases and/or buildings. It was reported from the Van Siclen women's shelter - operated by Samartin Daytop Village, they have an increase in senior residents. This is the result of a lack of affordable housing for seniors and housing stock for older adults has not increased at the same rate as other affordable housing formulas. Supportive housing has become the common addition to larger development sites which brings in new residents from other areas - however, our seniors are being pushed out and into temporary housing facilities.  Create incentives for developers of mixed-use development to include local small businesses for tenant opportunities. Currently, the mixed-use development in CB5 has vacant ground floor commercial space due to high rents.  Work with developer to provide greater incentives for Fresh Food markets to be included in mixed use development as healthy, community-friendly anchor tenants. While Dollar Tree and other similar corporations provide a service that the community members are familiar with - they do not add to the overall benefit of the community which includes healthy living primarily, and employment diversity.  Provide a report on the amount of maintenance staff that are assigned to each NYCHA development in CB5. Increase amount of maintenance staff to address frequency of interior cleaning schedules and grounds-keeping maintenance schedules. Commit funding for LED lighting within all CB5 NYCHA developments.  ","Economic empowerment in a community requires participation from small business owners, community based organizations, elected officials, and city agencies. The efforts in revitalizing the commercial corridors in East New York through the Department of Small Business Services, is a great start but it must be continued. Additionally, community based organizations need greater resources when they are tasked with engaging business owners; to increase the outcomes. Currently East New York is home to three Local Development Corporations, Cypress Hills; ENY Restoration; and LDC of East New York, along with Highland Park Community Development Corp. They each have participated in the commercial revitalization efforts through SBS. The results were printed in SBS's Avenue NYC report. Additionally resources have to be increased for those organizations that offer specific services that encourage entrepreneurship and small business development. ENY Restoration LDC provides the only small business incubator spaces for small businesses and LDC of East New York provides services for women in business as the only recognized Small Business Development Center in the community. These are services that strengthen the economic standing of the community and they need to be in receipt of increased focused funding to continue in those efforts. Issue: Office Anchor Strategy plan for East New York must be re-visited. The proposed solution to revitalizing the community to increase office/commercial space for job creation is overlooking the most obvious concern - education. The current proposal identifies a specific area at the Broadway Junction location to be developed for commercial use. The East New York Community has a varied number of commercial strips and one of the largest strip malls in the city with Gateway Center; however, the available employment does not provide the kind of wages that match the cost of living in our borough. Additionally, the EDC has proposed to have HRA as the Anchor tenant in the space at Broadway Junction - and this is redundant as HRA has an existing multiservice center in CB5, at 404 Pine Street; which provides SNAP, Medicaid, and more.  Request: Create the plan that includes a CUNY institution in the potential development site at Broadway Junction.  The city must commit to expanding CUNY to support greater accessibility to higher education.   Broadway Junction is an essential transportation hub and the site is well positioned to host a large campus that can bring to life educational courses, degrees, and adult learning in cooperative economics, various trades and new industries, landscaping, urban planning, engineering, and more. The community has outlined that the need for district-based higher education institutions, is an absolute necessity to prepare our young people for long-lasting career opportunities - not minimum wage positions. Economic growth in a community is not centered on the growth of business but the growth of economic empowerment of the residents who will own and patronize existing and future businesses. ","","","","","Freight movement (loading zones, freight related traffic, etc.)","","Although there are many road related issues that impact Brooklyn, Community Board 5, the issue of freight related traffic in residential areas has been the one that is hardest to address.  Commercial vehicles are storming through small residential blocks in the district with no direction, route guidance and no enforcement.  The result is severely damaged vehicles, destroyed medians and tree implants, and local residents frustrated with 18 wheelers on narrow streets that get stuck because the space does not provide for a safe turn.  The freight management in the Spring Creek/Gateway section of the district is filled with new construction of schools, parks, housing and the Gateway Center Mall - which is the destination of the commercial vehicles.  However, because of the new construction some of the streets are not mapped on freight routes, so they often improvise and get stuck on local residential blocks.","Transportation needs in the district vary depending on the section of the community in question. However, there is a need to conduct surveys to determine the feasibility of speed humps, in particular near schools, day care facilities, and playgrounds. Additionally, safety improvements must include greater community feedback and input. Surveys should be comprehensive and provide residents with an opportunity to give input on paper as well as on-line. Conduct additional surveys at Loring Avenue, Drew, Emerald, and Fountain Avenue - to review the safety measures that were implemented and how they have negatively or positively impacted the flow of traffic for businesses and residents. (a.) New Bike Lanes on Loring Avenue between Eldert Lane and Emerald Street are counterproductive to successful traffic flow. They should be removed on that strip. (b.) Signage on Drew Street between Loring Avenue and Linden Boulevard to address the commercial (large trailers vehicles) trucks parking for extended periods of time. It obstructs vision and creates unsafe walkways, and takes away from potential residential parking (c) Safety measures and bike lanes implemented on Fountain Avenue and Loring Avenues have had a reverse effect on traffic flow.  Traffic congestion has increased due to the implementation of the bike lanes.  Additionally the recent implementation of the ENY Safety Plan under the NYC Department of Transportation which installed three miles of protected bike lanes on Cozine and Wortman Avenues have caused more concern and removed more residential parking than any othe project in the district.  The ENY Safety Improvement plan was implemented after the tragic vehicular deaths of two children in the district - one on Pennsylvania Ave and Dumont and the other near Wortman Avenue.  However, the protected bike lanes on Cozine and Wortman were completed before the necessary speed humps near our district schools.  We need DOT to reassess this area to determine how we can address the new concerns and also to provide a full report on all speed humps installed following the studies conducted during the data collection of the ENY Safety Plan.  https://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/pdf/east-new-york-safety-improvements-jul2022.pdf  ","No comments","","","","","Community facility access and programming","","As the population in Brooklyn, Community Board 5 continues to rise through large affordable housing projects with higher percentages of 2-3br units, it creates an increased need to incorporate resources and programming that can effectively accommodate the populations of families moving in.    The need for a facility that can provide a multitude of services for all ages is an even greater need than in years past.  We are requesting that a full recreation center be constructed in the boundaries of CB5 - The East New York Recreation Center (ENYRC) which would replicate the wonderful programming and services offered in the existing Brownsville Recreation Center (BRC).  There is a potential site that has been identified, which is currently Parks Land at the Sutter Ball Fields.    We are requesting that full study be implemented to report on the feasibility of the proposed project, including estimated funding.","CB5 is extremely proud of the existing investments that we have in our parks and green spaces in the district. We have celebrated the historic ground breaking for Sankofa Playground - one of the most incredible park transformations to come, on the most historic site - the East New York African Burial Ground Square.  It was discovered that remains of african ancestry (enslaved Africans) were identified and retrieved through the dedicated efforts of the Brooklyn Parks Department, under Commissioner Martin Maher in conjunction with Mr. Charles & Inez Barron who represented both the 42nd Council Districts and 60th Assembly Districts in CB5.  This park, formerly Schenck Playground, has received over $4.8 million in capital investment from Mr. & Mrs. Barron with future highlights that will include a full reinternment ceremony and a site to encapture african american history and culture.  The full renovation of Sankofa Playground will be one of CB5's proudest gems and the newest cultural hub, with the projected full renovation of the adjacent New Lots Library.  Collectively, the elected couple have dedicated over $102 million in capital allocations to parks and playgrounds throughout the 42nd Council District, with a great percentage of that investment in the CB5 district.    We would like to the Parks Department to work with CB5 to help promote the ""Friends of the Parks"" initiative through Partnership for Parks to increase more community involvment in the upkeep and maintenance of our highly favored parks sites.  Additionally, we are asking that the Brooklyn Parks Department conduct a study to determine resident usage of parks in the district to provide us with the data to help us understand where comfort stations should be implemented or prioritized for repairs.  We understand that not every park will have a comfort station, but if we are equipped with the information on which sites have the greatest usage, we can advocate accordingly.          2019 has been filled with various ribbon cuttings and ground breaking ceremonies on parks land projects.  We recently learned that joint allocations from NYC Council Member Barron and NYS Assembly Barron totaled over $70 million in our district parks.  This is a true investment in community and healthy livinig.  However, we want to address that some projects still require a comittment from our Brooklyn Parks Department to ensure that the project is comprehensive. For example, the recent allocations to Lion's Pride Park and Success Gardens Playground does not include a comfort station in either park.  The two parks encompass a large existing community and development projects that will bring in hundreds of new families.      ","CB5 is in need of cultural institutions or activation of existing spaces to incorporate programming and educational experiences that expose our children to ongoing opportunities that promote cultural inclusion and community connection.  These services can be activated in our local community centers and libraries.  Additionally, the construction of the ENY Recreation Center would be a perfect opportunity to have a dedicated central location to host ongoing cultural programming and services for all families across the district. ","CB5 is proud of all of our BPL branches in the district.  Spring Creek, New Lots, Cypress, and Arlington  Spring Creek Library is one of the libraries in the district that is situated in one of the most densely populated neighborhoods. It is surrounded by Starrett City, Council Towers, Meadow Wood Gardens, Gateway Elton apartments and nearby NYCHA developments Penn Wortman, Linden Houses, and Boulevard Houses. However, the amount of book rotation and usage of the space is at bare minimum. We need to create incentives to bring more neighboring residents into the Spring Creek branch. An outreach plan must be implemented and a promotion to attract more visitation to this branch.  CB5 has been prioritized as it relates to funding on one of our library sites - New Lots Library.  This BPL branch is slated for complete renovations totaling over $20million with combined allocations from former Mayor deBlasio and former NYC Council Member Inez Barron.  Through Council Member Barron's allocation, there will be dedicated areas created to highlight cultures and literature for people of african descent.  This provides our district with a location to house cultural programming and additonal services that promote cultural inclusion and educational experiences for community families.  We would like to advocate for funding to ensure those programs exist through permanent funding streams.     SEE DETAILS ON NEW LOTS LIBRARY RENOVATIONS & VIDEO BELOW:  https://www.bklynlibrary.org/locations/new-lots/reconstruct#:~:text Construction%20is%20anticipated%20to%20begin,accommodate%20library%20staff%20and%20patrons.  ","Brooklyn, Community Board has been housed in the historic 127 Pennsylvania Avenue site in the 37th Council Distirct.  Following the ENY Rezone, the building received major renovations through a $9.4million capital allocation through the office of former NYC Council Member Espinal.  Funding was activated through the management of the NYC Police Department and houses their Youth Strategies, School Safety, and Community Affairs divisions.  Moreover, Brooklyn Community Board 5 also returned to the building, which was home to the District Office for over 40 years.  https://www.nyc.gov/assets/planning/download/pdf/plans-studies/east-new-york/east_new_york_progress_highlights_12-2021.pdf    The much needed renovations restored the building's beautiful interiors and helped in creating new spaces for youth programming, older adult services, a gym, dance room, and much more.  The 127 Pennsylvania Avenue Police Community Center now services children and families on a daily basis with programming being provided till 10pm.    However, there are still structural issues that must be addressed in the building.  Unfortunately, there are still leaks in the ceilings and some construction matters that are still pending. We are in need of a building assessment and capital investment to address roof issues and other structural matters that are still pending.   ","","","","","Brooklyn, Community Board 5 has a growing population and the creation of over 5,000 units of affordable housing, completed or slated for construction within our district.  Although there have been resources that were implemented along the way to compliment some of the housing projects, there is still the long-time request for a full CUNY facility to be erected in the district.  According to the NYC Department of Health's Neighborhood Profile - only 1 in 5 adults has a college degree in CB5, which is only 21% of the population in comparison to NYC's overall rate of over 44%.  This must be a priority if we want to see growth in community.  Currently we have a satellite site of Kingsborough Community College in CB5, located in the newly constructed Chestnut Commons.  This is a true example of innovative mixed-use, affordable housing.  However, the long time request for a full CUNY facility has yet to be seriously addressed.  The opportunity is now open again as the discussions around the development of the Broadway Junction area are in the works.  We saw the opportunity slip through our hands as talks of an ""anchor tenant"" floated around and manifested with a beautiful new construction site at 2440 Fulton which was assigned to NYC's Human Resources Administration.  What is the message that we are projecting when we invest in new construction for HRA and not CUNY.  We have more young adults seeking HRA services than we do enrolling in higher education.  The 2440 Fulton Street facility perpetuates that narrative and helps to feed the idea that social services and subsidies are of higher value than increased exposure and access to higher education.  Let's not miss the opportunity again.  We are asking that a CUNY facility be prioritized for CB5. ","","","","","","","","","","BK5","","","","","","","","","","",""

From 2010 to 2020, the population has increased by 9% (104,709 according to the 2010 Census figure; 113,933 in 2020 according to the New York City Population FactFinder, and even higher by some estimates). The district is one of the wealthiest, healthiest, and most educated community districts in New York City. Each of our neighborhoods possesses distinctive characteristics; collectively, they reflect our City's vibrant diversity. There are many strengths and assets across the district, including deeply engaged community members, exceptional community-based organizations, excellent (albeit inequitable) schools, physical assets such as the waterfront and parks, landmark districts, and robust economic activity, including essential industrial businesses.  However, the data that the City relies on for budget allocations mask disparities across different sections of the community. This is most apparent based on comparisons of census tracts and neighborhoods:  Additionally, we must continue to emphasize the issues underlying the City's commitments to specific aspects of the Gowanus rezoning, outlined in the Community Board's conditions for approval, as well as demands from many community organizations, elected officials, and Mayor Eric Adams.  There are many specific requirements stated in our Gowanus Zoning Resolution approved on June 23, 2021, that we needn't present here because they were already explicitly conveyed through the DEIS Comments process and the 56-point Points of Agreement, which included requirements for neighborhood investments in housing, infrastructure, public space, community amenities, and workforce and business support programs to improve the quality of life for current and future residents.  The document included conditions related to   	Accountability, Implementation, and Community Participation 	Public Housing 	Affordable Housing & Tenant Support 	Small Business & Workforce 	Industrial Business Zone 	Open Space & Waterfront Access Plan 	Sustainability & Resiliency 	Transportation & Streets 	Community Facilities   We demand that City agencies and elected officials use that as a guide for investment and focus on affected communities.  Although the agreements did not include Red Hook, the community has many of the same challenges, and the points in the agreement can be a guide for investments in Red Hook.    ","","","","","Affordable Housing","","Market forces such as high rental rates, which particularly impact seniors on fixed incomes among others, often lead to displacement from our communities. We need to not only plan to keep our community at home, but we need to ensure that the support networks are in place to allow them to prosper in their home neighborhoods. This also means that regardless of the rezoning of Gowanus, NYCHA properties in both Gowanus and Red Hook are improved and maintained not just in this fiscal year but in perpetuity.","Economic recovery and development","","Businesses need support to be viable, and residents need economic opportunities. Empty storefronts plague our community. We would like to see additional time and energy spent oncoming up with solution that will enable our commercial strips and neighborhood-serving businesses to be viable. This also means that the City must focus on businesses in the IBZ – not only in Gowanus (in the context of rezoning), but also in the Red Hook IBZ and waterfront businesses. The complementary aspect is employment services so that residents --particularly youth and unemployed residents of the NYCHA developments in Red Hook and Gowanus – can have employment pathways. This is particularly critical now because of unemployment and pressures related to COVID. The youth in NYCHA developments need opportunities for training, placement, internships, and summer employment. NYCHA Red Hook residents are also far from the Workforce 1 site in downtown Brooklyn, necessitating more localized services in Red Hook storefronts plague our community.

NYCHA Red Hook residents are also far from the Workforce 1 site in downtown Brooklyn, necessitating more localized services in Red Hook    ","Infrastructure resiliency","","Investing in sustainable infrastructure is critical to make our communities less vulnerable to climate risk and environmental hazards. Flooding, sewage overflow, and power outages are all becoming more frequent due to a lack of coastal hardening, inadequate stormwater management, and surging electricity demand. Two of the neighborhoods that make up our district are susceptible to extreme weather. Red Hook and Gowanus are within flood zones, and we urge the city to determine a means to protect our citizenry, businesses, and industrial community. Park Slope has an especially high-peaking electrical load that burdens the grid in a district where brownouts and blackouts are already rising. To protect our community’s most critical assets, we must expand local power generation with solar and energy storage systems, ensure seniors are protected from power outages and focus on strengthening infrastructure throughout rezoning processes. ","","","","","Services for low-income and vulnerable New Yorkers","","While the District has needs relative to the areas outlined in each of the eleven possible responses, the Department of City Planning's prompt allows for only one selection. As such, we have selected Services for low-income and vulnerable New Yorkers because the most major needs among the other possible answers (Access to healthy food/life style programs; chronic disease prevention; environmental health issues; health facilities; infections disease prevention and management to include COVID-19; mental health programs and substance abuse treatment/prevention programs; programs, services of facilities for seniors; services for domestic violence victims) should, under any reasonable, rational definition of action to address Services for low-income and vulnerable New Yorkers, be addressed as well. ","While we hope the COVID-19 pandemic will be waning by 2022, the fall 2020 wave shows that flexibility is essential in order to reach high-need areas as surges happen and positivity rates change.  CB6 does not have a New York City Health + Hospitals facility and thus lacks access to H+H's rapid point-of-care testing. The only hospital within the district boundaries, Methodist, is not easily accessible to parts of the district, and private urgent care clinics are unevenly distributed.  Mobile and pop-up units can be utilized for vaccinations, including seasonal flu shots; as such investments in such infrastructure has broader use. The loss of Long Island College Hospital has not been sufficiently addressed in the district. ","There is a lack of facilities in the district that would allow some of the agining population to remain in their community as they continue to age and the district becomes more and more expensive to live in. ","While this Board has been in support of the Mayor's short term response to the homeless epidemic in the city, and believes strongly that we have a role to play in helping make sure the district houses its share of the unhoused population, clearly to project of renting hotel rooms for this population is not enough and more permanent facilities are needed. Beyond that, job taining and placement programs to address the root issues for the unhoused population are lacking, and the few local resources available for this are typically non-profit in nature and lacking in critical funding, staffing, and programming. ","New affordable housing, job training and placement programs, as well as much needed improvements to existing NYCHA properties and some mode of polticial infrustrcutre that can demand more accountability from NYCHA broadly. ","","","","","Other - Write In (Required)","","While the Parks within the District have some needs that fall within any reasonable understanding of the fourteen possible responses provided by the Department of City Planning, we have selected ""Other"" because foundational issue that undergirds the needs we have in each of these categories is the City's austerity relative to the needs of the community.","CB6 has historically high income inequality, which can often hide the needs of low-income youth behind unrepresentative averages. As the pandemic closed schools and asked parents to fill the gaps, low-income children in our district have borne the brunt of this exacerbated inequality, with many students experiencing food insecurity and unsafe living situations. We urge SCA to fund ventilation and outdoor infrastructure so public schools can operate more safely during public health crises. In the meantime, we urge DOE to continue to fund school meal programs, with pickup options if schools are closed, and high-speed internet access and computing devices for students who must learn from home and lack these essential resources. With 8% of CB6 residents under the age of 5 (a significantly higher rate than NYC as a whole), day care is an economic issue: parents without access to affordable day care for their children cannot work. We urge DOH to fund affordable day-care options, of which there are only 3 in our district. Finally, the pandemic has caused cuts to youth employment and after-school programs, jeopardizing students' ability to build skills and bounce back after schools reopen. We urge DYCD to re-fund SYEP programs and increase funding to other youth-centered community building initiatives in our district. ","See needs for Youth Education. ","","","","","Traffic violations and enforcement","","The District desperately needs better traffic enforcement and signage, particularly for the heavy volume of truck traffic that exists in the district and will only increase the pending operations of last-mile warehouses in Red Hook and the temporary closing of the BQE.","Traffic enforcement is ciritical throughout the district. Trucks find their ways onto the more residential streets in the district more and more frequently as the years pass, coming off of extremely busy thoroghfares like Atlantic Avenue and 4th Avenue. Signage and enforcement are desperately needed throughout the district to protect pedestrians and bicyclists. This is especially true for Red Hook, where a number of last-mile warehouses are beginning or planning to begin operation. ","The lack of traffic enforcement, signage, and modern traffic design leaves our district's streets overcrowded with large vehicles, making emergency response extremely slow in the most residential of our neighborhoods, which also happens to be the oldest of our neighborhoods. ","","","","","Preparedness for extreme weather events (incl. coastal flooding, heat waves, cold snaps, heavy wind and rain)","","Resiliency and preparing for the impacts of long-term climate change are of the utmost importance not just to the shoreline of the Brooklyn Community Board 6, but to the health and vitality of New York City and the country on the whole.","Many sections of the BKCB-6 map are low-lying and experience frequent flooding during heavy rains and storms. This is especially true in Gowanus and Red Hook, neighborhoods for which the City appears to lack any interest in developing a long-term sustainability plan despite its interest in increasing housing and jobs in these neighborhoods. ","Schools and institutions should be provided with more regular sanitation services such as garbage and recycling pick-up, and DSNY should work with these institutions on placement of containerized storage for waste. With plans to make the Gowanus neighborhood much more residential, DSNY needs to be prepared to offer more and better litter basket collection to the neighborhood. ","","","","","Condition of public housing","","Continuing assessment of maintenance issues in NYCHA housing across the district.","More affordable housing, preservation of existing affordable housing, and zoning and regulation that will improve the existing plague of vacant storefronts along our commercial corridors and allow for a diversity of establishments. ","Housing affordability and a sufficient housing supply is crucial to the health of the City.  New York City's Housing Plan has not kept pace with housing demand, increased jobs and employment numbers. Recent data, even accounting for Covid, still shows that the housing market is strong and has softened only at the very top margins. CB6 recognizes the current dire need for affordable housing within New York City and that this City can and must do much more to expand affordable housing options that allow more residents to share the positive attributes of the district and help to create a more equitable city. CB6 has urged the City to take strong measures to generate more affordable housing through new construction and regulatory changes in CB6 and city-wide. We would like to see the City maximize the number and affordability levels of new housing development, particularly in any new rezoned areas. CB6 residents should have protections from displacement and cost of living burdens, due to increased property values in new development areas, and district wide. The preservation and enhancement of NYCHA properties is imperative, and the City needs to all it can to update and maintain NYCHA properties to serve a critical segment of the City's residents.    ","There are two facets to Community District 6's economic development needs: Invest in Businesses and Invest in People  1) Invest in Businesses:   	Small businesses -- including retail and industrial/manufacturing -- need support to be viable. Empty storefronts plague our community - DCP's pre-COVID report, ""Assessing Storefront Vacancy in NYC,"" characterized Park Slope and Cobble Hill in its ""medium/high vacancy rate"" category, and we have seen newly vacant storefronts increase since COVID.  The district is also heavily reliant on restaurants, which makes the district even more vulnerable to closures and occupancy caps due to the pandemic. According to an analysis reported in The Patch in October 2020, ""The number of empty storefronts on Park Slope's Fifth Avenue more than doubled this year, bringing its vacancy rate to a decade-long high."" (https://patch.com/new-york/parkslope/coronavirus-crisis-doubles-empty-stores-park-slope-main-street). We would like to see additional time and energy spent on coming up with solutions that will enable our commercial strips and neighborhood-serving businesses to be viable. 	This also means that the City must focus on businesses in manufacturing zones.  This has been clearly stated as a priority within the Gowanus rezoning plans, but it also applies to Red Hook's industrial areas, including the IBZ and waterfront businesses.  These businesses typically offer better pay than retail, and have more advancement opportunities.  The City must invest time and resources in the industrial and manufacturing sector/   2) Invest in People   	Residents -- particularly youth and unemployed residents of the NYCHA developments in Red Hook and Gowanus - need employment pathways. Unemployment was already high before the pandemic, and it has gotten worse. Youth have few employment pathways, as the Summer Youth Employment Program was almost eliminated last year, and it has become nearly impossible to obtain internships and entry-level jobs. Youth in NYCHA developments who need opportunities for training, placement, internships, summer employment and career support.  	NYCHA Red Hook residents are also far from the Workforce 1 site in downtown Brooklyn, necessitating more localized workforce services in Red Hook 	We continue to want to see expansion of commercial corrider BIDs and increased technical assistance, as the BID model has proven to be a great success and is important during the pandemic (https://commercialobserver.com/2020/05/in-the-wake-of-covid-19-new-yorks-bids-help-keep-their-neighborhoods-thriving/).  We also would like to see the City be proactive in exploring the formation of an Industrial BID (IBID) or other mechanisms to provide greater support to industrial businesses, including basic services and long-term investments in infrastucture that will support growth in local business districts and access to the districts extensive waterfront. 	Finally, it is essential to ensure that families have adequate affordable childcare so that parents can obtain and sustain employment.   ","","","","","Other - Write In (Required)","","Overall Transportation Infrastructure - Roadway design that will improve pedestrian and cyclist safety are high priorities, including the implementation of curb extensions and high-visibility crosswalks, and enhancement and connection of the bike lane network.

They are expected to do this with a much reduced and declining percentage of the NYC budget.  They are unable to hire and train permanent staff and must rely on temporary workfare recipients for much of their work.  Most of our parks are just barely maintained and shabby compared to the Parks I have seen in Europe.  It just comes down to pride of place and proper funding. ","","Both the Carroll Gardens and Park Slope branches of the Brooklyn Public Library are in need of various capital improvements, and as is the case with all other public buildings in the current state of the COVID-19 pandemic, the ventilation systems in all of the District's library buildings should be reassessed and replaced if need be. ","Community Boards have seen their responsibilites expand rapidly over the last decade, all without any update to their funding or staffing capacity. In just the last few years, District Office staff have been newly tasked with digital timesheet entry and confimation and learning multiple purchase order and inventory programs, both projects that used to be handled by the Borough President's office. Additionally, District Office staff are now responsible for major digital projects, such as this District Needs and Capital/Expense Budget Priorities. All of this while the Boards themselves will start to lean on the District Office staff more than ever with the advent of Board Member term limits. To say that Community Board funding should be maintaned at its current level is an especially gracious understatment. ","","","","","Explanation","","","",""," This submission process does not allow for anything close to a comprehensive assessment of district needs or thorough budget recommendations. Revenue for the budget is left out of the process, as are adjustments to agency roles. For example, asking to increase funding for traffic enforcement should not require indicating support to increase resources for the NYPD.   After this is submitted, Brooklyn Community Board 6 intends to keep commenting and advocating for a better budget as we have in years past. There are seven months before FY 2024 begins, and things can certainly change a great deal between now and then, and this process should adjust accordingly.","","","","","BK6","","","","","","","","","","",""

Home to a diverse and integrated population, the District is comprised of two main communities: Sunset Park and Windsor Terrace. Other community identities have gained popularity and become more established recently, including Greenwood Heights and South Park Slope. Sunset Park consists of a strong residential community, two thriving commercial strips, 5th and 8th Avenues, and a large industrial area, mainly west of 3rd Avenue, along the waterfront. It is bifurcated by the Gowanus Expressway and is bordered to the south by the Long Island Rail Road cut. The 23-acre facility, Sunset Park, has an Olympic-sized swimming pool, a recreation center and a large open space with spectacular views of the harbor. Windsor Terrace and the northern part of the district consist of a smaller residential community with three main commercial strips on 5th and 7th Avenues and Prospect Park West. Windsor Terrace is surrounded by the natural boundaries of Prospect Park and Green-Wood Cemetery. The Gothic Brownstone ""gatehouse"" at the cemetery's entrance is a New York City landmark and the most widely known symbol of the community. The District has been home to generations of immigrants, Irish and Italian and Scandinavian in the early 20th century and before. Mid-century saw a population influx from Puerto Rico, then immigrants from the Dominican Republic and from central and South America. The 1980s saw a large increase in residents from China and the 90s began an influx from Mexico, more rural areas of China and, to a lesser extent, the Middle East. Our community is extremely diverse and yet our populations live peacefully side by side making for a family-friendly neighborhood. Community residents have learned to organize to fight for resources and demand change and our collective action has produced positive results. We defeated a floating power plant in 2004 that would have been taller than any building in the area and longer than the Titanic. We rezoned most of our residential community in 2005 and 2009. After a 40-year effort, we finally built a local high school in 2009 and followed that up with eight additional schools and another, in the landmarked old 68th Precinct building, in progress. We finished our 197-a Plan, which calls for the preservation and enhancement of our industrial waterfront, calling for improved environmental performance and additional recreation opportunities on our waterfront and it was passed by the City. New businesses are bringing investments, industries and jobs to our waterfront.  We are home to a bio-technology center, enormous economic development investments at Industry City, Liberty View Plaza, the Brooklyn Army Terminal, Made in NY Campus, Bush Terminal and the South Brooklyn Marine Terminal and we have the capacity to continue to grow our industrial sector with good-paying jobs for local residents. We have led the local effort to improve pedestrian safety and redesign our streets for safety and mobility improvements. We created the first committee in the City on last mile trucking and been a citywide leader on the issue. We lead on finding innovative ways to reach out to all of our residents. We were the first Community Board to create a committee on access and ability, to break down barriers and find solutions for accessing public spaces and meetings. Clearly, positive changes and investments are being made in our community, but more needs to be done for a community that had been left behind in the past. Our Board has been forward-looking and aggressive in our pursuit of investments and infrastructure improvements that will enhance the lives and livelihoods of our residents, workers and business owners. We are proud to have held thirty-five community meetings over two years to educate our residents and take feedback before we deliberated on Industry City's proposed rezoning of much of the waterfront. We have welcomed the Brooklyn Nets practice facility, NYU Hospital's upgrades, Steiner Studios (currently under development), the waterfront greenway (currently under partial construction), the rehabilitation of 4th Avenue as a more pedestrian-friendly corridor.  Equinor will soon build its new offshore wind turbine construction and onshore power facility on our waterfront, making Sunset Park the hub of New York City's green energy revolution. However, there continue to be sections of our community that have not received sufficient investments and improvements and this continues to leave many of our residents behind. Our community has many inadequate school facilities, an insufficient amount of parkland, the second oldest housing stock in NYC according to NYU, and a serious lack of affordable and senior housing units. We do more than our fair share when it comes to sanitation infrastructure, vehicle storage, power production and serving the homeless. Our waterfront access is extremely limited. There are concerns that the investments being made may not have a positive impact on the local residents and may exacerbate economic pressures and displacement. Many of our streets remain dangerous to cross and have crumbling infrastructure. Public transportation does not extend far enough and is in need of upgrades. We do not have fiber-optic cable in much of the neighborhood and more than 20% of households in Sunset Park do not have internet service, according to a recent survey. The Gowanus Expressway is under constant construction and continues to bring 50 million emission-spewing vehicles through our district every year. ","","","","","Affordable Housing","","With increasing income inequality and a tightening market for affordable housing, long-time residents of Community Board 7 Brooklyn are being displaced and many residents are forced to live in severely overcrowded conditions. Few units of affordable housing are being built and existing affordable housing is being lost through landlords opting-out, speculative development and tenant harassment.  There are a range of new insights into the relationship between affordable housing and life outcomes for children and families.  The lack of stable, affordable housing increases stress on families and can be tied to many of the other issues identified in this report.  The few affordable spaces are put into a city-wide lottery system that makes creation of such units less impactful in reducing such stress locally.  Even the definition of affordability is controversial as the median income of the local community is less than half of what it is for the city in general, making affordability a relative term. While available space in Community District 7 for affordable housing is limited, there is space, owned by the city as well as private ownership, that remains empty and available to build affordable housing, yet this city and state lacks the creativity and leadership to think boldly in solving our housing crisis. ","Schools","","    The high birthrate and the new families who have emigrated to our community create the need for vital support services, which is often placed under the auspices of our schools.  Initiatives to support parents, promote child health and safety, and improve access to high-quality childcare can help the district in five key ways: Positive experiences between birth and school entry boost a child’s healthy development and future prospects. Research clearly demonstrates that the “hard wiring” of a child’s brain occurs during these early years. Children who get off to a good start are less likely to be held back or to get into trouble in school. Studies have even shown that early childhood success can lead to higher college graduation rates, lower crime rates, and reduced need for emergency services many years later. Families are more stable when the needs of their young children are met. When children are healthy and in reliable care, their parents are more likely to maintain steady employment and are typically more productive workers. When children enter school ready to learn, schools are better able to meet high standards and student needs. Successful schools benefit all students, improve a city’s livability, and help develop a strong future workforce. Strong early childhood programs are a valuable asset for local economic development. In the short term, these programs can help attract better workers and support working parents. In the longer term, a city that has made the necessary investments to maintain a quality workforce over time is likely to be more appealing to businesses looking for a stable location. Early childhood initiatives that expand access to quality services help “level the playing field.” Economic, racial, and ethnic disparities are too often perpetuated from one generation to the next unless children from disadvantaged households have the kinds of early childhood opportunities that are commonplace among their more advantaged peers.     Far too many cases have been reported in Sunset Park about children bused to school facilities far away from the district, in one extreme case a set of autistic twin kindergarteners commute over an hour to get to a school with the facilities that can attend to their needs. Nowhere is the challenge for fulfilling the promise of academic achievement greater than in the work with diverse learners (aka students with learning disabilities). All students deserve an education that prepares them for postsecondary success and a lifetime of unlimited opportunity.  Related services include Occupational Therapy (fine motor skill focus), Physical Therapy (gross motor skill focus), Speech Therapy, Language Therapy.  In addition to the services, school buildings should be equipped with relevant facilities like sensory gyms and other technologies such as assistive technologies.   Full Funding of the IDEA is necessary to provide early identification and early intervention services.  Increased and enhanced early childhood programs. Reduced class size and caseloads. Incentives to attract and retain qualified personnel, including teachers, related services personnel, special education administrators, and paraprofessionals. Parent training. Alternative placements for children with behavior disorders and school-wide positive behavioral support programs. After-school, extended-day, and extended-year programs. School- and community-based life skills and vocational training. Technology, both computer-aided instruction and assistive technology devices. School repair, renovation, and construction.     ","Traffic","","The wide boulevards of Community District 7 have long attracted a heavy volume of traffic, often including commuters who shun the constant construction on the Gowanus Expressway to pick their way through local traffic and heavy truck traffic due to the large industrial community.  Often, frustrated drivers try to get around the local traffic by moving through narrower more residential  blocks to get to another avenue, which is frequently just as crowded.  The wide boulevards are home to much of our important community infrastructure, including schools, transportation hubs, businesses and libraries.  Pedestrians need to traverse these wide streets that are often clogged with large, highway traveling trucks.  These ""conflicts"" have too often led to tragic outcomes in our community. The modern economy heavily relies on trucks for delivery and our industrial area is often the starting and ending point for these trucks and they move through the local community, which has poor highway connections and the aforementioned driver-angering traffic. DOT, to its credit, has installed many speed humps and bicycle lanes in the community, but these solutions feel like one-size-fits-all solutions to larger issues.  They do not necessarily address the specific conditions and needs of the local community.  For example, Community Board 7 has been waiting for nearly two decades for DOT to conduct a pedestrian safety study for the intersection of 3rd Avenue and 60th Street, the most dangerous intersection in the community with more than 150 accidents a year and now home to four schools.  DOT sent a non-sequitur response in 2019 to the Board's request to conduct a traffic study for 3rd Avenue and has held workshops with results that have yet to be shared with the public.  CB 7 waited ten years for the completion of the 20th Street truck route study and DOT implemented a “solution” without community input a mere month after sharing a plan that simply put additional traffic on other streets and encouraged off-route trucking.  The agency has yet to review their boondoggle.  After the community pushed back on DOT’s plans to make 7th and 8th Avenues one-way, as they were inadequate to addressing the community’s needs, DOT decided to scrap the plan rather than engage in dialogue.  The agency does not appear to accept community input.  Even the 4th Avenue bike lane, announced at a press conference by the commissioner to be expedited and completed by the end of 2019, still awaits completion.  CB 7 believes DOT should listen to the needs and lived experiences of the local community to determine what should be prioritized for study and improvement, not inform the community what our priorities should be. ","","","","","Services to reduce or prevent homelessness",""," DHS's past failure to communicate with the local residents or even elected officials and government agencies about new and existing shelters makes the local community believe the City is hiding something, such as placing pedophiles in the community.  Even after DHS has corrected these missteps, giving us six months notice in one of the most recent placements, the lack of trust is a terrible disservice to the clients the agency serves.  The lack of information prior to opening coronavirus-related shelters locally led to rumors and distrust in multiple city agencies.  Ours is a welcoming community and embraces people of all backgrounds and economic status, recently holding a clothing and resource drive for migrants from Central America housed in a hotel in the community, but the City's past failure to disclose builds distrust for the City and the vulnerable population they are trying to serve.  Efforts must be made to improve DHS's negative image.  That starts with communication.  As new hotel-based shelters open with little or no community notice, we find the city's pledge to be out of the hotels by 2023 to be another likely empty promise.  Back in 2008 we foresaw the potential of speculative as-of-right hotel development in our manufacturing areas fearing housing intrusion of manufacturing areas, driving up industrial property values, potentially making industrial businesses unviable.  We worried that these hotels could also become homeless shelters.  Our City Councilman at the time pledged to submit legislation to prevent as-of-right hotels.  That Councilman's name was Bill deBlasio.  This is why we do not trust the city's policies and promises on this issue. Further, while Community District 7 has welcomed these shelters, it is the responsibility of every district to bear their fare share. Districts to our north and south have just a fraction of shelters that District 7 does; some do not even have a shelter in their district at all.  The recent influx of migrants, also disproportionately housed in CD7 compared to neighboring districts, has exacerbated these problems, shining a light on the lack of resources for dealing with local impacts, as well as the City's poor communication, even with other city agencies.","No comments","Under the FY25 Capital Priorities for the Board, our members call for an increase in programmatic funding for existing senior centers in the district. Our members are concerned about the proliferation of for-profit adult day services around the city and believe the city's senior centers provide a much higher level or service and more opportunities for seniors. Unfortunately, the city centers are not eligible for the Medicaid funding and therefore are not playing on an even field. CB 7 believes the city should provide additional funds to allow for the centers to increase the number of seniors the serve. ","Unfortunately, the current Administration's policy with regard to communication on the opening of shelters, both homeless and migrant, has remained the same as the previous Administration.  DHS fails to notify CB 7 of the open of shelters until the last moment and has even denied shelters were opening at specific locations when questioned by the Board only to backtrack within hours of their denials.  This does not engender good will with the local community.  Despite the Administration's best efforts to stigmatize the very people they claim they are helping, CB 7 and its members have organized and participated to clothing and hygiene product drives to help these populations acclimate to NYC and to the local community, going so far as to develop multi-language ""Welcome"" materials to let our new neighbors know about parks and shopping and other amenities to their new, most often, temporary home.  Our community is largely sympathetic to poor people and immigrants, but the City's failure to communicate makes it appear that something is being hidden from the local community. ","CD 7 has a high rate of poverty (28%), a very large foreign-born population (47.2%) and well below average for English proficiency and educational attainment so it could be argued than all services provided are for low-income and vulnerable New Yorkers in our neighborhoods. ","","","","","Support services for special needs youth (disabled, immigrant, non-English proficient, etc.)","","The coronavirus emergency closed our schools twice and reduced us to a hybrid model during the beginning of the last school year in 2021.  Admittedly, DOE has had to scramble to provide resources for students and families due to the unprecedented emergency, but the needs of our largely immigrant and poor community, with its infrastructure deficiencies, were already greater than most of the city and now the chasm is even wider.  The health emergency brought these issues to the forefront.  Poor wi-fi service in many areas of the community lead students to rely on mobile connections, which are of poor quality and reliability.  Much of our community still relies on outdated copper wire and lacks fiber optic cable.  A lack of technology services for teachers, administrators and especially families and students who may not be technologically and English-proficient, has left our students further behind, likely increasing a disparity of income, often due to a lack of appropriate infrastructure investment over decades.  At the very least the city should commit to ensuring that all households have the ability to access wifi.  Students should not be forced to go to fast food restaurants or sit outside closed libraries and schools to gain their education.  To reduce these disparities and help correct the inequities of the past, New York City should commit to providing free wifi services for our entire community. Community Board 7 recently signed on to a petition calling for comprehensive services and programming, including afterschool programming, for all students in our community.  Space requirements often preclude important programming for development and advancement and support services for those with needs.  However, as additional school seats are slated to open up, reducing the overcrowding burden on our local schools, we must reimagine our facilities and programs, especially their accessibility to all. ","CB 7 has worked recently collecting sites for future school construction. Recent school construction belies the fact that our schools are overcrowded for lack of appropriate planning in the past as our community's population has grown 50% in 20 years. However, the recent opening of schools, with more on the way, as well as a student population drop after schools reopened from covid closures, has eased some of the burden on our facilities allowing us to rethink our needs and to call for accessible, equitable and culturally sensitive programming and services at all of our schools, with afterschool programs to enhance scholarship and ease burdens on families and support services for those who need additional assistance.  Additional space can allow us to reduce class sizes and bring back art programs, science labs, gyms, lunch rooms and libraries that have been repurposed in the past for classroom space.     We recognize the importance of early childhood education and this deficit of seats has left a generations of our children, who are mostly poor and/or from immigrant families, at a terrible disadvantage.   With the  diverse populations within our community, there is an immediate need for augmented bilingual/ESL education for our Latino, Asian, Middles Eastern and Eastern European populations. Additionally, English proficiency programs, perhaps through our schools using the very students who are mastering language skills, for older residents would serve a great need for our community. Work skills and experience programs, such as SYEP and internships, must be expanded to prepare our students for the job market. We are very pleased that our high school's curriculum embraces such learning outside the classroom and that two AmeriCorps programs serve our community through the Red Hook Community Justice Center and NYU Family Health Care. ","The population of the District has a large percentage of young people (30% under age 19) and programs for youth are greatly needed.  Since our District has a minimum of public recreation space our children must rely on afterschool and other community-based programs for arts, entertainment, sports and academic help.  Many of our residents fall beneath the poverty line and parents often have to work more than one job to support their families.  These programs are vitally important to the life, learning and social skills of our youngest residents.  The City must do more to support our children and our community-based organizations by providing additional funds.    We must consider the need for afterschool and vacation care for children whose parents work.  Additional funds must be available to support organizations that provide these services to create more day care slots for the local community and facilities.  This could have an added benefit of creating jobs.    Our local SYEP program is run through a program located at our high school and the school has an aggressive internship program for upperclassmen, but these options are not enough for a community with such a large youth population.  The approximately 1600 SYEP slots are the same amount we had a decade ago, when our population was smaller.  When the economy turned bad, there was increased competition from older workers for precious few jobs, increasing youth unemployment.  These programs provide some of the few opportunities our young people have to gain work experience.      CB7 held two gang awareness forums for youth and parents to make people aware of the local gangs in the community and alternatives.  NYPD and former gang members provided dozens of people with stark information.  Awareness, avoidance and alternatives are keys to combating this problem in our community.","","","","","Police-community relations","","CB 7 is a relatively low crime community, although we have seen major crimes jump about 50% in the past two years.  High profile events in the past, including some that have taken place outside of our community and even city, have reopened a rift between some parts of the community and the 72nd Precinct.  We acknowledge that the precinct and Brooklyn South have worked diligently to overcome this divergence.  We believe community relations have been enhanced with the implementation of the Neighborhood Coordination Officers.  We are strong believers that positive relations between our precinct and our residents will lead to even better results in reducing crimes and particularly quality-of-life complaints.   However, better communication between individual officers and some members of the community does not make up for failures to respond appropriately to some quality of life concerns as well as failure to enforce safety regulations, such as speeding and off-route trucks.  Community relations can only further improve with better service from the local precinct, addressing the sometimes years-long quality of life issues.  Better communications can help residents understand how particular quality-of-life concerns are addressed rather than discourage individuals from making complaints in the future if they do not think their concerns are being addressed.  However, the recent change of command at the Precinct has greatly improved communications in the District and has also witnessed a corresponding decrease in crime.  We believe this communication has improved relations with the local community and goes hand in hand with the decrease in crime. ","The implementation of the Neighborhood Coordination Officer program (NCO) has helped to foster improved community relations and dialogue. Residents now have direct access to their local officers, who are essentially community specialists. The diverse NCO officers reflect the diversity of our community, improving understanding, trust and communication, However quality-of-life concerns are the most frequent constituent complaints addressed through the Community Board. The top QOL complaints we recent include: * Double-parking. Changes to and construction on 4th Avenue have highlighted the need for vigorous double-parking enforcement; * Noise. Noise complaints, which are most prevalent in the summer, include residential, but usually concern noise and illegal behavior at businesses (particularly one's with liquor licenses); * Prostitution. We have seen recent spike in our prostitution complaints, particularly on 39th Street, at or near newly built hotels in the manufacturing district; * Vagrancy/public intoxication: We have also seen an uptick in complaints about vagrancy/public intoxication, particularly in or near parks. The recent introduction of a homeless population to the district through hotels in the manufacturing zones may have led to this increase; * Nightlife. Our community has become popular for weekend raves and party boats have come to the 58th Street Pier (without community approval). This has stretch NYPD resources thin during weekends. Pedestrian safety is also a top concern and we are trying to address this issue through DOT, however, it is vital that appropriate NYPD resources be made available, including an increase in the number of school crossing guards allocated to our community. We have new schools, annexes, pre-K facilities and charters in the past 20 years, as well as a burgeoning population, but have not seen an increase to crossing guards in decades. Several children have been injured or even killed in our district in the past years making this an essential need.  We have also heard increased concerns and a need for education and enforcement on motorized bikes on sidewalks, in parks and in bike lanes. ","No comments","","","","","Cleanliness/trash collection","","All of the above choices are of great concern, however street cleanliness has always been a big issue for our community.  Recent efforts made by the DSNY, including enhanced cleaning and additional basket pick up along with resources provided by the Councilmember and Borough President have helped improve our ratings to where we are above average for Brooklyn, but still below City average.  Cleanliness concerns remain on the cleanliness of our commercial strips, near transit hubs, our industrial area, beneath the Gowanus Expressway and alongside Green-Wood Cemetery and the MTA properties.  ","The sewers, watermains and catch basins in this community are among the oldest in Brooklyn. There are a number of sewer collapses and undermined roadways reported to the Board each year. Several street reconstruction projects have been on our roster of Capital Budget requests for more than twenty years. The heavy volume of traffic, particularly on 3rd, 4th, 5th, 8th and Caton Avenues, major thoroughfares and truck routes, causes severe wear and erosion on these streets and off-route trucks put an additional heavy burden on our side streets, which were not meant to accommodate such heavy vehicles. Our old streets and infrastructure are crumbling and additional contracts and resources must be made available for trenching activities. While the City occasionally paves streets, we are fearful that the underlying causes of the street degradation are not being addressed and repaving merely covers over the problems. We believe that DOT and DEP must address these concerns much sooner and more comprehensively, otherwise it may simply be a waste of funds as streets keep sinking despite new asphalt. Five years ago, a pipe thirty feet below 43rd Street broke leaving residents and businesses on the block without water, sewer and other city services, months of construction and a lack of access, as well as other hardships, on the block. Four years ago, a street collapse on 64th Street prevented travel on the heavily-used Fifth Avenue, including the rerouting of the bus for several days, causing hardships and loss of revenue for residents and businesses alike. It took over a year to repair. We believe that if the sewer and water pipes were replaced in 1988, as they were scheduled to be, this expensive, year-long plus infrastructure problem would not have occurred. We still are waiting on this work, nearly forty years later while the project languishes in the ""10 year plan.""  Kermit Place's new sewers are also on the alleged 10 year plan.  The 2005 replacement of the sewer pipe on 1st Avenue never occurred and seems to have completely disappeared.  Unfortunately, recent heavy rainstorms, which are only getting more frequent have flooded numerous sections of our district, particularly just south of Prospect Park. ","Community District 7 continues to host more than its fair share of sanitation facilities. In addition to numerous private carters and recyclers, we are also home to the SIMS Municipal Recycling Facility, which will take most of NYC's metal and plastic recyclables; the garage for BK-7 and BK-10 (which serves CB10); the Hamilton Avenue Marine Transfer Station. A private company that takes 1000 tons of city residential trash every day on 50th Street.  All these facilities require additional trucks in our community and, unfortunately, sometimes we are taken advantage of. Many of the private municipal waste truck drivers take liberties by parking beneath the Gowanus Expressway, along 3rd Avenue or next to Green-Wood Cemetery.  For many years CB7 has advocated for moving our sanitation garage to a location off the harbor, as it doesn't need to be water adjacent.  We have been denied for two decades.  However, 2040 zero emissions standards for the fleet will require a larger facility (for equipment, charging, etc.) than the current garage and so we are asking, given our overburden of DSNY facilities, that ours becomes the first DSNY garage to comply with zero emissions and requiring us to find space and build a modern facility, preferable not directly on the waterfront. ","","","","","Affordable housing creation","","There is a rising concern that new housing development is not affordable for local residents, as the median income in CB 7 is approximately $43,000/year, while the standard for affordability includes the median income from more affluent communities.  Additionally, affordable units that are mandatory within a project that includes developer incentives need to include family-sized units and not just studio and one-bedroom units.  Many in the community find the city's current MIH program insufficient for creating the number of affordable units our community needs and the levels of affordability still out of reach for most of our community.  We often are asked whom these units are meant for as it is noted that Area Median Income is calculated using more affluent communities and counties, meaning units that are affordable in general to NYC residents remain outside of the price range of most of our local residents.  Many look to the Fifth Avenue Committee's projects at the Sunset Park Library and at 4th Avenue and 63rd Streets as a model for not-for-profit based housing development that is affordable to local residents.","CB7 is greatly concerned that hotels are allowed as-of-right in manufacturing districts, as we believe this is a back door way to promote housing expansion.  We have spent almost two decades promoting and trying to safeguard our industrial waterfront, through our 197-a study and plan, and wish DCP would close this loophole, which could have devastating consequences for businesses and local employment if additional hotels are allowed to open in our manufacturing area.  Many of the most recent hotels built in our community are either being used for homeless shelters.  We are concerned these uses may one day make our manufacturing zones unaffordable, opening the door for housing, and throwing thousands of local residents out of their jobs.  This as-of-right loophole for hotels in manufacturing zones must be closed.    When he was Councilman for this community, Mr. deBlasio promised legislation to close the loophole to allow hotels in manufacturing zones as of right.  A decade later we are still waiting for that legislation.  In the meantime, those hotels have now become the City's homeless plan.","No comments","Our Board welcomes economic development along our waterfront, but insists that any development immediately adjacent to the water be limited to water-dependant and community uses. Our waterfront is our greatest physical asset with spectacular views and large areas ripe for development. We strongly believe that any development in our community must be sensitive to our current residents and businesses. Should businesses be required to move as part of a major development, priority should be given to relocating the businesses within the community. Our priority is to bring additional jobs to the community, not to force some businesses to leave. Our community has seen much of its potential wasted in the past from the placement of negative-impact facilities, such as the Metropolitan Detention Center, power plants and waste transfer stations. The community has received a disproportionate number of these facilities while many of the other neighborhoods in the City receive money to lessen the impact of such facilities or relocated them altogether. Our community has received millions, and promised additional billions, in public and private investments in recent years and there is a concern that such developments and changes will not reach the local residents and may even have negative consequences, such as making housing unaffordable.  ","","","","","Roadway and traffic design","","DOT should immediately commit to study and make changes to the intersection of 3rd Avenue and 60th Street, and to conduct a truck route efficiency and safety study for the community in the interest of public safety for the safety of all users and to move goods as efficiently as possible with as little conflict with pedestrians and bicyclists as possible.  We do not understand why these are not a priority of DOT.  The intersection at 3rd Avenue and 60th Street is the most dangerous in the community with over 190 crashes in the past 10 years, resulting in over 300 injuries, as well as a myriad of other safety issues including limited lighting, potholes in crosswalks, and undersized medians which provide almost no protection to vulnerable road users and pedestrians, giving them limited time to cross nine lanes of traffic.  In 2021 we opened two new schools at the intersection, which along with PS 503 and PS 506 across the street, have added hundreds of small stature pedestrians to this intersection every school day.  CB7 has been waiting for what was called a ""Safe Routes to School"" study for this intersection since at least 2003.  Third Avenue itself is the most dangerous roadway in Brooklyn, and its lack of safety is compounded by issues like areas of insufficient lighting and a large quantity of sidewalks and curb cuts which do not meet DOT’s Federally-mandated accessibility standards. DOT's intransigence is baffling for an agency that supposedly has a vision for zero pedestrian deaths.  Goals need to be followed by actions, which have not been forthcoming. A truck route study is also a necessity for our community.  We previously discussed the danger these trucks present to other users of the streets, but the need for a truck route study has increased as more trucks have become necessary to deliver goods both locally and to other communities. This has been compounded by the increase in warehouses and depots within our community, which are often the starting point for these trucks. These delivery services and depots are expanding at an unsustainable pace in our community and nearby.  Our community also faces a large increase in truck trips due to the  new last mile facilities opening. This will exacerbate an already dangerous situation as DOT has reduced our trucks routes, furthering the danger along existing routes or encouraging off-route trucking as traffic volume along designated routes increases. Instead of these studies, DOT has pushed through half thought out plans for 20th Street, Park Circle and 7th and 8th Avenues with little community input or notification.  It appears DOT rushed to fulfill the previous administration's political promises rather than carefully study problems and create solutions tailored to local needs.  But the DOT does not communicate.  In fact, it took an Article 78 lawsuit from Assemblyman Abbate to even get DOT to agree to follow the law.   ","Transportation issues are amongst our most pressing.  This is because we are home to two major highways, a large industrial area that requires trucks and because transportation issues have a strong impact on public safety and the quality-of-life in our community.      State DOT also plays a crucial role in how trucks access our community as most come via the Gowanus and Prospect Expressways.  Unfortunately, constant repair of the Gowanus and terrible traffic on both highways encourages drivers to get off the highways and travel local streets.  In addition, a lack of appropriate highway entrances and exits, coupled with our large industrial area, mean that we constantly have problems with off-route trucks looking for ways to get around traffic.  These additional trucks on our streets, with more coming due to welcomed economic development along our waterfront, mean additional conflicts with and dangers for pedestrians.      City DOT, however, has recognized these conflicts and has worked with the Community Board and others to develop a traffic and pedestrian safety plan for 4th Avenue that has reduced the number of traffic lanes from three to two (north and south), widened the pedestrian medians and vehicle turning lanes, added high visibility paint and plastic bollards.  Additional improvements are expected, including sheltered bike lanes and planted medians.  However, because the City failed to keep up with these infrastructure needs for decades, many of the projects are happening at the same time, as the City rushes to support our economic growth in the industrial area, including simultaneous lane closures on 2nd, 3rd and 4th Avenues, daily work on the Gowanus Expressway structure, and side street closures in the 40s and 50s. This leads us to worry that agencies are not properly communicating and coordinating on projects, producing extra burdens on our residents and businesses.","While we are happy that MTA has added an elevator to the 59th Street station, it is not nearly enough. All station rehabilitations should include elevator and/or ramps. We are very happy the 53rd Street and Prospect Avenue stations have recently been rehabilitated, we feel accessibility is much more important than cell phone charging. We are hopeful that a new elevator for the 36th Street station, which is in the MTA's 5 year capital plan will not be delayed for budgetary reasons.  More frequent bus service is necessary on Third, Eighth and particularly on Fifth Avenue, especially when school is in session. MTA failed to provide traffic agents along 4th Avenue, as promised creating a safety hazard for all traverse the boulevard. ","","","","","Community facility access and programming","","Community Board 7 calls on the administration, through the Department of Youth and Community Development, to reimagine and design a community center modeled on the Cornerstone at 4201 4th Avenue, the building in which the Community Board resides.  Our district has well below the city’s minimum standard of parkland acreage per capita with few spaces available for the creation of additional park space.  Although the Department of City Planning says nearly 25% of our community is parks or greenspace, 95% of that is Green-Wood Cemetery, which does not present an opportunity for recreation beyond walking.  4201 4th Avenue, the old Courthouse, is currently the temporary home for the Sunset Park Branch of the Brooklyn Public Library.  Once they return to their rebuilt modern facility, we believe the space in the building that currently houses the library, and perhaps beyond those confines, should remain within community use, rather than returning as a back office or storage for a city agency.  A plan to reimagine the space as a community center would be an ideal fit in our underserved district and should be discussed and workshopped with the public as soon as possible so we can immediately start on the redevelopment after the library’s space is vacated.","Our parks are oases within the concrete City where people of all generations, socio-economic statuses and ethnic and national backgrounds can gather, relax, play or simply enjoy a more pastoral setting within the City.  They are for mental rejuvenation, physical fitness and stress relief.  However, during difficult economic times our parks see an increase in use because of limited personal recreation funds, but often experience a decrease in programming and upkeep.  Together these facts spell trouble for our parks as overused equipment falls into disrepair or natural settings are overtaxed.  Unfortunately for local parks, the City’s main parks seem to get all the attention while our facilities become eyesores.  Facility upgrades are left to our Councilmembers’ discretion and ability to negotiate and while our elected officials have done a great job bring these funds to the community, we believe it is unfair to them to have to concentrate funds in parks that should be funded directly by the agency.  As such, we call upon the City to establish a capital program for local parks that does not rely on limited discretionary funds from elected officials.","No comments","No comments","Community Boards haven't received a non-salary related budget increase in a decade.  Including salaries, budgets have only increased 40% in the past 40 years.  We are in deperate needs of a budget increase as we have been asked to do more and more with no assistance.  For example, we have had to squeeze money out of our budget over several years to be able to enhance our meeting technology, which proved crucial when we had to hold virtual meetings for three years.  Unfortunately, the technology also comes with a maintenance cost for which we also have to find money in our budget.  We have the fewest staff members now than at any time in our history, yet we have new unfunded responsibilities such as hybrid meeting facilitation, social media and website design and posting, contracting, language access and, perhaps, dozens of additional meetings per year to handle cannabis license apllications.  Language access is a particularly important need as 50% of our population is foreign-born, with at least three major languages spoken in the district and our tiny office has no budget and extremely limited internal ability to provide such service.

"132","Dec 4, 2023 11:10:50 am","Dec 4, 2023 1:22:05 pm","Complete","","","","English","","1701706250_656dfa0aeb4428.06733683","","","","","","","","","","BK8","","","","","","","","","","","","","Community Board No. 8 encompasses the neighborhoods of North Crown Heights, Prospect Heights, and Weeksville, and is bounded by Atlantic Avenue on the north, Ralph Avenue on the east, Eastern Parkway on the south and Flatbush Avenue on the west. Our growing Districts' resident demographics and socio-economic statuses are evolving for many reasons, and some of the changing statuses have caused tensions between residents that do not share the same intersections. The aftermath of the Covid-19 Pandemic continues to illustrate multiple disparities and intersections of New York City residents across several high priority areas in District 8, including in housing (security, access and affordability), healthcare, food resources, open space options, and transportation.   Hyper development in some of the remaining undeveloped parcels of land in our District-mainly those parcels in the M-1 or manufacturing zone of Atlantic Avenue to Bergen Street between Grand and Franklin Avenues that formulate the once-called MCROWN zone, now re-named the ""Atlantic Avenue Mixed-Use Corridor"" or AAMUP-as well as increasing the bulk and scale of existing structures, has served to exacerbate gentrification and displacement, resulted in residual rental increases in an expanded area, and fueled tensions between long time and newer, more affluent residents. A new, more insidious consequence has emerged, which is directly related to the disconnect between local elected officials and residents that believe the electeds do not share their concerns for housing access. There is a growing preponderance of residents that believe our electeds' reliance on building new luxury housing as the only methodology for ending the housing affordability crisis, is a disservice to the working class individuals and families that built this city. They have called upon our elected body to cease ignoring the resultant displacement, higher rents, and landlord harassment of long-terms residents resulting from luxury units that sit vacant while the homeless population increases due to an inability to afford rental prices.   Two of the District's population groups-the elderly and youth-have been identified as being alarmingly underserved and under-resourced. There is increasing demand for senior programming and transportation options as well as youth-based programming across several milieu. The ""norm"" should not be the only milieu catered to, and programs and services should be considered that will reach a broader array of personality, emotional, and physical needs. Ensuring that the most vulnerable within already marginalized categories are properly cared for and served helps to prevent unnecessary strain from arising.   Mental health issues continue to be burdensome for a growing number of the district's residents. These issues and concerns remain heightened during the post-Covid-19 recovery era and show no sign of reducing or trending downward. Especially amongst the majority of immigrant and BIPOC (black, indigenous, persons of color) residents, the lack of education around mental illness is pervasive and deters treatment or even serious discussion with family, friends, and healthcare professionals. Educational programs, when combined with mindfulness activities like meditation, gardening, and other holistic health healing approaches, would be beneficial when combined with access to preventative services and care provided by community capital such as green open space, financial security in terms of quality employment and quality housing, public safety, and a general sense of belonging.   We are hopeful that the ensuing narratives and budget requests will help officials determine the best ways to bridge service gaps and offer assistance to the residents of Brooklyn Community Board 8 during FY 2025 and beyond. ","","","","","Affordable Housing","","Since the eviction moratorium came to a close in January 2022, there have been approximately 206 marshal executed evictions in District 8 alone. While for many that number might not seem very high, it is indicative of the lack of affordability in housing for a large number of our District’s residents. Compounding matters are the inefficacies within the City’s housing assistance programs, agency staffing shortages, resistance from landlords to accept vouchers, and greed to name a few. Data indicating that the majority of the city’s residents are rent-burdened is readily available and consistently ignored by pundits that would rather cite a non-existent overall housing shortage instead of the actual issue at hand: affordability. Also ignored in the affordable housing argument are the number of warehoused units that unnecessarily further burden the City’s renter population that consists of two-thirds of the residents of this great city. The standard argument and go-to of pundits to “develop and build” to address the issue merely serves, data has proven, to reduce affordability, increase cost burdens, and contribute further to displacement.    Further complicating matters in the affordable housing conversation are rent-controlled and rent-stabilized units in need of repair whose occupants are being harassed into leaving. Unscrupulous landlords seeking to maximize profits on these units utilize measures designed to skirt provisions from the Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019 that reduce the financial benefit of long term tenants vacating a unit. Such measures used to skirt the tenant protection provisions include dividing or merging apartment units and altering them so much that they no longer fall under the protected status and can be rented for higher market rates, moving in undesirable tenants that serve as harassing agents on behalf of landlords, neglecting repairs to allow the property to decay and become uninhabitable, and several other actions that on the surface are not technically illegal but are certainly unethical, including ignoring vermin complaints and disallowing tenant protections from other tenants’ behaviors. Overall, the new methodologies employed disparately affect the most economically vulnerable tenants.    Moreover, the conversion of small, private homes to multiple dwellings containing luxury condominiums with sales prices that far exceed the economic feasibility for all but the top percentile of residents, coupled with the growing market of illegal short-term rentals, such as private hotels, bed and breakfasts, and hostels, contributes to the spiraling affordable housing crisis in District 8 and New York City as a whole. Current land use trends promoting luxury development featuring up-zoning and focused only on providing the minimum baseline Mandatory Inclusionary Housing (MIH) options (primarily Option 2 and Option 4 at 80% AMI and 115% AMI), have proven vastly insufficient at making a dent in the City’s affordable housing crisis. Unfortunately, these trends are still being viewed as the savior of affordable housing in the city as rents continue to drive upward with large scale developments and despite alarming rates of resident displacement ringing alarm bells to inform officials of the failure of up-zoning to solve the affordability crisis.    As a case-in-point, the current Council District 35 initiated and mayoral supported Atlantic Avenue Mixed Use Plan (AAMUP) framework falls short of the goals presented in the Board’s M-CROWN proposal that we had advocated for in previous years. The AAMUP proposal presented by the Dept. of City Planning should be amended and tweaked as DCP’s draft AAMUP zoning framework fails to address a core goal of M-CROWN, namely, the cross-subsidy of light manufacturing space in order to encourage creation of accessible local jobs with career paths. DCP apparently still wants to fight about that, even though they created a zoning tool for Gowanus that would do much of what CB8 wants. Residential density in the draft AAMUP framework is also greater than that described in CB8’s M-CROWN resolutions, and DCP proposes mapping MIH Option 2, which does not provide for any deeply affordable apartments. As such, we recognize that the draft AAMUP zoning framework fails to address CB8’s affordable housing needs, and doesn’t address the jobs goals of M-CROWN.    Finally, existing large-scale development projects such as Pacific Park/Atlantic Yards Development, pose an ongoing nuisance condition in our community. Unfortunately, as these large-scale projects are usually overseen by the state, city agencies are often unable to assist with resident complaints and amelioration of issues. We urge the Mayor’s office to allow for additional oversight into these projects, specifically Pacific Park/Atlantic Yards, as there is little community benefit while ongoing issues increase damaging effects on the quality of life for residents in the immediate surrounding area. ","Crime and Public Safety","","Despite official crime statistics presented by NYPD and other city officials trending downward, residents of District 8 report feeling a level of unsafety not seen since the 1980s and early 1990s. While this is partly due to the number of brazen violent incidents occurring in broad daylight, much of the lack of safety stems from the abundance of individuals with substance abuse issues and untreated mental health conditions in unhoused states on our streets as well as an abundance of unhoused and/or under-housed individuals, depleted socio-economic statuses, poor quality open spaces, and a dearth of social programs to name a few. Solutions to the fear and the violence are not reducible to solutions of simply adding more police officers and cameras on street furniture and infrastructure.  However, something must be done to ameliorate crime and criminal activity, and this can be completed more holistically than a simple reliance on “law and order.” Criminalization of the unhoused, of addicts, and of the mentally ill is not the answer, and there must be investment in areas that allow for distinguishment of nefarious criminal acts from those that can benefit from treatment of substances abuse and mental health episodes and crises.   A safe community is one in which all residents have access to a quality education, safe and healthy homes, adequate employment, transportation, physical activity,  and nutrition, in addition to quality medical care. The health and safety of a community is co-dependent on these and several other factors, and unfortunately in New York City, the factors that lie outside of the purview of the NYPD are considerably underfunded or quite frankly not funded at all. Holistic concepts of public safety recognize the influence of social, economic, psychological and environmental well-being of the community on people’s perception of safety and their psyches. Community investments in the form of open space, education, programming, arts and cultural input, and so much more go much further than the placement of bodies with weapons to police the activities of a population. Sadly, the dearth of social programming across all age groups further deteriorates the sense of safety as does insecure housing options and subpar educational standards in District 8.    Fully funded and adequate social service, diversion, and alternative to prison programs are integral to increasing safety in the district and to actually reducing crime and treating the behavior of those committing crime. The age old adage is that “people that know better, do better” and it has been proven in communities outside of New York City for decades. Calls to defund the police should be viewed as calls to increase services in areas where services are lacking to prevent the necessity of over-policing. The NYPD, due to its inflated budget, is called upon to treat all social ills as criminal acts and this simply should not be the case. The police are here to protect and officers are not social workers or trained interveners in mental health crises, nor should they be called upon to act as such. And yet, sadly, they are, and this increases the lack of safety in communities where fear of police violence will prohibit residents from calling for assistance. We encourage the funding of programs outside of NYPD that will increase community and social capital and make it easier for residents to find the help they need and call upon the entities that are fully trained to handle these crises.  ","Other - Write In (Required)","","Transportation matters was recognized as a top priority for District 8 residents, and three different areas were identified as requiring improvement.    Firstly, seniors noticed that ableist perspectives on bike and pedestrian prioritization hampers their ability to travel as buses are rerouted to accommodate Open Streets (primarily along Vanderbilt Avenue). They noted that lengthy wait times between buses creates unnecessary obstacles to getting to appointments and running errands. Compounding matters are NYC Transit’s proposed changes to the Brooklyn Bus Network that would increase walking distances between bus stops, many of which already lack shelter and seating. Those living with mobility issues are expressly concerned that they are being abused at the whim of those that are more able to travel via alternative methods such as bicycles, on train, and by foot. Rail travel is not an option for many seniors they stated, because not enough of the train stations in District 8 are ADA accessible with elevators or escalators.    Secondly, bicyclists identified a dearth of north/south bike infrastructure in District 8. While all recognized the more economically affluent western end of the District as “blessed with bike infrastructure,” all noted that their travel is not solely confined to Prospect Heights, and encouraged additional bike lanes and traffic calming in the central and eastern portion of the Board. Specifically cited corridors of interest were Albany, Troy, and Schenectady Avenues, with desires to see the one-way roads converted to one travel lane with a designated bike lane and two parking lanes. The concern raised is that the limited bike infrastructure increases risk as well as heightens disparities between more affluent communities and those still within distressed census tracts. Several individuals that commented indicated that there is no less bike activity in Crown Heights and Weeksville, and as such, the prioritization should not be just in Prospect Heights.     Moreover, several cyclists called into question certain components of the Dept. of Transportation’s streetscape changes designed to increase biker and pedestrian safety as actually deteriorating it. Quite a few mentioned the design of the Buffalo Avenue protected bike lane as a prime example of design changes that limit safety not only of cyclists, but also pedestrians and drivers, providing as examples of design flaws the following: 1) the lack of a mid-block crossing light for pedestrians to access both sides of Lincoln Terrace Park when using the comfort station; 2) the narrowed width of the driving and parking lanes on Buffalo Avenue to accommodate two protected bike lanes rather than a north/south protected bike lane on one side of the street; and 3) the “floating parking lane” that forces drivers to exit their vehicles into oncoming traffic. Street users of all kinds questioned whether the design changes as currently implemented actually accommodate the intended protective measures. Additionally, the recently enhanced Underhill Avenue Bike Boulevard called into question several of the same concerns, especially the fact that the street’s travel lane(s) were narrowed so significantly that bikers do not feel safe riding outside of the protected area that only spans a third of the corridor.   Thirdly, residents cited “hostile vehicle infrastructure” as a primary concern in terms of transportation matters. Several residents classified the following as hostile changes to make it more difficult to travel and maneuver by car in the city: 1) road diets inclusive of bike lanes and select bus service; 2) wanton removal of parking spaces for planters and other street furniture that they do not understand the purpose of; 3) removal of parking spaces to accommodate bike shares rather than bike parking for those that own their bikes; and 4) removal of parking spaces for car share programs such as Zip Car. While all complainants recognize climate change as a key driver behind the mantra that city residents need to drive less, most do not understand why city officials are increasing hostile infrastructure changes prior to focusing on changes and improvements to public transportation that would automatically decrease vehicular reliance amongst residents, and believe they are being unfairly burdened by electeds’ desires to fix climate issues by repression rather than holding big business accountable.    Finally, the fourth area of concern in transportation related matters brought to the Board’s attention is the increase in illegal moped use, the rise in electronic bicycles, and the wanton and brazen flouting of traffic laws by users of these modes of transport. With oversight and licensing, these modes of transportation could serve as a valuable tool for transportation options aside from personal carbon emitting vehicles. Unfortunately, such oversight and licensing is lacking, and irresponsible use wreaks havoc on our streets and sidewalks. We encourage requisite agencies to please look into legislation that will make our streets safer for all that use them, including those that currently lack the faculties to increase their own safety by utilizing common sense.  ","","","","","Mental health and substance abuse treatment and prevention programs","","The aftermath of the Covid-19 Pandemic brought to light many glaring issues and unattended conditions for our residents. Consequently, the dearth of understanding surrounding mental health issues can no longer be ignored. Chronically endured mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, anger (mis)management issues, borderline personality disorder, extreme mood changes, withdrawal and detachments, and so many more are more and more prevalent with social and environmental conditions deteriorating as they are currently. War abroad, mounting hostilities on the home front, declining finances, rising self-medicating tactics, shame around individualized perceptions of mental illness can have profound effects on the human psyche as well as lead to increased self-medicating with illicit substances and alcohol, thus creating a vicious cycle of increased debilitating mental health conditions. Additionally, susceptibility and lack of coping mechanisms can be traced back to unhealed trauma experienced at some point in a person's life. The reliance on things to sway the mind from things a person does not want to deal with merely increases the mental burdens and mental load carried. Understanding the intricacies of what mental health is and reducing the stigma around it should be a top priority, especially in the wake of the Covid-19 Pandemic where more and more people are in need of, and seeking treatment.","We encourage additional one stop-shop clinics and health care centers that provide many if not all health care services of a hospital. Facilities such as these that offer simple outpatient minor surgery, health screenings, dialysis, asthma treatment, MRIs and CT scans, walk-in services, etc., are a great addition to the community, especially since our District does not have a hospital. While we are not advocating for such small care medical centers to replace hospital care, they are convenient, easily accessible, and provide relatively affordable and necessary services to many residents that otherwise would not seek medical care, and especially to those that lack health insurance. In addition to these centers, we hope they will offer more comprehensive mental health and substance abuse care/preventative services.  ","A growing and often neglected population, our senior population requires special services and care that should come automatically to a class of well-deserving citizens. We need to recognize and reward the life lived and hard work of our senior population by providing them with fundamental means of existing above the Federal poverty line. Sadly, an easy lifestyle, even with modest furnishings, is not afforded to many seniors living in New York City due to astronomically high rents (resulting in housing insecurity), rising medical and health costs, increasing property tax burdens, and inflation causing rising food costs. As proponents of elderly care and in recognition of the special needs of the elderly in District 8, we appeal to a course of action that will make this goal possible. More services focused on improving the quality of life, residential opportunities, home-care and health-care need to be provided by City-operated and neighborhood based agencies. Services should especially focus on the ignored and forgotten portion of seniors that earn too much to be eligible for Medicaid and other cost savings programs like SCRIE, DRIE, senior property tax exemptions, and others. No senior should be grouped with working residents to compete for so-called affordable housing opportunities that will further eliminate financial security.   We acknowledge the City's efforts to increase eligibility for certain services such as the Senior Citizen- or Disabled- Rent Increase Exemption (SCRIE and DRIE) and property tax breaks by raising the maximum yearly income. However, more needs to be done, for to be eligible for these programs, seniors must still bear a large cost burden. SCRIE and DRIE should be available to every senior, not just those that are paying more than 30% of their gross income in rent. Factors such as taxes on income, healthcare insurance costs, medical and prescription copays, basic necessities, and the like need to be factored in as well, since it is net income that is the livable income.   Additionally, an emphasis on home-care will help reduce costly institutional care and the burdens placed upon family members that serve as caregivers, and will also provide additional freedom to relatively self-sufficient individuals. Finally, the movement toward virtual and digital during the Covid-19 Pandemic and the aftermath we are currently in, has illustrated that many seniors are very capable of using technology if they have the tools and education available to them. We must consider ensuring that every senior has a device that will allow them to stay connected to their loved ones and social networks, especially in situations where we have to isolate and distance for safety. ","Affordable housing and limiting landlord greed will assist with dispelling homelessness. Ensuring that housing is affordable begins by looking at the net pay that tenants have available to spend on rent, not gross. Additionally, other practices that assist homeless individuals is ensuring that other social and mental needs are met. This occurs by creating a healthy and safe community where social and community capital are grown and utilized to assist residents long before they need the intervention of the government.  ","There are many conditions that affect a person's life as a result of being ""low-income"" or impoverished. Poverty can create considerable stress for families. As per the family stress model, poverty can contribute to interparental conflict, which plays a key role in family dynamics and can be a precursor to negative child outcomes. Conflict can also arise between children and parents because of economic pressures. For example, children may resent parents for having to work late or not being able to provide small luxuries. Furthermore, the living conditions associated with poverty - notably overcrowded housing and housing instability - can negatively affect all family relationships.   Furthermore, poverty can make it difficult for parents to maintain a work-life balance that allows them to spend time at home caring for their children and to be active and involved with school, extracurricular activities, and community life. Parents on a low income are more likely to work long hours in precarious jobs that do not provide basic supports like parental leave and sick pay. Low-income workers typically also have less flexibility and choice than other parents (for example, they must rely on public transportation and do not have access to work-from-home options). This increases impact on family dynamics.    Studies have proven that increases in family income can boost children's educational achievements, and emotional and physical wellbeing. Low-income or poverty stricken individuals also often have additional preventable health maladies as a result. As with children, adults who live in poverty experience worse health outcomes, including higher mortality rates and increased risk of mental health conditions (e.g. depression, substance use disorders). The stress of poverty, coupled with inadequate health care access and limited financial resources for treatment in low-income communities, further exacerbates health conditions and makes parenting even more challenging.   Support via programs in the areas of social services must include addiction treatment options and counseling to help people understand that their perceived failures are not worth the risk of their health, well-being, and relationships. HRA/DSS must work with DOHMH to create these programs.   Finally, our elderly must be properly cared for to ensure their safety from abuse and predatory behavior. Services to help educate them, their neighbors, and friends of the signs and symptoms of elder abuse and education to prevent falling victim to scams are very much needed. ","","","","","After school programs","","The lack of afterschool programs leading the City’s youth to have few recreational activities with observation or even instruction has led to an increase in the number of kids engaging in mischievous activities out of boredom. We encourage the creation of myriad recreational options for kids inclusive of STEM programs, sports activities beyond the traditional basketball and football (i.e., tennis, dance, hockey, ice skating, chess, gaming, etc.), non-sports or STEM centered recreational activities (i.e., reading rooms, art spaces to learn about self expression, talk sessions for those with social anxiety, theater/drama, gaming, etc. to enjoy after school. Not only will these programs assist them with their social and educational development, but they will also garner interests outside of their normal home experiences.    Furthermore, as the impact of over two years of inconsistent educational delivery comes into better focus, after school programs can be utilized to help those children that suffered most educationally during the extended Covid-19 Pandemic and its aftermath to begin to catch up without the burden of feeling like they are drowning in school and school work. The programs can be implemented surreptitiously in such a way that kids are learning without feeling like they are in an educational setting. This allows them to keep their focus on having fun, all the while receiving beneficial education services to help them catch up to state-mandated levels of achievement.  ","We urge the Dept. of Education to do more to ensure educational equity for all students. The Covid-19 Pandemic and its aftermath continues to shine light on numerous disparities in our education system ranging from lack of technology in schools, teacher preparation and skill, parental involvement, etc. Sadly, more than a year post the pandemic, there does not seem to be much movement toward equitable education. While it would be foolish to expect the DOE to be able to remedy everything a student faces that enables systemic biases, there are indeed things the department can do to ensure at the very least that all students have the necessary basics for new learning platforms. This includes working with teachers to discover exactly what they (the teacher) need to better educate students. Sometimes, training alone on a broad scale without taking into consideration the myriad experiences of classroom teachers is not the most necessary thing. The teacher inside the classroom has the baseline knowledge of their students' needs and can tell you how they as teachers could be more successful in their craft in helping students learn.   Please note that the above is not stated to shift attention from professional training for teachers, especially recognizing the importance of training in learning new protocols and modalities of education created by the NYS Board of Regents. We applaud the efforts and strides of our teachers and the work they embrace outside of their standard title of classroom teacher, and have much gratitude for them and the work they do. To better assist our teachers, we encourage the DOE to consider implementing intersectional tactics and methodologies to increase understanding of students' experiences for quality educational services. This in turn will guarantee that as many students as possible, including the most underserved that lack basic resources in their home and extended community, are able to achieve academic success. The solution is beyond just smaller class sizes (which are indeed a necessity) and working to increase parent/teacher cooperation (another necessity).  Part of the solution can also be recognizing that children ought to be introduced to different learning styles and modalities to accommodate those that are incapable of learning in the standard educational way and are made to feel like a failure. Diversity on preparing training and listening to teacher need is a must.  Finally, the elimination of snow days for New York City students created a swift need for technological enhancements in our students' education. The DOE must ensure that students possess the requisite electronic device in the home and also the broadband tools necessary to operate them to learn effectively from home. Classrooms equipped with audio visual equipment for videoconferencing will also allow sick students to participate in their school day without exposing their classmates to illness. We must invest heavily in the technological advances that make learning fun and easy to prevent underprivileged students from being left behind. ","The Covid-19 Pandemic and its waning endemic phase has put more children in harm's way as tensions and anxiety levels remains heightened. We do not know the long-term effects of the Pause on children, family dynamics, and mental health, but we advocate for, and encourage additional resources for parents with children.   ","","","","","Fire safety","","There have been several deadly fires in Community Board 8, one of the  most recent a fire that cost three generations of lives in one family. Several fires that caused entire buildings to be vacated and declared uninhabitable have also occurred.   District 8 residents cannot afford to relive the era of New York City where fires and being burned out were tools and measures employed by unscrupulous landlords. Nor can they afford to not know simple things to keep themselves and their neighbors safe. If the FDNY has noticed an uptick in fires related to unsafe batteries on electronic bikes or faulty electronics and appliances imported from foreign countries, it is imperative that residents be properly trained and notified of how dangerous their purchasing choices can be.   The fire at 242 Albany Avenue that caused three generations from one family to perish was found to have been caused by a lithium ion battery. These batteries are common and popular for electronic devices and e-bikes and other personal modes of transportation. People across the city need to know precisely how dangerous unsupported battery charging can be and also informed on precisely what to look for in terms of electrical classifications to make the right choice for themselves and their families. Education is paramount to help constituents understand what UL ratings mean and why they are important, and also ensuring that rechargeable batteries are certified safe.  ","The last two+ years has led to a marked increase in nuisance crime complaints often overlooked by the Precinct commands. For instance, dangerous and illegal scooters, e-bikes, and mopeds on sidewalks,  complaints of late-night stoop gatherings, gatherings in front of parks/playgrounds or vacant lots, gatherings on corners in front of shuttered stores, drug activity (both increased open marijuana use and other more illicit drugs), open container and public drunkenness, lewd and lascivious behavior, nudity and genitalia exposure, and so many more-skyrocketed in our district. The general locations of many of these complaints remained the same despite different residents seeking assistance.     Furthermore, the more heavily populated eastern side of Community Board 8 has a strong need for additional patrol. In particular, the area bounded by Troy Avenue and Ralph Avenue from Atlantic Avenue to Eastern Parkway, especially the blocks of Sterling and Park Places, is especially problematic in terms of violent crime and gun violence. This area possesses a dearth of quality experiential activities and services proven to dispel crime. Consequently, in addition to additional police officers for the 77th and 78th Precincts and PSA #2 to effectively monitor the community and NYCHA developments and surrounding problem areas like the eastern end of the District, we advocate for additional social service programs and mental health provisions. ","Due to rising preventable medical illnesses among residents in District 8 and a continuously upward movement of those suffering from respiratory illnesses, an increased need for EMS vehicles has presented itself to our residents. Unfortunately, the percentage of residents that require emergency medical services directly correspond to those without health insurance or with minimal health insurance, thus exacerbating the issue of their medical conditions. Moreover, addicted residents have relied on medical intervention to prevent death by overdose and thus need additional services. ","","","","","Organic waste collection","","Organic matter in the waste stream produces the most greenhouse gases. Diverting organics from landfills and incinerators is key to the City’s 2050 emission and greenhouse gas reduction goals. According to a 2017 DSNY Waste Characterization Study, 34% of waste in the DSNY waste stream is composed of organics suitable for composting. Furthermore, this same study asserts that schools have the potential to divert as much as 86% of their waste for recycling or composting thru DSNY curbside collections.  Sadly however, despite this information being repeated from the 2013 study and actually increasing, the city still currently diverts less than 1% of organic waste away from landfills.    We applaud the expansion of curbside compost collection and mandatory leaf and yard waste separation in the borough of Brooklyn, and believe this will go a long way in assisting the city in reducing its carbon emissions and becoming more sustainable. However, we recognize additional measures that can be taken to assist the city with its lofty goals as outlined in the City of Yes Initiatives. Of primacy is resident education about what organic waste is and why composting is an integral component of reducing climate change. This will increase voluntary participation and help the city achieve its target numbers.    Moreover, each neighborhood must have the capacity to process its own food scraps. Community scale compost sites create sustainable green jobs for local residents and provide valuable compost for our neighborhood soils. Food Scrap Drop Offs (FSDOs) allow residents to divert and instead, compost their food scraps. We request support for sustainability programs at each school and organics/compost outreach programs and education resources for local residents and business owners. We encourage organics drop-off sites be increased beyond the standard community garden to include local subway stations and sanitation garages. Furthermore, we reiterate our desire for community biodigesters to not only create employment and training opportunities, but also to have other locations for organics drop-offs, while creating sustainable and well-paying jobs and renewable energy. ","Well before flash floods became a scary reality for residents of New York City, complaints of basement flooding and ponding around certain intersections and uneven roadways had dramatically increased in District 8. The Right of Way Bioswale (raingarden) installation projects continuing throughout the city are designed to assist with runoff and flooding for sewers not equipped to handle the quantity of water and sewage running through the system. Unfortunately, these bioswales are neither well maintained nor adequate to handle the growing strain on our aging sewer system.   There has been an increase in installation of infiltration basins and stormwater greenstreets across the city. However, the stormwater greenstreets often receive the same lack of care and maintenance as raingardens. We hope that the city allocates funds to improve these methods and employ others to assist with runoff and water waste. Such methods include the provision of incentives for homeowners and developers to use living roofs and property walls, or utilizing rain barrels to collect water rather than gutters to allow it to drain off flat surfaces. A concerning trend in District 8 is the fact that many residents prefer to concrete over their front and back yards in an effort to reduce the possibility of any vegetation attracting rodents rather than having plantings that allow for permeability and water absorption. What is not understood is that all of this concrete is impermeable and increases the runoff to the sewer, and also fails to deter rodent activity but instead provides them with undisturbed hidden places to rapidly propagate. Incentives for green space serves several valuable environmental purposes not only limited to reducing runoff and overburdening the system.     Unfortunately, this form does not allow us to specifically request funding for the maintenance of bioswales or funding for homeowners to create green roofs or gardens. However, to reiterate: we advocate for incentives for homeowners to create green roofs and as much vegetation on their property as possible to absorb rain water. We also advocate for increasing the size of tree pits to not only allow for root growth, but also to increase the amount of permeable surfaces in the city's concrete jungle. ","CB 8 is cognizant of the fact that budget cuts have hampered DSNY operations and will continue to do so for at the least this fiscal year and possibly the next. However, a recent spike in DSNY related complaints such as missed collections, late collections, the sweeper not coming through the block, and overflowing corner baskets disallow us from being able to remain silent on the issue. Garbage feeds rats, and District 8 considers itself a community at the forefront of the rodent debacle. We implore DSNY to improve services, utilize new systems for cleaning such as employing Billy Goat curbside litter cleaners, mandating containerized waste storage, employing front loading garbage trucks for large garbage containers, and to work with the community, business owners, and property owners on solutions to the mounting trash issue.  ","","","","","Neighborhood preservation","","Community Board 8 members and residents alike often feel as though the community has been inundated with hyper development. The creation of multiple historic districts to preserve the charming housing integrity of our housing stock has not truncated the excessive development. We believe that Developers have targeted the ""underbuilt"" according to zoning laws historic districts and are seeking to increase their profits by converting the two and three family homes into five or more condominiums by adding extensions and cutting floors. All available lot space is being turned into luxury housing. Larger lots in the M1 zone are being sought for zoning variances outside of the scope and use as designed by the CB 8 MCROWN Committee and submitted to the Dept. of City Planning. Developers are buying residential air rights to increase the size and scope of their development projects at the detriment of residents who do not understand what it means to sell their air rights.    Neighborhood preservation is not about preventing development; it is, instead, about retaining the essence of the community as residents have come to know it. Granted, there will always be change and improvements that serve at that time; however, long term effects of hyper development are too dangerous to consider to allow the massive development to continue in our boundaries. While some believe that the only way to solve the affordability crisis is to create more housing and glut the market, the majority of our members do not agree that this is the way. Reports are indicating a massive exit of residents from the City to other areas with more space; now is the time for us to look into preserving the housing stock we have instead of building more that might not be necessary and that has the potential to turn fallow. There are many alternative ways to increase housing. We encourage the city to look into these alternatives. ","Land Use is a touchy subject for many in our district. There are many competing ideologies on how land should be used with some individuals believing that open air and open spaces are overrated, thus disregarding concerns of hyper density and large development projects. Some of these individuals further believe that over-development is the only way to assure that each New Yorker is housed, using the ""trickle down housing"" premise that a glutted real estate market will drive prices down. On the other side of the land use debate are those that believe in neighborhood preservation, keeping intact the fabric of what makes a neighborhood great and utilize the ""neighborhood"" moniker. It is undeniable that District 8, especially the manufacturing portion of the community, is a very desirable location for development. ULURP applications have increased manyfold in the last year, with private development and zoning change projects causing much friction between residents. There is valid concern that District 8 will go the same way as Downtown Brooklyn and become unrecognizable. We still believe, however, that if the Board's MCROWN proposal, last approved and re-ratified in 2019 and submitted to the Dept. of City Planning, would prove beneficial for our district in terms of not only development, but commercial revitalization as well. Consequently, we urge DCP's adoption of the MCROWN proposal to assist us in designing for the future while preserving our community.  ","We urge the City to consider using derelict, fallow structures for affordable housing opportunities rather than selling community gardens and taking away green space for small scale development projects. Property owners should be held accountable for their property and should know that if they refuse to take care of it, there is the possibility that they can lose it to address a grave need at truly affordable rates, not inflated rates that are grossly unaffordable. We believe that a proper accounting of vacant NYCHA units should be done, especially considering the dire need for affordable units. A number of years ago, Comptroller Scott Stringer released an audit report stating that over 4,000 NYCHA units sit empty because they have been deemed uninhabitable while awaiting various repairs. These units must be repaired immediately and made available for occupation as soon as possible as they are truly affordable housing for families. It is saddening that we have thousands of families living in temporary shelters when there are over 4,000 vacant NYCHA units that could be used for permanent housing if only they were habitable. Demolition by neglect is inhumane and immoral and should be deterred by any means necessary.  Furthermore, we call upon our local lawmakers to seriously consider the issue of arbitrary market rate rents that developers force on a community. The city needs to take a hard-line stance on the amount of rent that can be charged to prevent displacement of residents and financial strain from rent burdens. Following the federal guidelines for the Area Median Income based on gross income is not feasible in a city with a high standard of living such as New York City. Competition is great for the few so-called affordable units that are available, and the families most in need are ineligible usually because of poor credit. Our elected officials need to step in and institute policy changes that address the glaring and blatant greed of developers that are decimating the housing market in New York City. We believe that the Mayor and City Council have the ability to enact legislation that can help reduce this financial burden by capping rent rates that developers can charge, especially when they enter certain underdeveloped or underprivileged communities. No one should be at risk of displacement, and consequently, our local government needs to do a better job of ensuring that no one faces this danger. ","The Covid-19 Pandemic has shown how untenable and unsustainable high commercial rents can be on valued commercial strips. With more and more hospitality businesses closing permanently and fewer shops and boutiques able to meet overhead costs of a brick and mortar, we are seeing more commercial vacant spaces than in the last 10 years. We understand that private property allows property owners to charge what they desire, but we also encourage EDC to work with businesses and potential business owners on ways to remain in business. This can include more incubator spaces, more facilities such as Industry City and the Brooklyn Navy Yard, and also shared spaces for restaurants and bars. It is time to start thinking of new ways to assist small businesses. ","","","","","Traffic safety and enforcement (cars, scooters, ebikes, etc.)","","During the last 12 months, complaints about illegal scooters, e-bikes, unlicensed and unregistered mopeds, electric skateboards, double parked vehicles, vehicles not moving during alternate side cleaning hours, bikers disobeying traffic laws and riding on sidewalks and against traffic, and the like have skyrocketed in District 8. These complaints are serious enough to warrant additional enforcement by all agencies with oversight capabilities, especially as the City moves further toward increasing personal mobility options in a movement away from the personal vehicle. While the emphasis on enforcement has been on vehicle drivers, we encourage shifting the emphasis to alternative mobility users to help users recognize their agency in sharing the road and keeping everyone safe.   We encourage the NYC Dept. of Transportation to apply corresponding safety measures in locations where calming has occurred. For instance, pedestrians have stated that they feel unsafe on roadways crossing many streets because of unsurety of crossing signals, with many citing their confusion around Leading Pedestrian Intervals (LPI) not indicating how much time they have left to cross when crossing a street. Several residents have stated that they have been nearly hit by vehicles because they had “grown weary of looking silly” waiting to cross when they have 7 seconds or longer to make their way across the street, then wind up getting almost hit by vehicles when they are midway through the street. Drivers have complained of the length of time they sit at delayed red lights for the duration of LPIs, which then decrease the number of vehicles that can move through the light during each change, which consequently causes traffic backups. This is on top of almost hitting pedestrians that do not realize how much or how little time they still have to cross the street and start crossing just as the light turns green for cars to drive. We urge the Dept. of Transportation to remediate this problem, and one of the simplest ways the department can do this is to install countdown clocks at every LPI intersection and let pedestrians crossing in either direction know exactly how much time is left before the light changes.    We advocate for equitable road use and enforcement of personal vehicles. Any operators of a motor vehicle whether with two wheels or with three, four, or more,  must be held accountable for their actions, not just car owners. A total disregard for road rules or pedestrian safety by bikers and riders of e-scooters/bikes/mopeds can cause just as many dangerous collisions and as much damage to human life as can a car or truck. We urge increased enforcement of ALL scofflaw road users.  ","While we recognize that streets are a shared space between pedestrians, cyclists, drivers, and others, our community feels that there needs to be more equitable streetscape changes. Street designs and redesigns need to be completed in such a way as to make sense for everyone, not just a select few. For instance, the recently redesigned Underhill Avenue Bike Boulevard disallows for adequate municipal service delivery to residents as the narrowed streetscape prevents snowplows from properly clearing the street, and also disallows DSNY trucks to properly service the containerized trash for PS 9. The result has been that PS 9 has reverted to simply piling waste bags curbside rather than a container to reduce rodents, and that municipal trash collectors have to drag bags and bins down a street to a corner on a side street where the truck awaits. This is unacceptable, and as such, we implore the agency do a better job in streetscape designs to ensure accommodation of municipal service machinery. ","Many seniors, and people with disabilities and/or mobility issues rely on bus service and Access-A-Ride to travel to avoid the stairs of train stations. It becomes disheartening knowing that some people prefer to remain home rather than attempt to rely upon unreliable bus service in District 8 or are unable to leave due to their ride share company not being able to access their street. We request better service along our bus lines, especially during non-peak hours and weekends, as well as a recalculation of Open Street/Restaurants and other traffic calming initiatives that reduce vehicular access to streets. Furthermore, as more housing is built in District 8 (a recent study found that 1 in every 10 new units of housing created in New York City is in either Prospect Heights or Crown Heights), it is imperative that additional subway and bus service be provided to accommodate our growing community.        ","","","","","Community board resources (offices, staff, and equipment)","","Community Boards are the first advocates for community residents facing issues with other city agencies, but have not had an increase in the budget in decades. It is our charter mandated duty to interface with community residents and city municipalities to ensure service delivery in a timely manner. 311 is not an adequate substitution for the interaction of community boards and community residents. Residents increasingly complain about the difficulty of obtaining useful and accurate information from the 311 system concerning resolution of complaints submitted via the central hotline and other general questions. The net result of the 311 hotline has been stagnation in service delivery and complaint resolution. We hope the Mayor and City Council see fit to increase the budget for community boards so that we can fulfill our Charter mandated duties.","The last few years has shown us just how crucial the need is for safe and well-maintained parks and playgrounds. Regular maintenance programs and adequate manpower is essential. Currently, maintenance staff needs to be increased for all our Parks and Playgrounds, malls along Eastern Parkway, and the St. John's Recreation Center. Additional Playground Associates, Park Enforcement Officers, and other personnel are required to keep all park users free from harassment and dangerous elements that lurk in unguarded areas. It has been proven that with personnel in our parks, more people respect the rules of the park/playground and behave accordingly, such as leashing their dogs, cleaning up after themselves, and not engaging in public nuisance activities like drinking and smoking. As more people became pet owners during the extended Covid-19 Pandemic, the need for a dog run in the district has increased. In fact, a survey in August 2022 indicates that respondents are very much in favor of a dog run in the District, and as such, we urge the Parks Department to create a space for dogs in one or more locations of District 8. ","We urge the City to continue its financial support for the renovation of our cultural institutions. The Brooklyn Children's Museum (BCM) is one of New York City's unique educational and cultural treasures. Since its inception in 1899, it has been recognized for educational excellence and innovation and has had strong local and national impact while attendance continues to grow. Funding is required to complete necessary repairs and upgrades, and is also needed to maintain operating hours for the museum and staff levels at a livable wage. Weeksville Heritage Center (WHC) is another cultural jewel in District 8. The educational center and office space should further enhance the eastern end of the District. WHC is a multi-dimensional museum dedicated to preserving the history of the 19th century African American community of Weeksville, Brooklyn. Using a contemporary lens, the center activates this unique history through the presentation of innovative, vanguard and experimental programs.  ","In recent years, the three public library systems serving NYC have been threatened annually with drastic cuts. Libraries provide job seekers assistance, adult literacy, English as a Second Language, computer training, tax preparation, US Passport processing, fine arts exhibits, access to the internet, and serve as a repository for historic material. They do so much more than allow people to read books even though this component of services is much needed. The library system requires investment of funding to ensure proper service delivery and access to residents of all ages, backgrounds, and needs. ","Community Boards are the first advocates for community residents facing issues with other city agencies, but have not had an increase in the budget in decades. It is our charter mandated duty to interface with community residents and city municipalities to ensure service delivery in a timely manner. 311 is not an adequate substitution for the interaction of community boards and community residents.

Our geographical border consists of Eastern Parkway to the north, Washington and Ocean Avenues to the west, Clarkson Avenue to the south, and Utica, Rochester, and East New York Avenues to the east. Community District 9 is home to prominent cultural and academic institutions which include Prospect Park, Brooklyn Museum, Jewish Children's Museum and Medgar Evers College.  Brooklyn Community Board 9 is one of the most diverse districts in the borough with approximately 52% of the district identifying as Black/ African America; 28% identifying as White/Caucasian; 10% identifying as Hispanic; 2.5% identifying as Asian; and 40% of the district population is foreign born. It is important to note within these racial demographic nationalities and cultures that add to the cultural diversity and richness of our district and Central Brooklyn.    As a Community Board, it is our responsibility to bring focus to issues affecting or that could affect the welfare of the district. We ask the City to finally prioritize the needs of this district needs statement as they underscore the voice and priorities of the community.  As District Manager of the Community Board, I would like to thank the Board staff for their countless hours to the community and Borough of Brooklyn.  ","","","","","Affordable Housing","","Affordable housing remains an issues in our district. New construction is not meeting the demand for affordability needed for this area and seems to favor households with higher incomes. We need true affordable housing that is relative to the district's median income and actually affordable for current residents. The cost of real estate in Central Brooklyn, especially Crown Heights, has skyrocketed over the past decade. According to NYC Equitable Development Data Explorer, 2017-2021, 44% of the occupied units paying rent population in the district were occupied by low-income (51% - 80% AMI) households. The same database shows between 2014 -2023 new construction created 232 units for extremely low-income (0% - 30% AMI), 50 units for very low-income (31% - 50% AMI), and 329 units for low-income (51% - 80% AMI) resulting in the creation of 611 total units for households with low-income designations. Supporting the statement new construction is not meeting the affordability threshold for current residents, 585 units of new construction was created for middle-income (81% - 120% AMI) households.   Equitable Development Data Explorer https://equitableexplorer.planning.nyc.gov/data/district/4011/hsaq/tot ","Infrastructure resiliency","","Infrastructure resiliency remains a major issue throughout the district. Infrastructure resiliency includes street conditions/roadway, street bridge, mass transit maintenance and infrastructure; street flooding; maintenance and cleanliness of institutions, natural assets, and public space. Flooding has been a chronic issue mostly affecting homeowners throughout the district. DEP should work directly with the community board and homeowners who experience chronic flooding due to outdated infrastructure to create a plan to address flooding across the district.   Brooklyn Community Board 9, separate from residents, but in the same spirit, have been requesting traffic mitigating measures to address speeding on our streets throughout the district. Requests submitted by the community board and by our constituents for speed bumps and additional traffic calming measures around the district have languished in the ""study"" phase for years or have been denied by the NYC Department of Transportation Brooklyn's Borough Office for not ""meeting"" citing criteria. With what seems to be a lack of overall enforcement for violators violating local laws, residents are worried about the consistent speeding of vehicles taking place on an innumerable amount of streets also affect adjacent community districts. Although we have witnessed a small number of installations of  pedestrian ramps, turn signals and speed cameras in the district, there is no coordinated effort to integrate any recommendations of the Community Board or constituents.  While the Brooklyn Bus Redesign and the Flatbush Priority Project provide opportunities to address current and longstanding issues pertaining to bus and train service, the projects must focus on future population growth and brick and mortar development.   With the rise in the older adult population and Aging In Place initiatives passing council, its imperative our community already has the infrastructure in place to accommodate the future growth and development of the borough. The overall lack of ADA accessibility, it is necessary the MTA consider older adults and person(s) with disability(ies) populations into its planning. ONLY three (3) out of our eleven (11) MTA train stations are ADA accessible, limiting access to public transportation for individuals with disabilities and older adults. ","Trash removal and cleanliness","","In our FY25 District Needs community survey, unsanitary sidewalk conditions was noted more than any other issue. Overflowing trash cans, the lack of trash receptacles, missed garbage collection, and increased rodent sightings were all patterned submissions throughout our district needs survey. The City needs to prioritize the sanitation budget to ensure our communities remain habitable spaces for residents and guests. Negative street and sidewalk conditions on the corridors of Flatbush, Nostrand, Rogers, Bedford, Kingston, and Utica Avenues hinder these corridors from seeing or meeting its economic potential. There are 0 BIDs or active merchant associations housed in CD9 to fund supplemental cleaning services along our commercial strips meaning we need the City to take a more active approach to educate small business owners on their cleaning to the curb responsibilities. Sanitation is a quality of life issue we all share. Our streets deserve to be clean and free of bags and garbage like other neighbors in this city. If the City is unable to provide adequate funding due to the ongoing asylum crisis affecting the city, the State of New York should work with the city to creating funding avenues to address the gaps in service. AFTER ALL, WE ARE ALL NEW YORKERS. ","","","","","Access to healthy food and lifestyle programs","","Ethnic minority groups experience high rates of poor health and disease for a range of health conditions. We need an infusion of programming that promotes healthier eating and health screenings, and provides access to healthy education in our schools, libraries, and throughout the district and surrounding communities. The South Crown Heights and Prospect Leffert's Gardens neighborhood's adult obesity rate is 30%, which is 5% higher than the City percentage. The hypertension rate for the same area is 33% compared to a 27% hypertension rate citywide. Access to spaces that promote healthy programming and healthy lifestyle is a start to addressing the health disparities in our community. ","Education in healthcare remains  the most vital tool in combating chronic conditions such as cancer, diabetes and asthma that effect an alarming portion of the population of the district. Funding is needed to enhance the education/outreach efforts that help connect community members to the resources they need to lead healthier lives. ","Many adults fear losing self-sufficiency as they age, senior centers are a pivotal part of their social live and a home base of sorts to obtain supportive services as they age in place.  We need continued and increased funding of our senior centers to enable them to offer a wide range of services information on health services, tech education, recreational activities, volunteer opportunities and other social interaction.  Fostering such environments allows for the preservation of dignity, promotion of independence and the inclusion of a  social support system thereby reducing loneliness and depression.   ","Shelters have continued to installed in Community Board 9 without funding allocated to provide assisatance to the individuals that reide there.  We require more resources to handle the increased needs of this population. ","No comments","","","","","Other - Write In (Required)","","Community District 9 is dealing with major gaps in education. A real issue is our public school principals are not receiving enough funding to modernize their schools to make it competitive for students and resources. DOE District 17 completely engulfs the boundaries of Community District 9. Finding affordable after-school care remains a consistent hurdle for parents and guardians in our district. The need is so great that some parents choose schools based on after school offerings rather than academic integrity. Students need access to more cultural, academic, extracurricular, and economic programming to ensure they are equipped with the information and knowledge to succeed in school and thereafter. Per the Summer 2023 District 17 Data Summary Report, total enrollment in District 17 declined by 17% over the last five years and declined 5% last year alone. The same report states District 17 has the second lowest elementary school retention rate and the fourth lowest middle school retention rate in Brooklyn. Lastly, District 17 has the largest number of schools with an enrollment in the bottom 25% of schools citywide compared to other districts across the city. We ask the City to consider restoring the budget cuts from the education budget to ensure principals and school support have the resources they need to prepare the future generation of leaders in Brooklyn.  ","The schools in Community Board 9 need to reinvigorated. There needs to be increased funding of the IDEA, so that  students who require early intervention services can be identified and  serviced.  Many of our students get lost and left behind in a large classroom setting.  We need our class sizes reduced to allow for teacher to truly connect and monitor the progress of their students.   The Department of Education should create incentives to attract and retain personnel, including teachers, related services personnel, special education providers.       ","Community Board 9 does not have a space within its confines that is solely dedicated to youth engagement, such as a recreational center.  Our youth  must rely on afterschool and other community-based programs for arts, entertainment, sports and academic help. These programs are essential to the development of  life, learning and social skills of our youngest residents. The City must do more to support our children via an infusion of funding into community-based organizations. ","","","","","Police-community relations","","Although there have been strides to positively engage the community via the installation of Neighborhood Coordination Officers. The NYPD needs to double down in establishing themselves as a trusted community partner for our residents.  There is a lack of trust that leads to citizens being reluctant to report crimes because they are distrusting of the police. A number of respondents from our FY25 District Needs community surveys noted the lack of presence of the precinct as an overall concern. Per the Comptroller's Fair Share? Siting NYC's Municipal Facilities report, the 71st Precinct, which covers the entire community district, reported the worst response time to critical crimes of all NYPD precinct in Brooklyn, fifth citywide. As our district continues to grow in population and size of buildings being erected, its crucial the city directs funding and resources to the 71st Precinct to address the response time ranking and bolster community relations with the public. ","As in previous years, we are calling for an increase in funding for crime prevention programming to quell the gun violence in our neighborhood.  We continue to see the number of shootings proliferate and boldly take place in broad daylight. There should be an establishment of a strategic partnership between the local precinct, elected officials , community members and the Kings County District Attorney to effectively combat the escalating violence. ","No comments","","","","","Cleanliness/trash collection","","Community District 9 is suffering from overflowing garbage cans, an excessive amount of liter on sidewalks and street curbs, and increased rat and rodent sightings. To be clear, the NYC Department of Sanitation (BK9) garage is absolute fantastic and we want to thank them for working to keep our streets and sidewalks clean with minimal resources. Sanitation and unsanitary sidewalk and street conditions are brought to our attention nearly everyday. Another round of budget cuts are looming due to the ongoing asylum seeker crisis. Restoration of funding for DSNY, prioritizing collection frequency and ASP, is crucial to the cleanliness of our district and the wellbeing of those who visit it.  At spontaneous locations illegal dumping of household items and large furniture continues to be an issue. Installation of signage and possibly illegal dumping cameras could be cost efficient measures to improving unsanitary conditions overall in the district. ","The population in Community District 9 is increasing due to the conversions of one and two-family homes into multiple unit apartment dwellings. The sewer system is therefore being overburdened due to increased waste and water volumes. ","Sanitation enforcement needs to be more proactive in the issuance of violations when motorists do not adhere to the Alternate Side Parking rules and prevent the mechanical brooms from properly cleaning the streets.  Mechanical brooms should also be properly filled with water to prevent leaves and dirt from blowing back onto sidewalks.","","","","","Affordable housing creation","","Development taking place in the confines of Community District 9 is a true disservice to the community. Many residents have voiced the concern the designs of new construction buildings are out of context with what is now rows of single family homes. While on paper the number of ""affordable"" housing units in the district has increased, the units being constructed are out of scope with the income levels for residents. According to NYC Equitable Development Data Explorer, 2017-2021, 44% of the occupied units paying rent population in the district were occupied by low-income (51% - 80% AMI) households. The same database shows between 2014 -2023 new construction created 232 units for extremely low-income (0% - 30% AMI), 50 units for very low-income (31% - 50% AMI), and 329 units for low-income (51% - 80% AMI) resulting in the creation of 611 total units for households with low-income designations. Supporting the statement new construction is not meeting the affordability threshold for current residents, 585 units of new construction was created for middle-income (81% - 120% AMI) households. The ongoing displacement of long term tenants is a unfortunate ripple effect of development. Landlords continue to raise rents and provide sub-par repairs in hopes of pushing tenants out to earn more from higher rents. In order to maintain the character of our community, we need development that actually addresses the needs of the community. ","The residents of Community Board 9  live in a mix of housing of private homes and apartment buildings. The development in the district has taken place at breakneck speed, yet the pressures for affordable housing are persist. This district is disproportionately rent burdened.  Future development within  should take this into account, as previous use of the MIH program has been thoroughly abused.  ","The residents of Community Board 9 need truly affordable housing in order to remain apart of this community.   The majority of the residents of Community Board 9 are rent and utility burdened.  True legislative changes needs to be championed by our elected officials in order to introduce policy changes that address the over consumption by developers and the ravaging of the affordable housing market in New York City. ","The major commerical corridors of Utica, Kingston, Nostrand and Flatbush Avenues are a mix of newly opening busineses, struggling mom and pop shops and vacant store fronts. We need a reinvigoration of resources to support these businesses and keep them afloat.  ","","","","","Pedestrian safety (safer crossings, sidewalk management, etc.)","","The Board receives frequent complaints regarding traffic congestion, double parking, and the lack of enforcement to address these issues. The issues plague the major corridors of Flatbush, Ocean, Washington, Rogers, Nostrand, Kingston, and Utica Avenues.  Although there are no bus lanes on Empire Boulevard the bike lanes on are oftentimes inaccessible to cyclists due to commercial trucks, ambulettes, and regular vehicles double parking thus obstructing the bike lanes. There are a number of bike lanes in other district that terminal upon entering Community District 9. An expansion of bike lanes in other district could be the solution to a connected bike network in Central Brooklyn. Additional enforcement measures should be considered along our busy thoroughfares, in order to minimize traffic hazards, congestion, and deter double parking. We ask the City to be thoughtful and communicative as it creates its plan for a more inclusive and cohesive transportation network in Crown Heights. ","Proposals for bike lanes, pedestrian islands, and pedestrian plazas are more often than not initiated by DOT without the community and Board's input.  And in some instances where the Board's input is solicited and given, it's often not carefully considered and the Board's position is overruled.  DOT has also continuously rejected the Board's input/requests both overly and by ceasing communication for years on end.  For example, DOT started to develop a capital project in 2012 to reconstruct the historical Clove Road in response to community requests.  DOT's plan did not include restoration of the cobblestone. Although there were ongoing conversation between the Board and DOT concerning funding options for the restoration of the cobblestones because the Board did not fully support their plan, DOT ceased further communication about the project in 2014 and it stalled. Then, in August 2020, the Board received notice that DOT had not only approved a Clove Road Plaza proposal submitted by a community organization, but it was also funding the design and construction of the plaza. This was done without further input from the Board, and despite the fact that upon inquiring about the original project in 2018, the Board was informed by DOT that the project was no longer active.  Similarly, when the Utica/Empire Reconstruction project faced opposition from the community; particularly when it came to the closure of the triangle at Empire/Franklin/Washington and its conversion into a pedestrian plaza, DOT ceased communication about the project in 2017, and it too stalled.  Again during discussions about the project, community residents and the Board offered DOT suggestions for alleviating existing traffic hazards at the location, none of which were taken into consideration.  Then, in December 2019, the NYC DDC informed the Board of the scheduled project kick-off and anticipated completion dates for the Utica/Empire Boulevard Reconstruction Project, which was moving forward with the closure of the triangle.  DOT has proactively introduced initiatives not requested or supported by the community. While safety is paramount and community amenities are positive proposals, they must be carefully considered and community input must be highly valued.  DOT must provide updates as to how these projects were expedited without further input from the Board.  All types of ground transportation are important within the 1.7 square miles that comprise the district and where mean travel to work is approximately 45 minutes, nearly 10% of the residents walk or ride bikes to work, 70% take public transit, and 20% drive or carpool.  Traffic and road conditions are constant concerns. Of great concern is that there is no way to ascertain an overview of DOT traffic calming measures. There are currently over 100 DOT service delivery requests from our residential areas but no way to understand how implementation of all or any combination of these requests would impact traffic flow in the District.   Rather, such requests are considered only insofar as they impact the block for which they are requested. Many of these outstanding requests for speed humps that are normally denied after sometimes two or more years of waiting for DOT to provide an outcome without clear explanations.  Community Board 9 has requested that DOT do a traffic calming study of the district but, to date, DOT has not agreed to undertake one. ","There are six bus lines that operate within District 9, including express buses and select bus service routes.  Need live bus timers, bus shelters, and Citybenches at key bus stops on the B41, B43, B44/B44SBS, B46/B46SBS, B48 and B48 bus routes.  There are 12 subway stations in District 9.  With the exception of the ongoing Handicapped Accessibility renovation work the Brooklyn Museum/Botanical Garden subway station, no other subway station within District 9 has been included the MTA's 2020-2024 Capital Program plans for 70 new ADA-accessible stations.  The Board would like to see the adoption in the MTA Capital Plan for elevator services for subway stations within the District. ","","","","","Community board resources (offices, staff, and equipment)","","Brooklyn Community Board 9 is in need of a new office space to fulfill its charter mandated responsibilities and to accommodate supplemental services in the community. A new CB9 office would allow the board to easily hold committee meetings and community programming in the office. Ideally the space would serve as a quasi-community center for residents and local non-profits. We, along with other community-based organization in Crown Heights, are often looking for large spaces to hold public programming. The pandemic exacerbated the need for additional space as some non-profits and community groups have used our small office to conduct events for the public. The office is too small to accommodate required committee meetings and public hearings, especially for meetings of sensitive and controversial topics affecting the district. Current development across the district has not produced enough, in size and numbers, community space for programming. We ask DCAS to expedite our ALREADY SUBMITTED request for a new CB9 Office as it would be in the best financial interest of the board. ","As a community we continue to advocate for  better parks and playgrounds. Parks are an asset to our community  as they aid in child development, community engagement through family events, physical activities, and a resource for our educators and their students. ","CB9 has strong institutions that bring diverse programming and support services to residents of CB9.  ","The Brooklyn Public Library facilities serving the district continue to need additional funding to meet the demand for its services. ","Community Boards are provide to a voice and  be a conduit to  City government. The current operating budget is insufficient to effectively navigate the rising cost of operation, purchasing technology and maintenance of the aforementioned.  If Community Boards are to remain relevant, they need to able have access the latest technology in order to effectively engage their constituency.

Defining the southern and western borders of our district are the waters of the Verrazzano Narrows. To the North, the L.I.R.R./MTA railroad cut from the shoreline at 65th Street, proceeds eastward to 62nd Street, where our district merges with our eastern border at 14th Avenue. The Fort Hamilton area, which follows the southern shoreline, is comprised of historic Fort Hamilton, located near the magnificent span of the Verrazzano Bridge and overlooking New York Harbor. Community District Ten is 77% residential, 16% park land, 3% manufacturing, and almost 2% commercial.  Land in the District is mostly taken up by these five categories - one- and two-family homes (33.3%), open spaces/outdoor recreation (29.94%), public facilities/institutions (14.11%), multifamily walk-ups (9.04%), and mixed residential and commercial area (5.04%).  Community District Ten has 352.51 acres of parkland spread across 17 parks.  Parks within the District provide a multitude of diversified athletic and passive recreational facilities to residents and visitors throughout the year.  The decennial census and the American Community Survey (ACS) are the primary resources for demographic data.  2020 Decennial Census - Population Growth  The 2020 decennial census reports an increase in population in 2020 for Community District Ten at 136,071 compared to 124,491 in 2010.  The NYC Department of Health's Community Health Profile report lists Community District Ten's population in 2022 as 144,859.  Both reflect increases over the decade at 9.3% and 12 % respectively. The Department of Health's Community Health Profile reports the following: 60% of the population is white non-Hispanic, 24% is Asian, 13% is Latino (+ 30%), 1% is Black, and the remaining 2% identifies as ""Other.""  The profile also reports age group demographics: 20% of the population is 17 years and under, 6% of the population is 18-24 years old, 32% of the population is 25-44 years old, 25% of the population is 45-64 years old, and the remaining 17% are ages 65 and up.  Planning for Population Growth - Youth - School Utilization Data  This growth in population may impact the over-capacity schools within Community District Ten.  There are currently 16 public schools serving students in K through 12th grade located within the boundaries of Community District Ten.  Community District Ten is wholly located within Community School District 20 which is listed as the most overcrowded school district in the City of New York according to the Department of Education's latest Enrollment and Capacity Utilization report which can be found online at https://data.cccnewyork.org/data/map/76/school-utilization-and-overcrowding#76/243/5/118/62/a/a.  Community Board Ten's Youth Services, Education and Libraries Committee will be meeting with the School Construction Authority to discuss media reports of citywide enrollment declines and the impact to school utilization in Community District Ten.  There are five new schools currently under construction by the New York City School Construction Authority.  The first, is a 592 seat Middle School located at 650 86th Street.  The second, is a 322 seat Pre-K through 5th grade school that will be located at 6740 3 Avenue.  The third, is a 676-seat primary school to be located at 6301 12th Avenue.  The fourth is 8802 5th Avenue, a 572-seat primary school. The fifth is 425-439 Ovington Avenue and 441-447 Ovington Avenue, a 676-seat high school.  Senior Population    Community District Ten is also comprised of 16.6% individuals over the age of 65. The Profile of Older New Yorkers authored by the New York City Department for the Aging (DFTA) is a comprehensive resource of information by Community District, borough, and citywide levels.  Community District Ten ranks third in the Borough of Brooklyn with 22.7% of its total population over the age of 60.  Community Board Ten continues to advocate for senior needs and is a proud member of the Bay Ridge Age Friendly Committee.  The Bay Ridge Center for Older Adults and the Brooklyn Chinese American Association were recently awarded senior center contracts by the New York City Department for the Aging.  The new centers promise to serve seniors within Community District Ten.  The Bay Ridge Center currently provides 650 home delivered meals to seniors in need.  Serving over 2,000 seniors, the Bay Ridge Center's church basement location was not adequate. Their new state-of-the-art senior center facility is located at 15 Bay Ridge Avenue. The Brooklyn Chinese American Association recently opened their new senior center located at 7207 8th Avenue.   With the senior population growing within Community District Ten, non-residential senior centers that offer practical resources are also expanding citywide.  Here in Bay Ridge, our Naturally Occurring Retirement Community has also received additional storefront services at Bay Ridge Connects.  The services provided help seniors remain independent, living in their homes as long as possible. Bay Ridge Connects is located at 7609 3rd Avenue. Bay Ridge Connects receives funds from the Department for the Aging targeted toward ""naturally occurring retirement communities"".   FY 2025 Public Hearing Civic Engagement/Public Feedback  Extensive public outreach was conducted in preparation of the FY 2025 District Needs Statement, Capital, and Expense Priorities.  Feedback included parent advocacy for additional school crossing guards.  The NYPD reports school crossing guard vacancies in Patrol Borough Brooklyn South at 33 and Patrol Borough Brooklyn North at 19. The 68th Precinct is provided an allotment of 32 and there were 2 vacancies in FY 2024 and an additional 10 school crossing guards are needed to be assigned to the 68th Precinct to cover new school locations.   There was a proposed AIRS project at 9000 Shore Road. However, residents of 9000 Shore Road and surrounding area have had issues with raw unsanitary sewage backups that began over a decade ago and worsened over the last few years. They believe that any new large scale deveopment will negatively impact the already stressed aging infrastrucutre and argued that there is a severe problem with current conveyance that must be studied and repaired. City Council Member Justin Brannan met with officials from Department of Envrionmental Protection to share neighbor concerns about the potential devastating impact impct to the nearby fragile sewer system. Council Member Brannan requested a full study of the sewage flow in this catchment area, a ""Flows and Loads Study"" from Regulator 9A to this catchment area to the Owls Head Wastewater Recovery Resource Facility, Vibrations Analysis, Dry Weather Study, Capacity Study, and an inspection of all nearby branch interceptors and sewers in the immediate area, to which DEP requested a list of affected locations be provided for their review. In response, Community Board 10 emailed and sent out a USPS mailing to homes surrounding the proposed AIRS development in parking lot of 9000 Shore Road, the parameters of the information request were 86th Street to 94th Street and from Shore Road to 3rd Avenue. The District Office received 85 responses to our survey, to which 78 were within the parameters indicated above. Comments included strong sewer odors in large nearby apartment buildings and along local streets. In addition, Community Board 10 also received separate surey results from an additional 40 co-op owners of 9201 and 9101 Shore Road indicating recurring sewer odors into their buildings and along Shore Road and many of the nearby sewers and catch basins particularly along 92nd Street.   Land Use and Resiliency planning for our future  Community Boards Citywide are preparing to review several citywide text amendments in the upcoming Fiscal Year.  Dubbed the City of Yes, Zoning for a more equitable and sustainable city includes plans to modernize and update zoning regulations to support small businesses, create affordable housing and promote sustainability.  Community Board Ten will be taking a close look at all of the proposals and provide opportunities for businesses, residents, and homeowners to submit feedback.   Concerns continue the elimination of greenspaces/front yards in violation of Streetscape Text Amendment (thereby reducing ability to capture rainwater creating more pressure on our century-old combined sewer infrastructure), preservation of historical properties/corridors, and increased vacancy rates within our manufacturing and C8 Commercial District.  Future Development in Community District 10  The rezoning of Community District Ten to contextual districts in 2005 and 2007  allowed for as-of-right growth.  A few years ago, the Zoning and Land Use Committee was tasked with reviewing as of right development potential throughout the District and worked with a fellow from the Fund for the City of New York to examine soft sites in Community District Ten.  Mr. Jack Storey analyzed soft sites and his research was published in a report presented to Community Board Ten's Zoning and Land Use Committee.  The report noted that most Community District Ten residents are renters, as 61 percent of the district's housing units are in multi-family structures.  87.6% of Community District 10 housing units were built before 1970.  There are 1,062 parcels with at least 50% development potential and 71 sites with high development potential in higher density zones.  This analysis pointed out two areas for future development including the area around the 86th Street C8 triangle and the 65th Street corridor.  The 65th Street corridor was studied in 2020-2021 and the C8 triangle will be reviewed by a future planning fellow with the Fund for the City of NY fellowship program.  There are 52,460 total households in Brooklyn Community District 10 with 60.1% being family households and 39.9% being nonfamily households. In Community District 10, there are a total of 55,768 housing units with 94.1% of them being occupied. 5.9% of them are vacant - 1.8% of them are up for rent.   Small Businesses - Post covid economy  Post pandemic, our commercial businesses are in recovery.  Our commercial overlay corridors are home to variety of retail establishments, most notably eating and drinking establishments, service providers and small mom and pop grocery stores. The pre-pandemic commercial vacancy rate in Bay Ridge's 1142 storefronts was approximately 6 %.  The 86th Street BID reported a pre-pandemic vacancy rate of about 8 percent. The post pandemic economy remains uncertain.  Several large chain stores permanently shuttered including Century 21 Department Stores, Jennifer Convertibles, TJ Maxx, Modell's and NY and Company leaving a large retail void and an opportunity for future development. The short-term economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic within Community District 10 are significant and it remains too soon to project future financial implications to the local economy.  The visible impact of empty storefronts on the commercial corridors especially along the 86th Street Business Improvement District are disconcerting to the public. The 5th Avenue and 86th Street BIDs are working together to help many of our small businesses adapt to digital forums and provide advice on marketing strategies.  The 5th Avenue BID was awarded an Avenue NYC Commercial Revitalization Grant which included a Commercial District Needs Assessment (CDNA).  Although all data pertaining to the CDNA was compiled prior to the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, its data will be helpful to assist local businesses during the economic recovery. The CDNA within Community District 10 included an analysis of the storefront and retail mix, door to door merchant surveys, consumer and shopper surveys, and an in-depth inventory of streetscape conditions that affect the local retail experience.  The CDNA report is a must read.  Its key findings and opportunities stress the vast business opportunities within CD10.  Its strengths include the neighborhood's diversity and cultural assets to market the district to residents, visitors and entrepreneurs, abundant dining options, wide array of transit options, small town feeling as well as an active and growing arts community.  The challenges include minimal online presence as many businesses are unfamiliar with digital marketing tools, changing consumer demographics and tastes, improper disposal, and unsatisfactory trash management, as well as road congestion, vehicle speeds and insufficient parking which can turn away shoppers who travel by private vehicle.   Youth Needs  Community Board Ten participated in DYCD's Summer Youth Employment Program. As we remain the most over utilized school district in the city, the need for after school programming and affordable day care options are also a top priority and concern.     Community Boards  Community Boards provide residents a forum, an opportunity to be engaged in city government.  Whether providing input on local issues or contributing comments regarding land use planning proposals or liquor licenses, Community Boards are critical to providing citizens a voice. Funding to assist growing demands placed on Community Boards is a top priority. Changes in technology is one important area requiring expanded funding as Community Boards citywide have only one OTI (Office of Technology Information) citywide staff member to assist the Boards with technology assistance.   Pressing Issues  Our communities need to be more resilient and sustainable, and be prepared for more frequent stronger storms, sea-level rise and changing climates. We also need to plan for growth and development while balancing the impacts to our environment. ","","","","","Infrastructure resiliency","","All agencies within New York City government must strive to be more resilient and sustainable, and be prepared for more frequent stronger storms, sea-level rise and changing climates. We also need to balance environmental impacts as we plan for growth and development.   At the most local level, Community Boards must focus on resiliency and advocate for funding and policies toward achieving this goal. Community Board Ten’s FY 2025 Capital and Expense Priorities/District Needs Public Hearing was held on October 16, 2023.  During the months of September and October,  Community District Ten residents responded in great numbers to share their concerns and requests for inclusion in the District Needs Statement and Capital/Expense Priority lists.  Board Members reviewed surveys from residents about the impacts caused by an aging sewer infrastructure failing to handle increased cloudburst rain events pouring greater than 1/2 inch of rain per hour.   It also listened to neighbors advocacy for increased funds for tree planting and pruning throughout the district.   At the duly publicized October 2023 General Board meeting, homeowners testified seeking continued support for the installation of larger capacity sewers along 10th Avenue from 77th Street to 86th Street within Community District 10.     During the 2022 public hearing on Community Board 10's Capital and Expense priorities,  10th Avenue homeowners and residents publicly declared an emergency sharing that raw sewage backups are now a regular occurrence during all rain events.  Some shared harrowing stories of sewage infiltration, recurring property damage and health concerns.  Community Board Ten members voted to advocate, continued support for this capital priority ranked number 1 in FY 2024 budget and Continued Support this year following a commitment of $55 million dollars in capital funding.   Additionally, Executive Committee members reviewed submissions from residents about increases in repeated sewage backups and street flooding at various locations throughout Community District 10.  All locations were ranked in the top five Capital Priorities for review by the New York City Department of Environmental Protection.  Maximizing rainwater capture must be incorporated in all future capital projects.  One nearby capital project at Patrick O'Rourke Playground located on 81st Street between 11th and 12th Avenues is a collaboration between NYC Parks and the NYC Department of Environmental Protection. It includes the reconstruction of the multi-purpose play area with full depth asphalt, new lexan backboards and hoops, and benches. It will also include the installation of underground retention tanks which will hold excess water from major storms.  The paving over of green space in front yards to create unpermitted parking pads or concrete gardens is an additional resiliency concern in Community District 10. Maximizing rainwater absorption is key to storm water management.  There is currently no permit required for homeowners to pave over their front gardens via the New York City Department of Buildings although there is clearly a Streetscape Text Amendment included in the New York City Zoning Resolution.  Community Board Ten will renew efforts to request a DOB permit be filed that would preserve front yard green spaces, request enforcement at locations reported that may violate the Streetscape Text Amendment and seek expansion of the current 25% front yard allowance. This will certainly aid in rainwater absorption and lessen burden on storm drains and catch basins.  There is a broad citywide initiative to better manage storm water and this must be part of that effort.   The New York City Department of Environmental Protection released New York City Storm Water Flood Maps to ""help New Yorkers understand and prepare for the increase of coastal storms, sea level rise impacts and extreme rain events that will strain our infrastructure and put New York City's homes and businesses at risk"".   The three maps demonstrate a range of flood scenarios to help New Yorkers understand how stormwater flood patterns change over time.   Community Board 10 is also home to the Owls Head Wastewater Resource and Recovery Facility located at 6900 Shore Road adjacent to Upper New York Bay.  The Owls Head WWRR Facility opened in May of 1950 and is one of fourteen water/sewage treatment facilities citywide.  The population growth to processing loads of this important facility .  The plant currently serves over 800,000 residents across 5 Community Districts in western Brooklyn.  Owls Head Wastewater Treatment facility was severely impacted during Sandy and several capital projects are underway to protect this asset critical to treatment process to comply with New York State DEC Consent Order compliance standards to protect the waterways by restricting discharges of untreated domestic sewage combined with stormwater.     ","Parks and open space","","PARKS  -  With 16% of its land dedicated to parks, Community Board Ten prioritizes the maintenance of its parkland in both its Capital and Expense priorities each year. Community Board Ten is home to the following parks: Shore Road Park, Dyker Beach Park, John J. Carty Park, Russel Pederson Park, Owls Head Park, McKinley Park, Leif Ericson Park, and John Paul Jones Park.  Many of Community Board Ten’s parks need refurbishment and renovation.  While there are several city council and mayoral funded parks capital projects currently in the design/construction phase, many necessary projects remain unfunded including projects related to interior and exterior deteriorated or crumbling pathways.  This includes the Shore Road Promenade bicycle path and pedestrian walkway. Issues related to parks include, but are not limited to, lack of tree pruning and maintenance, lack of parks personnel, and outdated, worn play equipment.  There are 24 capital budget priorities specific to Parks that were identified within Community Board Ten.  This year, Community Board Ten surveyed its Parks Comfort Stations following community requests describing poor conditions and maintenance issues.  There are five restroom  station priorities within the FY 2025 list, in addition to McKinley Park which has been on our list for a number of years. The restroom/comfort station requests include the Shore Road Park at 101 Street, Shore Road Park at 79 Street, John Jay Carty Park, Millennium Playground at Leif Ericson Park, and Dyker Beach Park at Bay 8th Street.   In September 2023,  CB10 Parks Committee invited NYC Parks Department officials to discuss Parks needs in the district.  At this meeting, members listened to updates for upcoming capital improvement projects and discussed both capital and expense needs.  The dialogue revealed a great need for substantial capital investments to repair and refurbish aging equipment, infrastructure and facilities.  Routine maintenance needs were highlighted by local park volunteers in attendance.  Maintenance requests are often delayed due to insufficient personnel or equipment failure. There are zero gardeners assigned to parks in Community District Ten.  Service requests from 311 via NYC Open Data show an increase in requests related to tree pruning, dead trees and deterioration of conditions around park paths.  Also, service requests about playgrounds stress the need for additional grounds crews and equipment to maintain our beautiful parks.  It was also noted by local park volunteers and Board Members that great capital investments made to refurbish local playgrounds must include ongoing maintenance funds.   Forestry complaints continue to rank among the highest 311 service delivery calls in the district.  Tree pruning request calls to 311 for overgrown or dead branches in 2022 year to date total 250, compared to a total of 411 in 2021 and 388 in 2020.  There were 403 trees removed during Calendar Year 2022 versus 151 in 2021.  There were 279 trees pruned in 2022 versus 1447 in 2021 and 97 trees planted in 2022 compared to 151 in 2021.   Residents are also frustrated by the increase in response time to forestry service requests.   There is currently a three year or longer wait for new street trees and 334 forestry service requests pending for greater than 6 months.   All of NYC Parks current tree maintenance is based on risk management assessment and work is prioritized based on the likelihood of tree failure, impact, and consequences of impact. For example, a mid-size tree branch that is hanging from a tree that is deemed by a forester upon inspection as not likely to cause significant damage will generate a work order that may take up to 180 days to complete. Community District Ten residents are frustrated by the duration of time it takes for tree service requests to be completed.   Rat complaints in three local parks continues to be a concern for area residents including Shore Road Park, Owls Head Park and Dyker Beach Park.   ","Quality of life issues (noise, graffiti, petty crime, etc.)","","Quality of Life Issues are currently one of the three most pressing topics within Community District Ten due to several factors.  Police and Public Safety Issues: Although the 68 Precinct remains among the safest precincts in New York City, many have voiced concern over quality-of-life issues.    A review of data reveals that the 68th Precinct Compstat reports non-index crimes rose sharply in some categories over the last two years.  Petit Larceny is up 49 percent within this two year analysis.   The results of this can be felt by small mom and pop stores along our commercial overlay corridors.  Many retail pharmaceutical store chains now place toiletries and other consumer goods under locked shelving units, adding to consumer concerns about quality of life. , Grand Larceny 18.3 percent; G.L.A. up 58 percent.  Reports of citywide subway crimes on the rise in the media and up 60 percent in the two year period reported on CompStat.  Residents concerned about local catalytic converter theft from passenger vehicles, car vandalism, porch package thefts, and post office white washing of checks mailed at district post office stations have certainly created widespread concern about quality-of-life issues locally and citywide.   Noise and Illegal Parking – Top 311 Service Requests in Community District Ten.  Illegal Parking and Noise were both top 311 Service Requests in Community District Ten.  Illegal Parking remains the number one service request with 10,700 calls in FY 2023 vs. 4,100 in FY 2022.  Noise at 2,700 service requests in FY 2023 versus 1,500 in FY 2022.   Specifically problematic is the overnight parking and storage of commercial vehicles and trucks – some 53 foot in length around the perimeter of Dyker Beach Golf Course.  Neighbors regularly call for enforcement which is not sufficient to handle this matter due to limited tow resources, tow storage facilities and enforcement agents to summons.  NYPD has conducted several tow operations and the problem continues.  This also creates an environment conducive to illegal trash dumping and many feel unsafe walking around the perimeter due to obstructions created by the large trucks.  Senior Quality of Life – Walkable Sidewalks:  A Community Conversation Seniors 65+ in Bay Ridge/Dyker Heights/Fort Hamilton comprise 15 percent of the district’s population.  The rate of fall related hospitalizations is higher than citywide average. (NYC Dept Health Profiles) The New York Academy of Medicine predicts this demography of 65+ will grow in the next decade. As senior centers throughout the district resumed in person services, many voiced concerns about how to address participant concerns regarding safe, accessible, and walkable sidewalk corridors in our communities.   The increase in motorized mopeds and scooters riding on the sidewalks was touted as a top quality of life issue impacting local seniors. A Bay Ridge Center Fellow worked with Community Board 10 to identify senior safety needs by conducting several virtual and in person surveys.  In response, this past year the Bay Ridge Age Friendly Committee hosted an in-person and livestreamed forum – Walkable Sidewalks:  A Community Conversation. The Age Friendly Committee is working with agencies, community groups, etc. to improve sidewalk safety through conversation, collaboration and advocacy and to listen to concerns and suggestions from all.  Walkable sidewalk challenges raised by seniors also include, broken, uneven pavement, blocked pedestrian ramps, cars parking and driving on sidewalks, expanded use of business on sidewalk, stoop line general vending infractions, as well as outdoor dining structures.  Smoke Shops and Failings in the Regulation of Legalized Recreational Cannabis:  In summer of 2023, there remains more than 25 unlicensed smoke shops opened in anticipation of the legalization of recreational marijuana.  Many community residents have voiced concerns that unlicensed shops geared at sales to young people must be addressed.  Currently, there is inadequate enforcement effort to handle unlicensed cannabis product sales.  Additionally, many smoke shops sell unlicensed tobacco and CBD products.  CB10 will focus on the quality of life, public safety and health concerns posed by this recent activity.  The NYC Smoke Free Air Act was adopted to protect all from harmful effects of second-hand smoking.  The sudden proliferation of unlicensed smoke shops are advertising to adolescents and underage students.  Spike in Rat Complaints District Wide: The quality of life concerns raised in 2022 due to an explosion in rat sighting complaints. Rat Sightings in CB10 post pandemic are astounding.  There were 117 rat sighting 311 service complaints made in 2019 which is up to 350 year to date in 2022.  Rat sightings in NYC Parks reported to 311 in 2019 amount to 17 services requests as compared to 71 reported year to date in 2022.     ","","","","","Programs, services or facilities for seniors (incl. remote programming, cooling centers)","","Community Board Ten’s population is comprised of 16.8% individuals over the age of 65. Members of Community Board Ten continue to advocate for community based funding for necessary services to help our senior population age in place. Programs such as Meals on Wheels and the Supplementary Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) are needed to accommodate the District’s growing senior population   There are currently four senior centers within Community Board Ten  - Bay Ridge Center for Older Adults, Brooklyn Chinese American Association Senior Center, Shore Hill Neighborhood Center and Fort Hamilton Senior Recreation Center. The Bay Ridge Center is one of two Meals on Wheels service providers servicing Community Board Ten.  The Bay Ridge Center serves 650 home delivered meals daily. The number of seniors residing in the Dyker Heights section of the district is also growing.  Many attend senior centers in neighboring communities.    Some of the lessons learned post pandemic include the need for expanded technology services to assist seniors with new virtual platforms.  Many of our seniors do not have wi-fi or desk top computers which have been most helpful in participating in digital platforms.  The Bay Ridge Center has created a loan and training program on tablets and is expanding its outreach via its Bay Ridge Connects storefront office.  Many local seniors now enjoy hybrid and remote programming options.  ","There are two full service hospitals within a mile of Community District 10 boundaries.  They include Maimonides Health and NYU Langone Hospital. Both hospitals serve the needs of CD10 residents. Both hospital administrations work proactively to provide community outreach to educate and share information about healthcare and preventative services.   In addition, the Brooklyn Campus of the Veterans Affairs NY Harbor Healthcare System, run by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs is located within Community District 10 at 800 Poly Place.  This location serves veterans from within and beyond Community District 10. Healthcare is important to all but notably to our aging senior population. The most recent New York City Department of Health Profile 2022 reports there has been a notable increase in the number of fall related hospitalizations in older adults.  There were 1876  in Bay Ridge and Dyker Heights as compared to 1526 per 100,000 Borough-wide and higher than the citywide average for New York City.  Avoidable hospitalizations among adults in Bay Ridge/Dyker Heights were 734 as compared to all of Brooklyn where there were 1,280.  The adult smoking rate in Community District 10 is higher tthan the Brooklyn average.  There are now more than 25 unlicensed smoke shops operating in Community District 10.  The overdose death rate in the Bay Ridge-Dyker Heights area is between 15.0 and 19.9 per 100,000. Continued support is needed for opioid awareness, education and related services. Community Board Ten advocates for Narcan training for the general public.  Narcan is a lifesaving drug that can reverse the effects of an opioid overdose if administered in time.  Board Members recently held a Narcan training sponsored by Maimonides Health and distributed NYC Health Narcan kits.   In addition, During the summer of 2023,  Maimonides Health opened a much-needed new Emergency Room.  Hopefully, this new facility will address emergency room overcrowding currently experienced at our two nearby hospitals. ","Seniors are a very diversified group. The following outlines seniors within four distinct categories including: 1. Newly retired seniors who are active and still working and/or volunteering. 2. The established and healthy older person who is fully enjoying retirement and interested in leisure activities. 3. The ""aging in place"" elder in need of care service and support to remain independent. 4. The home bound and impaired elderly individual in need of daily home and personal care services. Community Board Ten recognizes the diverse needs of the elderly population which spans several subgroups. The Bay Ridge Age Friendly Committee and the Bay Ridge Center provide services to these four main senior groups in Community Board Ten. Shore Hill Senior Group, Fort Hamilton Senior Center and many friendship groups serve the needs of local seniors.  The Bay Ridge Age Friendly Committee continues to meet regularly to identify initiatives for seniors and consider how best to serve and benefit the growing senior population of Bay Ridge.   Community Board Ten is working alongside the Bay Ridge Center and local business leaders to assist with the expansion of Age Friendly NYC goals by reaching out to city government agencies involved in the Age Friendly effort. The Brooklyn Chinese American Association also opened a full service Senior Center to serve the growing senior population in Dyker Heights section of the District.  At the District Office of Community Board Ten, residents continue to request and advocate for the development of affordable senior housing in the District.  Many seniors are displaced when unregulated buildings they have lived in for decades are sold and unable to find affordable rents in their community.  Community Board Ten's Senior Issues and Housing, Health and Welfare Committee will continue to work with local senior based service providers.  We are pleased that two local organizations were awarded contracts for State of the Art Senior Centers.  The Bay Ridge Center for Older Adults will open its new center at 15 Bay Ridge Avenue on November 1, 2023 and the Brooklyn Chinese American Assocation opened its new center the summer of 2023 at 7201 8th Avenue.

In fact, Community District Ten's Top 10 Complaint Types in FY 2022 saw Noise service requests rank number 4 with 1,500 service requests. In FY 2023 this number increased to 2,700 service requests filed.  Loud Music/Party descriptor remained most complained about followed by Banging/Pounding/ Loud Talking.    A top public nuisance reported is loud mufflers from autos creating disturbances and public safety concerns. Recent state legislation to institute steep penalties was adopted to address this issue.   Illegal Parking is the top community service request in Community District 10.  Overnight truck, trailer and commercial parking and storage around the perimeter of Dyker Beach Golf Course, Bay Ridge Parkway at 7th Avenue, Erik Place, Wakeman Place at 7th Avenue as well as 7th Avenue northbound from Bay Ridge Parkway to 65th Street. ","The 68th Police Precinct is coterminous with Community Board Ten.  The crime statistics provided to the public as part of CompStat indicate an analysis of index and non-index crimes.  Year to date in a one year review (Year to date CY 2021 vs. 2022)  Index Crime report is as follows:  Murder 2 in 2022 and 0 in 2021; Rape 12 in 2021 and 10 in 2022; Robbery is 45 in 2022 and 44 in 2021; Felony Assault is 75 in 2021 and 92 in 2022; Burglary is down 102 in 2021 and 87 in 2022; Grand Larceny is up with 307 in 2021 and 424 in 2022; and G.L.

School Crossing Guard Vacancy in Community Board Ten currently stands at a deficit of 2 crossing guards with a reduced allotment of 32 assigned to 68 Precinct.  This is a concern locally as five new schools are underway and Community Board 10 members are seeking an increase to an allotment of 40 school crossing guards.  ","FDNY Battalions 40 and 42 Service Community District 10.  Community Board Ten reviewed data provided during budget consultations, FDNY District Resource Statements and other communication on fire activity within the district.     Community Board 10 Members support the need to maintain firefighting personnel strength. In additin,  FDNY- EMS staffing levels must be maintained.  During the Covid-19 pandemic the importance of EMS workers was evidenced in the large increase in calls to transport patients who fell ill to this disease.    It is imperative that staffing levels be maintained and is supported by Community District 10 and ranked withing the top ten of its expense priorities. ","","","","","Sewer capacity","","Residents in several portions of Community District 10 are concerned about the combined sewer conveyance systems and frequent sewer backups in heavy rain and during dry weather events.  These areas include, 10th Avenue from 77th Street to 86th Street. Last year, 40 residents submitted testimony seeking design for new sewers with greater capacity due to street flooding during severe rain events along 10th Avenue.  The 10th Avenue location was moved to #1 position on Community Board 10's Capital Priority List and the remaining locations to the #4 and #5 positions due to the growing concern of cloudburst rain events and impact to our aging sewer infrastructure. There was a commitment of $55 million in capital funding secured in the FY 2024 budget. Community Board Ten provided a survey to residents and received 100 responses from residents along the following street segments:  Narrows Avenue and Colonial Road from Bay Ridge Parkway to 92nd Street.  In addition, neighbors experiencing recurring sewer backups include Bay Ridge Parkway from Shore Road to 3rd Avenue; 13th Avenue from Bay Ridge Avenue to 79th Street;  11th Avenue from 62 Street to 72 Street; 12th Avenue from Bay Ridge Avenue to 79th Street; and 70th Street between Shore Road and Narrows Avenue. ","Community Board 10 recognizes the need for ongoing capital funds to maintain the Owls Head Wastewater Treatment plant located at the northern end of Community District 10 at Bay Ridge Avenue and Shore Road. CB10 is home to the Owl's Head Wastewater Treatment Plant, which treats up to 120 million gallons of wastewater per day for the 758,007 New Yorkers it serves. Complaints regarding odor emanating from the Plant and upgrades to ensure odor control continue to remain a top priority need in Community District 10. Community Board Members reviewed two large capital enhancement projects in 2022 that are currently underway at the Owls Head Wastewater Treatment Plant.  OH-91 is the reconstruction of its sludge docks and OH-92 is the construction of a new Total Residual Chlorine Reduction Facility. The Department of Environmental Protection also updated Board Members on its capital plan in 2022.  A proactive capital plan is also needed for upgrades to address the aged sewer and water main infrastructure in Community Board Ten. The majority of infrastructure is over 100 years old and emergency upgrades are often necessary to reactively handle collapsed infrastructure.  Finally, Community Board 10 identified need to study the Combined Sewer Outfall infrastructure along the Shore Road Promenade sea wall which was badly damaged during Superstorm Sandy and many coastal storms that followed.  NYC Parks included funding to make repairs to CSO outfall as part of Shore Road Promenade infrastructure capital repairs.  The need to inspect, maintain and improve CSOs is critical to the combined sewer conveyance system as well as compliance with the New York State regulations to maintain water quality in Upper New York Bay.  ","The FY 2022/23 District Resource Statement for BK10 Sanitation District provides the number of collection trucks, salt spreaders.  We are down 2 collection trucks.. from 20 assigned in FY 2022 to 18 in 2023; Same number of Salt spreaders and haulsters which are 7 and 2respectively. Community District Ten has several narrow streets that require haulster type vehicles which are smaller to navigate through tight spaces for snow removal. DSNY does allocate specialized equipment to various garages based on efficient operational planning which ensures the prompt clearing of ice/snow and sweeping of the curb lines.  As stated above, there are currently two assigned to the District. During heavy snowstorms, smaller streets often must wait for snow removal so an additional haulster may be helpful to address this need. Brooklyn 7/10 Salt Shed.   Motorized Litter Personnel (MLP) is highly important as our Community District has over 20 MLP locations in need of regular cleaning.  The percent of streets rated as acceptably clean in 96.4% which is better than the boroughwide average. City Council Member Justin Brannan allocates additional funds each Fiscal Year for additional corner basket pick ups and MLP service to supplement DSNY district funding.   The total diversion rate is 20.0% which is higher than the Borough Total of 15.8%.  Community Board Ten is actively promoting and encouraging residents to participate in the restored organics collection as part of regular recycling.    E-waste collection was suspended and many residents complain about the challenges of disposing electronics. Improper Disposal/Illegal Dumping at corner baskets is a complaint received at the District Office on a daily basis.   Corner baskets are found along the commercial overlay corridors and misuse and illegal dumping is a challenge for merchants, residents, and local Business Improvement Districts.     ","","","","","Land use and zoning","","Community Board 10 supports funding for the Department of Buildings inspectors to respond to wide array of building related concerns in the district including Work Without A Permit, Work Contrary to Zoning or Beyond Scope of Permit or illegal commercial or housing conversions which create substandard, overcrowded or even dangerous housing situations.  Recently, in New York City, 11 people were tragically killed in illegal basement apartments during Hurricane Ida. Heavy rains deluged the city’s wastewater infrastructure creating sewer backups, street flooding and water surges that trapped many in illegally converted basements with no second means of egress. While none of the deaths occurred in Community District 10, substandard housing remains a top concern.  The Department of City Planning under the Adams Administration has proposed a City of Yes initiative and includes three citywide Text Amendments.  The future changes to zoning will have impacts to every Community District including the neighborhoods of Bay Ridge, Dyker Heights and Fort Hamilton.        ","Additional staffing including inspectors is needed to address enforcement of illegal conversions of one and two family homes in Community District Ten, illegal curb cuts/car ports/front yard accessory parking spaces as well as conversions of commercial properties to non-conforming uses. ","No comments","There are two Business Improvement Districts within Community District 10. They are the 86th BID and the Bay Ridge 5th Avenue BID. The Bay Ridge 5th Avenue BID applied and was awarded a two year grant to complete a Commercial District Needs Assessment (CDNA) for the Bay Ridge section of Community District Ten.  The CDNA provides valuable data on needs of business community.  The COVID-19 pandemic greatly impacted the 86th Street corridor with the permanent closing of Century 21 Department Stores, Modell's, TJ Maxx, New York and Company and Jennifer Convertibles.  The recovery is slow but is underway.  Sephora and a newly expanded Foot Locker are two major stores opened recently.  The development of the vacant storefronts is greatly anticipated by local residents as 86th Street is vital to the District's downtown area.  ","","","","","Traffic safety and enforcement (cars, scooters, ebikes, etc.)","","Traffic safety, mass transit improvements, and roadway maintenance are all district-wide transportation priorities.       Street Safety: Over the years, Community Board 10 has worked on several pedestrian and school safety initiatives with the New York City Department of Transportation.   Speeding, drag racing, noise from cars with altered mufflers, double parking, cars parking on sidewalk, cars driving on sidewalk, motorized scooters/e-bikes riding on the sidewalk or in street not adhering to traffic rules, motorized scooters riding along pedestrian pathways at local parks are some examples of critical safety concerns raised by residents.  All users of the roadway have an expectation that those around them will abide by traffic safety regulations.  Unfortunately, all too often there are tragic consequences caused by blatant disregard of traffic rules/regulations and reckless behavior.   Traffic safety education, traffic safety enforcement, roadway improvements/redesigns are important and local elected officials continue to work on sweeping Safe Streets legislation packages to assist local communities.  The Police Department District Resource Statement reports that vehicle collisions are trending down in Community District 10.    Moving Violation enforcement by the NYPD is also imperative.     ","Community Board Ten Traffic and Transportation Committee annually reviews the condition of local roadways and reports its findings to the New York City Department of Transportation. It recently submitted a list of locations of infrastructure concerns where roadbed cave-ins and depressions reoccur. Following the elimination of the DEP Trench Restoration contract, many street beds in CD Ten need to be studied to determine if they require capital infrastructure improvements. In recent years, street resurfacing is on a yearly cycle but only thirty percent of requested roadways in Community District Ten are expected to be milled and resurfaced during an annual cycle.  Community Board Ten's Capital Priority list includes the following locations for study to determine trench restoration contract eligibility.  Rankings include:   13th  Avenue between Bay Ridge Parkway and 76 Street, 87th Street between 3rd and 4th Avenue,  12th Avenue at Bay Ridge Avenue. Sidewalks damaged by trees, and crumbling curbs are the responsibility of DOT requires a much needed capital contract. Also, there has not been a curb repair contract in decades.  This year, in response to community requests, Board Members added to its capital priority list a request for DOT to initiate a capital curb contract in Community District Ten.    ","Improving public transportation is a top priority within Community District Ten. The following R stations are located in Community Board 10:  95th Street, 86th Street, 77th Street, and Bay Ridge Avenue.  The N stations at 8th Avenue and Fort Hamilton Parkway are also located within Community District 10.    The N Train Sea Beach line stations at Fort Hamilton Parkway and 8th Avenue were refurbished from 2016 through 2019.  Capital funding for these projects included the installation of ADA accessibility.  An elevator to the southbound 8th Avenue (N) platform was scheduled to be opened in May of 2020 but was delayed.  Funding is listed in part of the MTA Board Update:  2021 Commitment & Completion Goals. CB10's Traffic and Transportation Committee hopes to review the scope of project for the 95th Street Station by the end of Fiscal Year 2023.   Bus and train ridership was significantly impacted during the pandemic. Pre-pandemic numbers are returning slowly.  There is growing demand for service to the College of Staten Island and the Staten Island Mall.  Staten Island commuters are affected by rising toll costs that has resulted in the expansion of Staten Island bus service lines. The expansion of bus stops at the intermodal connection point along 4th Avenue at 87th to 88th Streets for the S93 is under consideration by the Department of Transportation.  The intersection of 86th Street at 4th Avenue was redesigned following the installation of the ADA elevator in 2020.  The traffic redesign included reducing the southbound 4th Avenue to one lane and the northbound to one lane with a dedicated right turn lane only.   A restoration of Express Bus Service X27/28 and X37/38 was made to assist weekend commuters. Express Bus Weekend Service, specifically the X27 and X28 remains a valuable form of transportation to scores of commuters including the disabled, seniors, students, and local residents. ","","","","","Park care and maintenance","","Maintenance of parks is of paramount importance to members of Community Board 10 and a top expense priority. There are no gardeners assigned to Community District Ten.   Funds for maintenance staff for maintenance is important including rodent/rat abatement.  Rat infestation in local parks is a pressing concern.  There are many capital parks projects underway thanks to funding secured by Council Member Justin Brannan and many more remaining on our Capital Priority list.    ","Our concerns for the restoration, maintenance and preservation of our parks are emphasized each year during our annual Public Hearing for Capital and Expense priorities.  Most of Community Board 10 Capital Priorities are assigned to park restoration projects.  However, while we are fortunate to have several restoration projects funding secured by Council Member Justin Brannan; funding for many of our playgrounds and parklands have been deferred because of lack of funding. While park goers have endeavored to address the need for improvements in our parks through their efforts to organize volunteer clean-up programs and advocacy; these initiatives cannot replace the urgent need to enhance the ongoing daily maintenance service in our parks. At a recent Community Board 10 Parks Committee meeting, NYC Parks reported that there are no gardeners for Community District 10.  Newly renovated parks and playgrounds must include funding for ongoing maintenance.      In addition, support for forestry services to plant and maintain street trees remains a top priority.  ","Community Board Ten supports expanded arts programming throughout the district. Additional funding is needed whether it be at local schools, supporting community beautification mural projects or local art based initiatives.","In addition to special programs, libraries provide a myriad of educational, cultural, recreational, business, and social needs for citizens. It is therefore imperative that the Board’s library system be supported and enhanced by maintaining staffing levels, expanding computerization, and programming restoration to assure that the Brooklyn Public Library receives its fair share of citywide allocation funds","The role of Community Boards has broadened in recent years. Community Boards have greater responsibilities and serve as an essential advisory component of city government proposals, land use developments and municipal service delivery requests. Combined with their charter-mandated responsibilities, Community Boards act as a catalyst between agencies and the community. The need for technology upgrades, cablecasting and software to improve service delivery data and efficiency must be funded. CB 10 supports additional baseline funding to provide broader outreach, address technological needs, and professional planning expertise.

The boundaries are the north, south, east, west limits of 61st Street, Gravesend Bay, 26th Avenue and Avenue U. The district is 3.7 square miles, and the land use is characterized as 2% parks/open space, 90% residential, 5% Manufacturing and 3% commercial. The current housing stock consists of 71,074 housing units and is characterized by 44% one- and two-family homes, 27% multi-family walk-up homes, 7% mixed residential and commercial,5% commercial and office, and 3% multifamily elevator buildings. There are 3,838 vacant housing units.   The district includes many smaller properties that are under-developed in relation to the development rights provided by the existing zoning and there has been a trend for such properties to be fully developed.   According to the most recent data derived from the 2020 decennial census, in the last decade the community's population has grown by 20,000 residents. There was significant population gain of 10% to 14.9% within the Bath Beach Neighborhood Tabulation Area, and 5% to 9.9% in the Bensonhurst Neighborhood Tabulation Area.  The community will continue to grow with both as-of-right and discretionary development.  There are currently multiple projects that will create about 1100 residential units.  This excludes the smaller dwelling units that were authorized by new residential building permits issued in 2022.  Updated socioeconomic data is not yet available. However, cited by the New York State Controller, between 2009 and 2017, there was a 62% job growth increase in Bath Beach and Bensonhurst and we are home to a high percentage of frontline workers, with 25% of workers employed in educational services, health care and social assistance.  Prior to the pandemic, Community Board 11 was well served commercially, as is all southern Brooklyn by 86th Street. This commercial shopping street running from 14th Avenue to 26th Avenue, was extremely viable. There were few vacancies and rents are high. Additional strong commercial strips serving the district are 18th Avenue, Bay Parkway, Kings Highway, Avenue U and Bath Avenue.  With expanded areas of the community included in the Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps, mitigation and resiliency projects are necessary. Storm water and sewer infrastructure upgrades, increased permeability, legislative action to enforce illegal parking pads and curb cuts and the Streetscape Text Amendment, as well as the reduction of combined sewer overflow events are a priority for this community. There is a need for coastal protection along the Shore Parkway promenade from Bay Parkway to Bay 8th Street, to protect the Belt Parkway and upland from wave action, tidal protection, and stormwater flooding. The Capital and Expense priorities submitted for Fiscal Year 2024 were carefully targeted to meet the needs of the entire community. Planning for Fiscal Year 2025 will continue the board's efforts to obtain adequate governmental assistance for all of Community Board 11.  ","","","","","Infrastructure resiliency","","In the past 11 years we have experienced more frequent severe weather events; whether coastal storms, snowstorms, microbursts, or heat waves; we need to prepare to be a physically, socially, resilient, and sustainable community.  Particular attention needs to be made not only to coastal impacts from wave action and sea level rise but also the management and diversion of storm water from entering the sewer system and reducing the amount of combined sewer overflow events.  The NYC Stormwater Flood Model illustrates that both moderate and severe stormwater flooding is located within Environmental Justice areas within the district.       The most recent storm of September 29, 2023,  caused extreme flooding in areas that were forecasted in the Stormwater maps for extreme stormwater floods with 2080 sea level rise.    There is a need for drainage studies in these areas of the district to identify potential infrastructure upgrades to prevent property damage to both residential and commercial properties.  Additionally, investments in our sewer system must be prioritized to address flooding, sewer odors and combined sewer overflows.  ","Land use trends","","Over the past few years, Community Board 11 has seen an increase in the amount of as of right development, and recently, an increase in discretionary zoning applications to facilitate development.  In addition to small development projects and pending zoning map amendments, collectively, these projects will add 1169 new residential units.    Separately, these projects do not meet the threshold for an environmental assessment statement, which would include traffic and infrastructure drainage studies.  Our district includes many smaller properties that are under-developed in relation to the development rights provided by the existing zoning and there has been a trend for such properties to be fully developed.  It is imperative that a study is initiated to determine collective development analysis and projections, which would assist Community Board 11 in advocating for appropriate levels of service and staffing for Police, Sanitation, Transportation and Parks services.  Additionally, reviews of schools for the adequacy of school seat capacity and utilization, needs for childcare slots, for senior center services, and wastewater capacity should be reviewed to determine the ability to support added growth.   This community will not be sustainable without addressing the need for additional services and infrastructure investments.  There are concerns regarding community impacts relating to the recently announced proposed text amendments to the Zoning Resolution, particularly removal of parking minimums.    Community Board 11 has seen an increase in the removal of front yard parking contrary to the Streetscape text amendment.   Our tree cover canopy is between 10 and 15%, and our Heat Vulnerability Index is  4.  The district is prone to coastal flooding, sea level rise, and stormwater flooding, as well as combined sewer overflows with 1.1 MGY discharged from OH-15 into Gravesend Bay.    A review should be conducted to strengthen existing laws and regulations and increase compliance, in order to prevent unintended consequences with the proposed removal of parking minimums.     ","Quality of life issues (noise, graffiti, petty crime, etc.)","","Prior to the pandemic hitting our city, with the increase in population, we also saw an increase in quality of life complaints, which include street cleanliness, unlicensed vending, graffiti, rodents, garbage and litter on our commercial corridors.  Department of Buildings: Illegal building conversions, illegal curb cut/carport complaints, the removal of green space in front yards for parking, and the lack of parking continue to be one of the top complaints the board receives. The Department of Buildings needs additional allocations and legislative tools to address these complaints and ensure the safety of our first responders and residents.   Police Department:  According to BetaNYC's BoardStat, the most requested 311 complaint filed within Community Board 11 relates to illegal parking,  blocked fire hydrants and blocked driveways.  The 62nd Precinct, in fiscal year 2023 received 15,400 illegal parking complaints, which includes blocked hydrants and driveways.    Illegal Parking is the top non-emergency complaint filed via 311 received by the 62nd Precinct.   We expect this trend to continue in fiscal year 2024.   ","","","","","Services for low-income and vulnerable New Yorkers","","With 16% of the district aged 65 and older and 50% of households severely rent burdened,  it is vital that adequate assistance is given to the board through programs administered by the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, particularly Article 8A loans and increased community development funding for housing programs.       Covid-19 has exposed the food and hunger needs in the community.   Both the food pantry and pop-up food distribution sites have long lines spanning blocks, with residents seeking help in accessing food.  There is a need for additional resources and funding to address the community's food needs.  Additionally, 12.6 -15% of the population is food insecure and the district has high unhealthy food access with 15-19 bodegas per supermarket.  ","","Increased funding for Senior Services    There is a need to provide increased services to our older residents, which have been diminished by budgetary constraints.  According to the Department of City Planning our older population  in New York City will increase by 40 percent to more than 1.4 million people between now and 2040.      Support services should be increased to reflect this growing, vulnerable population.","No comments","No comments","","","","","Youth workforce development and summer youth employment","","""Community Board 11 supports a variety of programs for youth including community based counselling, recreational, tutoring and cultural programs.  However, the existing needs in our community far exceed the services available.  Additional needs which must be addressed are free/low cost daycare programs, job opportunities for youth, affordable summer programs/day camps and special programs for immigrant youth.  Community Board 11 supports overall increased funding for youth services.  With 21% of households with children under 18 years old,   funding programs targeted to this population is crucial.  Community Board 11 will continue to partner with our community based organizations and the Neighborhood Advisory Board to advocate for these services. ""","","No comments","","","","","General crime","","According to the Furman Center, in 2022, the serious crime rate per 1,000 residents the violent crime rate was 1.6%  and 5% for property crime, which is an increase from 2021.  While we applaud, the men and women of the 62nd Precinct for the work that they do to keep our community safe, quality of life complaints remain high.   There is a need for increased manpower so that patrol services can adequately handle emergency calls and non-emergency calls for service.   Over the past several years, area residents have ongoing concern regarding the proliferation of trucks and large tractor-trailers traversing through the community, illegally driving on the Belt Parkway, and parking overnight on our residential streets. While legislation has been enacted to increase the penalties to truckers that travel off the designated truck route, additional enforcement personnel are needed to ensure compliance.","","No comments","","","","","Other - Write In (Required)","","""While all categories relating to core infrastructure and city services are high priorities for this community, issues relating to street cleanliness are the most common recurring complaints that the district office receives. Due to budget reductions in fiscal years 2022 and 2023, the Department of Sanitation reduced cleaning services, which included reduction in litter basket service funding. There was a 63% effective cut in service frequency, the elimination of Sunday or Holiday litter basket service.   While this Administration and the Council have provided unprecedented funding for cleaning initiative's  in the FY 23 budget our commercial corridors are still problematic.   Due to budgetary constraints the FY 24 budget included service reductions, which led to reductions in cleaning services.   Our commercial corridors primarily consist of attached buildings with commercial on the ground floor and residential above. There is no place for receptacle storage and corner litter baskets are misused and left overflowing, or garbage is improperly placed curbside.   Enforcement and education is needed to address these issues along our commercial corridors, as well as a review to determine if a 10AM-2PM basket truck would alleviate these conditions and reduce our rat population. "" ","Over the past fiscal years, we have seen extreme weather, from Hurricane Sandy to record setting blizzards, all of which have taken a toll on our streets and infrastructure. The board has identified roadways that are sinking, hummocked and have had numerous reoccurring cave-ins.  Our community has seen a proliferation of illegal curb cuts, as well as the removal of front yard gardens to create concrete parking pads. Many of these locations received violations from the Department of Buildings, could never be legalized and are contrary to the Streetscape Preservation zoning text. While this could be viewed as a Department of Buildings issue, we believe this is an issue of resiliency and sustainability.  Properties that have been violated for illegal curb cuts and/or parking pads should not be omitted from the Green Infrastructure Program or the Street Tree Planting Program.  Efforts should be made to coordinate with the Department of Buildings to determine legal status.  With areas of the community now located in the special flood hazard areas efforts need to be made to increase permeability, divert storm water from our sewer system and help reduce discharges from the combined sewer outfalls.  ","With increased population and development, there is a need for additional sanitation personnel and equipment, specifically in the area  of cleaning activities.  The District Office continues to receive complaints  relating to  illegal drops offs, improper disposal, illegal posting, and litter. There is a need for  motorized litter patrol to address street cleanliness, an expanded anti-litter campaign for outreach,  education and enforcement.  There is also a need for an increase in Sanitation Enforcement Agents. Currently, there are two agents enforcement agents per day assigned to Community Board 11. ","","","","","Land use and zoning","","There is a need for City Planning to conduct a comprehensive review of the district to assess the need for additional core services needed by this community.  Over the past few years, Community Board 11 has seen an increase in the amount of as of right development, and recently an increase in discretionary zoning applications to facilitate development.  In addition to small development projects and pending zoning map amendments, collectively these properties will add 1169 new residential units.   Separately, these projects do not meet the threshold for an environmental assessment statement, which would include traffic and infrastructure drainage studies.  Our district includes many smaller properties that are under-developed in relation to the development rights provided by the existing zoning and there has been a trend for such properties to be fully developed.  Such development analysis and projections would assist Community Board 11 in advocating for appropriate levels of service and staffing for Police, Sanitation, Transportation and Parks services.  Additionally, reviews of schools for the adequacy of school seat capacity and utilization, needs for childcare slots, for senior center services, and wastewater capacity should be reviewed to determine the ability to support added growth.   This community will not be sustainable without addressing the need for additional services and infrastructure investments.  ","There has been an increase in the number of illegal activities, such as non-approved construction, building alterations, illegal curb cuts, and the creation of front yard parking pads and zoning violations. Our community over the past few years has numerous complaints for illegal conversions and adult entertainment establishments. This type of building activity and use is a safety issue for the residents who reside in illegally occupied housing and for emergency responders. It is imperative to our residential community and quality of life that policy be implemented to expeditiously close adult entertainment establishments that violate the zoning resolution. With increased population, density, and plans for new development a study should be initiated to determine how much additional development can be supported by existing infrastructure. The Department of Buildings needs increased enforcement authority. Inspectors responding to building complaints are denied access and complaints are closed after two attempts. In addition, there needs to be additional authority as it relates to illegal curb cuts and parking pads. While many locations have received violations, there is no mechanism to enforce compliance. This is not just a quality of life issue it is one of sustainability. The removal of front yards and green space limits our storm water absorption. Community Board 11 supports the city making restoration of illegal curb cuts and billing the property owner, similar to the Department of Transportation's Sidewalk Program. ","Community Board 11 is home to a large population of older adults.  A portion of our district has been designated a Naturally Occurring Retirement Community (NORC).   It is vital that adequate assistance be given to the Board through programs administered by the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, particularly Article 8A loans in addition to an increase in community development funding for housing programs.","Initiate study for ferry service from the Bay Parkway Landing.    ""Gravesend - Bensonhurst New York Rising Community Reconstruction Plan (December 2014),   multi-purpose ferry service, with the  primary goal of emergency transportation during disaster events as well as year-round benefits such as commuter ferry service, economic development opportunities or recreational access to the waterfront.    During Superstorm Sandy, the Community’s transportation network was cut off by inundated roadways, flooding on the N subway line, and tree damage on the D subway line, leaving only the F subway line functioning. Nearby communities such as Red Hook in Brooklyn,the Rockaways in Queens, and Staten Island had emergency ferry service after Superstorm Sandy. Similar emergency ferry service would have increased transportation opportunities for Gravesend and Bensonhurst after the disaster to speed the Community’s recovery.    This project would analyze potential sites for multi-purpose ferry service, with the primary goal of emergency transportation during  disaster events as well as year-round benefits such as commuter ferry service, economic development opportunities, or recreational  access to the waterfront. This project could complement the Citywide Ferry Study Preliminary Report, published in 2013 by NYC EDC, which evaluated potential sites for fast ferry service. One potential location for a resilient dock is the end of Bay Parkway, where storm surge entered the Community and the adjacent seawall was damaged during Superstorm Sandy. A dock at  this location could be constructed in conjunction with a potential seawall-raising project to provide better protection to the upland areas. If feasible, this location near the Bensonhurst Park Tennis Center would also facilitate transportation of local workers after a disaster to other areas in the city.""","","","","","Other - Write In (Required)","","All transportation and mobility issues are a high priority for this community, from accessibility to traffic safety and enforcement.    A new issued which emerged during the pandemic is the increased use of unregistered mopeds traveling our streets and e-bikes using the sidewalks.    According to CoreData.nyc our community's population of residents age 65 years and older  is 16.5%, and the issue of e-bikes riding on sidewalks is the top complaint that we receive from this segment of the population.  While we recognize that this is a complicated issue, efforts must be made to enforce the existing laws.   Over the past few years, the weather has taken a toll on our streets. The Department of Transportation has recently resurfaced many streets throughout the district, however there is still a need for additional streets to be resurfaced. High priority should be given to the inclusion of streets surveyed by this Department.   Careful planning must be taken by all agencies to coordinate projects to prevent conflicts. In addition to weather related issues, many streets have had multiple street openings for utility work, which leaves our streets in patchwork condition. Many of these locations do not wear as well as the roadway and the openings deteriorate.   The segment of roadway on New Utrecht Avenue from 86th Street to 61 Street, is constructed of cement. Over the years the roadway has deteriorated due to wear and tear and utility openings. There are intersections especially in the low 70's, where asphalt has been placed to make necessary repairs. These temporary repairs, especially those located in the crosswalk, have left uneven crossings and potential trip hazards. With the installation of new 3 and 4-way stop signs and bicycle infrastructure, periodic inspections of high usage corridors should be made to ensure that thermoplastic markings are in good condition and visible.    Along many of our commercial corridors the streets have hummocked within the bus stops. Additional repairs are needed to make the street safer for all users of the roadway.  According to the State of New York City's Housing and Neighborhoods in 2019, the mean travel time to work is 47.6 minutes.  A study to determine the feasibility of initiating multi-purpose ferry service from the Bay Parkway Landing.  This service would provide year round benefits as a commuter ferry service and emergency transportation during a disaster.   ","As our capital priorities recommendations reflect there are multiple roadways that may be in need of trench restoration projects.   While funding was allocated for the first phase of restorations, additional funding is needed for additional trench restoration projects that have been identified by the Department of Transportation. ","No comments","","","","","Park care and maintenance","","Almost every park with Community Board 11 has received funding for renovations.   In recent years, Bensonhurst Park,  Seth Low Playground,  Benson Park, and Lt. Joseph Petrosino Park were completed.  Bath Beach Park  is in various stages of design and construction phases. These rehabilitation projects have significantly enhanced our community.      Bensonhurst Park including the promenade and ballfields are in need of capital improvements.  Both are in need of new equipment and surfaces.   Additional resources and budget restorations are needed to address garbage collection, litter, and general maintenance issues. With only 45% of residential units within 1/4 mile of a park, and the increase in population, our existing parks are heavily used.      There is also a need for additional operational staff members, increased park care, maintenance, and parks enforcement police.  ","Bensonhurst Park including the promenade are in need of capital improvements. Both are in need of new equipment and surfaces.  Community Board 11 supports the reconstruction and rehabilitation of the Shore Parkway Promenade from Bay 8th Street through Bay Parkway. This section of the promenade is in need of mitigation and resiliency efforts to protect the Belt Parkway, residential properties, businesses, and infrastructure from future storms. The parkway itself needs to be protected from storm surge and wave action so that first responders and military can move people and goods during an emergency.

Borough Park is known for its large enclave of Hasidic Jewish residents. Kensington is home to rapidly growing Pakistani and Bangladeshi Communities. Sunset Park, specifically 8th Avenue which borders District 12 as well as District 7, is the location of Brooklyn's Chinatown. Midwood's Ocean Parkway is the site of 4.86 miles long boulevard that connects the Coney Island Beach to Prospect Park.  Community Board 12 represents a diverse population with distinct and varied needs. Our differences require us to accommodate diverse and unique needs. There are several differences of note in the 2018 American Community Survey as compiled by the United States Census Bureau, 2019 and 2021 ACS data compiled by the NYU Furman Center and 2020 Decennial Census data.   The 2019 ACS birth rate in this district is 10.1%, which is more than twice the New York average rate of 4.7% (calculated as the percentage of women ages 15-50 who gave birth the previous year). This leads to a disproportionate number of infants, children and youth who require childcare and other youth services. Indeed, the percentage of youth under the age of 18 is 33.6% - the largest of any community district in NYC (per NYC Planning). These children, largely educated in non-public schools, are entitled to the proper delivery of city services, such as trash collection. Our residents should not be accosted by huge amounts of garbage on the streets in front of schools.  63.3% of residents in this district use English as a second language (ESL). 57% of the residents speak an Indo- European language (The NY rate of Indo-European language as the spoken language at home is 9%, The US rate is 3%). Notably, Yiddish, the language largely used by Hasidic residents, as well as the languages originating in the Indian subcontinent, are all Indo-European languages. Indeed, according to the 2013-2017 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates, Community Board 12 is the only district in NYC in which Yiddish is the most commonly spoken non-English language.  This is noteworthy because of the lack of proper accommodation for these ESL speakers. While NYC is well equipped to fully accommodate ESL speakers whose primary language is Spanish, the same is not true of ESL speakers whose primary language is Yiddish. The accommodations provided appear as though google translated, with awkward wording and syntax, which is difficult to understand. This district needs services provided in a way its residents can understand.  The district is comprised of a wealth of cultural and ethnic enclaves. The US Census data (2010), combined with OpenStreetMap data, found that 22% of the population in Kensington, a neighborhood within CB12, identify as ethnically Asian; this reflects the vibrant Pakistani, Bangladeshi and Indian communities that live in the area. The 2020 Census showed this demographic grew by 24.9% in the district. The Kensington area itself has welcomed many new families with young children.  The Chinatown of Brooklyn is located on 8th Avenue, which is the boundary between Community Board 7 and Community Board 12. This area has seen a steady evolution in its ethnic makeup to accommodate the growing cultural community within this desirous enclave; in some streets located between 8th and 9th Ave., between 75%-90% of residents identify as ethnically Asian.  Because of religious and cultural necessities unique to the diverse cultures this district encompasses, Community District 12 has become a much-desired area in which to live. All areas of our District continue to experience an influx of large families, which is contributing to the density of this District as a whole. The district suffers from traffic congestion, lack of parking, sanitation deficiencies, and infrastructure problems. The prime example is Borough Park, which continues to be the most densely populated section of the District. Religious constraints and sizable families anchor the community to this district because of the proximity to their houses of worship, availability of kosher food and schools.  Traffic is a result of the district's density. For one, the number of school buses needed to transport children to school is remarkable (rough estimates are about 300-350 buses a day). Understanding that traffic and parking are par for the course in dense cities, we propose a few changes that we have observed can alleviate some congestion in a fiscally viable manner. Due to the continued growth of the community, the district is constantly subjected to construction and infrastructure upgrades that further exacerbates the problem. And while permits by DOT are required for such work the stipulations, embedded to ensure traffic flow, are ignored many times. These illegal street closures create chaos with the inevitable extra burden on traffic. An increase in DOT HIQA oversight will ensure that construction is done as painlessly as possible. This year we anticipate even more traffic than usual with the BQE construction detouring traffic through our district.  We also request some innovative ideas should be seriously explored: some of our busiest stretches have traffic patterns that vary according to the time of day. Therefore, we request a middle lane of traffic to change directionally according to the patterns of am and pm rush hours. This remedy, which is already in use in other big cities, will accommodate the morning rush of traffic to work and school. We would also like serious consideration given to residential parking tags to ease the parking burden of the residents of the district.  Borough Park is in dire need of affordable housing to accommodate its growing population of residents who come to this district for its cultural wealth- not monetary wealth. A large portion of the population lives in poverty and cannot afford the market prices on housing. The 2018 ACS states that 60.3% of CB12 residents spend 35% or more of their income on rent- this is the largest percentage of all 59 NYC community boards. Per the Furman Center's latest available data, ""43.5% of renter households in Borough Part were severely rent burdened (spent more than 50% of household income on rent).""     Our children, comprising a large percentage of the population, are largely educated in religious private schools. Ever since Everson v Board of Education (1947), the largely held legal opinion was that all school children are entitled to essential services:  ""cutting off church schools from these services * so separate and so indisputably marked off from the religious function would make it far more difficult for the schools to operate. But such is obviously not the purpose of the First Amendment. That Amendment requires the state to be a neutral in its relations with groups of religious believers and nonbelievers; it does not require the state to be their adversary.""  *this statement was made in reference to transportation needs.  And while New York City celebrates diversity of culture and religion, the New York City Department of Sanitation does not fully service private school children, who are also fed 3 meals daily, the same way it does public school children. Private schools get serviced only twice a week, as do all residences. But, because Borough Park is home to the largest number of private schools in NYC, this creates a huge problem (some schools house between 2-4 thousand children- which is many times larger than local district schools). Garbage piles up and gets spread all over the street. This creates a smell during the summer. Sanitation workers can't fit the piles of garbage into their trucks and leave some for the next scheduled twice-weekly pickup. This creates a major decline in our quality of life. Daily trash collection for our private schools, who also serve daily meals thereby generating rapidly decaying garbage, is an absolute necessity. Community Board 12 met with Commissioner Tish who recognized the validity of this request and the impact this lack of service has on the street's cleanliness.  One of the primary complaints of residents of the district is the lack of oversight in Sanitation. Residents report masses of trash scattered in the streets left in the wake of what is supposed to be routine trash collection. The fact is many sanitation employees are lax in how they do their jobs. On the other hand, residents complain that they are ticketed for minor infractions such as candy wrappers that are blown into their sidewalk frontage after they cleaned in front of their house. Despite the institution of additional supervisors, the problem remains prevalent. We propose cameras mounted on all trucks so that supervisors can monitor and review their crew. It is high time the sanitation department provided photo evidence on every ticket. The accountability cameras will provide will lead to responsible trash collection and enforcement. This technology already exists and is used to ensure essential services are provided properly.  The Community Board 12 District is, and continues to be, a viable tax base. However, the demographic outliers present unique challenges. The purpose of the Community Board as a government agency is outlined in the NYC Charter. The delivery of services is a fundamental purpose of the board to which the board, as the most localized form of government, is uniquely qualified for. This district's makeup differs vastly from other districts in cultural, familial, and various other essential markers. This district requires different communication with government than other districts, as was highlighted during the current Coronavirus pandemic. But this challenge is not unique to the pandemic. The government should work more closely with the Community Board, which board has the intimate knowledge of the nuances of the community and how best to effectively communicate. We are from the community and work within it. We are ready, willing, and able to do whatever we can to assist NYC in its stated goal of promoting and celebrating diversity. ","","","","","Affordable Housing","","Community Board 12 is a densely populated community with large families living in the district. Community Board 12 is home to one of the largest enclaves of Jewish religious community that many members naturally migrate to.  This vibrant neighborhood is very much in demand as a center that can meet all the religious, social, and community needs unique to this community. As a result, the housing supply is low and the demand high, driving property values up and making affordable housing almost non-existent. This high price is driven by the extreme scarcity of property for sale and for rent. Buying a home is practically out of reach for most families in our district and renting for a reasonable rate is almost impossible. There is not sufficient, reliable, or useful means of public transportation so families will almost always have their own vehicles. Therefore, it is necessary that housing comes along with parking spaces to be of realistic use. Developers seeking a real estate profit in the district try to build small units without parking. This does not help the housing scarcity faced by current residents. Realistic solutions to affordable housing are crucial to this community. The solution is NOT to develop skyscrapers in already dense areas which exacerbates our first two pressing issues. The solution, rather, is finding innovative ways to address this problem, like developing underdeveloped areas that are littered with body shops, etc., or something like a project that is currently in the early stages of ULURP, which will develop above the rail line. ","Traffic","","Community Board 12 serves a vibrant, ever-expanding, diverse community. These properties contribute to extreme traffic congestion. There isn’t space for new housing so developers build-up, which leads to a bigger increase in cars than in parking space. There are an inordinate amount of school buses (both am and pm) transporting thousands of children to school competing with other traffic. Traffic is exacerbated by frequent unpermitted street closures. The result is a chaotic mess. The infrastructure can’t sustain the use and so we have potholes, sinkholes, cave-ins, ponding etc. We need studies of both the traffic and parking flow in areas throughout the district to best determine cost-effective measures to modernize the traffic patterns in order to bring the ""old"" community into the 21st century. We also need more HIQA officers in our district to enforce street closure permits.","Trash removal and cleanliness","","Community Board 12 has long been plagued with sanitation-related problems.  These problems affect the quality of life and also present a public health and safety issue. This district has many more private schools to serve the parochial school attendees. These schools produce the same per capita trash as public schools, but whereas public schools get daily trash collections, private schools do not. This means there’s rotting organic matter sitting around for days. Then there are the issues with regular and recycling collection. It is typical to get several complaints a day that trash has either not been collected at all, or that collection was incomplete. More oversight is needed over sanitation employees who don’t do their jobs. There has been an overload of cases in the past of spillage leaving the streets dirtier after collection than before.","","","","","Services for low-income and vulnerable New Yorkers","","While many social services programs available through HRA, not all are fully utilized.  This is partially because many of our residents don’t know of these programs or don’t have access to the programs that are available. In consolidating HRA centers, a great disservice has been done to the neediest residents in our district; those that may not know how to navigate the web or the city subway system. Community Board 12 is dire need of localized access to HRA personnel. Many of our residents use services from HRA such as; SNAP (food stamps), Medicaid, welfare, HEAP, and childcare vouchers.  The research shows that this district is one of the largest recipients of HRA services in the Borough. Many in our district, especially the Orthodox community, do not have access to the internet, thereby making it very difficult to make use of HRA services, like Access HRA, that are offered on the internet. Many HRA clients have to travel a long time to get to an HRA facility and then spend almost an entire day there. They sometimes need to bring their children and sometimes have to give up a day's work. Many of our residents feel that when visiting an HRA facility that there is some lack of cultural sensitivity, so we are asking HRA to send some service professionals to our office to serve our community, as they have done in the past.  ","No comments","Our Centers for Older Adults have adapted to the new generation of seniors, yet don't have the funding to do so properly. Additionaly, homebound seniors have been a concern for the Centers for Older Adults Senior Centers because of increased morbidity and mortality of isolated seniors. There has been success with seniors receiving tablets with Wi-Fi connections to enable them to participate in group activities such as exercise classes as well as interface with other people.

The influx of ebikes and mopeds that run rampant on our sidewalks and streets poses a real danger and has, in fact, hurt many people. 2. parking. Commercial vehicles park along McDonald Avenue and 20th and 21st Ave becuase they know they are unlikely to be ticketed and even less likely to be towed. IF the likelihood of an actual consequence exist, these commerical vehicles may decide it's not worth the risk. We need consistent towing operations, not only once or twice a year. 3. traffic flow. We have areas that are subject to predictable congestion during certain times of the day- the predictability should be used to have a traffic control agents on hand to keep the flow from clogging up. ","","","","","","Cleanliness/trash collection","","Community Board 12 district is in dire need of more collection services and dumping enforcement.

Also, after a rain a lot of the catch basins on the corners get clogged up and huge puddles make it impossible for pedestrians to cross the street. Cleaning and enlarging these catch basins should be a priority and done regularly to prevent combined sewer overflow.

We are a growing community with residential, commercial and amusement developments. We have a huge NORC population that has needs to be addressed, and a large immigrant community that also has special needs. The Russian immigrants are moving into the NYCHA projects and high-rise developments in Coney Island, changing the demographics and needs of the area. There has been an increase in Pakistani and Mexican immigrants moving into Brighton Beach.  Dwindling Effects of Superstorm Sandy  During our season, March to October, the residents are forced to cope with increased traffic congestion and the severely dwindling number of parking spaces. Since Superstorm Sandy there have been many challenges rebuilding the area's infrastructure. The streets are still torn up due to the rebuilding of the infrastructure and when they are being repaired, traffic delays become a problem. In 2012, the community was not prepared for Superstorm Sandy. Eleven years later, we are still not prepared for another Superstorm Sandy.  We realize that the need to protect our shoreline must be our first priority.  We need both short term and long-term goals to fix the shoreline.  Infrastructure Improvements   Since the last Community District Needs request, the EDC, DDC and Parks Dept have made some improvements to the infrastructure. Coney Island Phase 2A continues to work on West 16th Street between Hart Place and Surf Avenue and expects to finish in 2025. Triumph Construction is restoring the streets with the installation of porous pavements. This is the first-time porous pavement streets are being used in the area. Using porous pavements will mitigate the storm water overflow to decrease the flooding in many areas of our community.  We request that in the future, when the streets are torn up for construction projects, the streets will be replaced by porous pavements. We are still waiting for EDC to begin to rebuild the bulkhead on Coney Island Creek from Cropsey Avenue to West 22nd Street. The Parks Dept has continued to protect the shoreline by planting sea grass along Coney Island beach and Coney Island Creek Park. We hope they will continue this for the next few years to help with the entire shoreline. The long-term solution is that we need the Army Corps of Engineers, the Federal government and ORR to fund the projects necessary to protect us if another disaster occurs with the installation of sea wall/flood gates. We found out that there is $52 billion dollars allocated to the NYC area from the federal government to study and protect the shoreline. We need to fight for funding to come into the area.  Senior Population Assistance  According to City Planning, our Community District Profile indicates that we have the largest senior population in NYC with 23.9% of the Community Board #13 being seniors. The issues caused by the ever-growing senior population must be addressed including more senior housing, additional senior centers and the need for additional health care facilities, specifically geared to the senior population. The NORC population has more time on their hands and work experiences, we need to tap into this resource and expand on any intergenerational programs and mentorship with the seniors.  Needs in our Seven-Policy Area  Our most important needs in our seven policy area are: (1) Health: C1 Trauma Center needed in South Brooklyn Health; (2) Youth: Recreational/Educational Center needed for the youth and seniors; (3) Public Safety: more uniformed officers needed in the area; (4) Environmental: protecting the shoreline from the next disaster; (5) Housing/Economic Development: Overdeveloping the area with too many apartments, and need for more jobs; (6) Transportation: we need a traffic survey for the area during the summer time and improved mass transit; and (7) Parks: the permanent repair of the boardwalk. We will discuss this more in detail in each section.  ESOL Services and Immigration Rights  With the growing immigrant population in Community Board #13, we need to address ESOL services, immigration rights, etc.  Community Board #13 has been working with city and local agencies and the Brooklyn Public library to bring attention to the issues in the immigrant communities. According to the NYC Planning Community District Profiles, we are in the top three in Limited English Proficiency. To combat this, we need more ESOL and conversation classes so that our residents can become more proficient in the English language.   Issues with New Area Developments  Currently, we have several new developments being built in the area. Six development sites, each bringing in between 200-500 units per development, will surely overtax the infrastructure with more cars, causing increased congestion and parking problems. More units mean more children and seniors coming into the area. The existing schools and senior centers cannot handle the new population. These needs must be addressed before they move in. Upgrading the infrastructure includes the sewer lines that are needed to be able to handle the new developments. Six developments (West 33rd Street apartment, and Rybak/Seabreeze Apartments, Ocean Dreams and Surf Vets Apartments, Raven Hall Apartments, L&M Project) have opened in 2021/2022. There are four more large apartment developments that will be opening in the next year.   Flood Insurance Rates Increase  We are also concerned about the increase in the flood insurance rates. We know it will increase dramatically and will affect the small homeowners, renters and businesses in the area. We are disappointed with GOSR (Governor's Office of Storm Recovery) who has implemented the back flow prevention project for homeowners to have installed said preventors to prevent water from coming into the homes through the sewer lines. The program began during the pandemic and there wasn't a great response because people didn't want people in their homes. There were only two homeowners that were income qualified for the project in our district. The remaining homeowners are still without a back flow preventor and are prone to flood in the next big storm. The FEMA released preliminary flood insurance rate maps for the area.   In addition, the flood insurance rate increase will affect the high-rise developments. Building management will have to pass the increased costs on to the renters through their monthly rents and maintenance fees. The NORC in these high-rise developments are on a fixed income and will find it hard to pay the increase. With these increasing rates, people will be forced out of their homes. We would call this insurance gentrification, where the neighborhood would change because of the increase in flood insurance rates.   Detriments with Traffic and the Denial of the Coney Island NYC Ferry Line  The traffic problem in the area has gotten worse with the new developments. The NYC Ferry will not come to Coney Island after extensive study on dredging Coney Island Creek, resulting in more frequently than anticipated annual dredging. To maintain the dredging, it would have cost over $45 million dollars to clear the channel on a bi-annual basis. The other suggestion was to put it on the beach/oceanside but to do this, it would cost $90-$200 million dollars to build a breakwater to protect the dock. Both options had a high price tag, but no one is willing at this time to flip the bill. Therefore, EDC will not bring the ferry system to Coney Island.   Subway Stations Becoming ADA Compliant  We need to concentrate on making our subway stations ADA compliant with elevators such as the F Train - Neptune Avenue, Q Train - Ocean Parkway, etc. These stations are used by the NORC population in our community.    Future Developments  We need to look at all the future developments and how it impacts on the traffic and parking in the area. After the infrastructure projects are completed, we need to see how all these developments affect the community. With COVID-19 not on high alert, we learned that there will be new problems that will need to be addressed. Retrofitting of the schools, unemployment, closing businesses, vaccine/booster distributions, etc. are a few issues that everyone must face in the coming years. The City budget must address those needs for the neighborhood to flourish.   Proposed Casino in Coney Island  Since the last report, Coney Island has been a targeted site for the proposed casino in the amusement area. The community came together for a community participation meeting in March and April 2023. At both meetings, the community residents were against the casino project. During the summer, the lobbyists reached out to local basketball clinics and sponsored many tournaments for the youth. At the time of this report, we do not know if Coney Island will be chosen as one of the locations and licensee in the metropolitan area.   Issuing of Licenses for Cannabis Dispensaries  We are concerned with the issues of licensed cannabis dispensaries located within our community. There are constant changes in rules and regulations coming from the NYS Office of Cannabis Management. We need guidance to make sure our community does not become an unwanted home for cannabis dispensaries.   Illegal Vendor Situations in Coney Island  Illegal vendor situations in both Coney Island (during the summer season) and Brighton Beach (year-round), have gotten out of hand. We need a coordinated taskforce that will work on this issue. The new Neighborhood Support Team has been slow in taking steps to rid the community of these vendors. Now, due to DCWP no longer being the lead and DSNY has been given the task of summonsing these illegal vendors in both areas, things are slowly moving in the right direction.   Importance of Drones  We need Drones! - drones are being used for public safety situations by FDNY, NYPD and Parks (assisting lifeguards in locating victims and bringing them life preservers to save them!). These agencies will need additional funds to purchase these important devices - where will these funds come from? ","","","","","Infrastructure resiliency","","Sandy Recovery and Future Resiliency: High-rise structures, notably those of the City's Housing Authority, evidence of the storm’s devastation – the presence of mold, the shuttered community centers, abandoned homes, empty stores and civic facilities.  NYCHA buildings currently constructing 2nd floor generators to prevent future floodings.  Homes were not qualified for the back flow prevention program the State had promised to the residents.  The shoreline is our other concern. Nothing has been done to protect us from the next superstorm. We need short term solutions such as planting beach sea grass and putting in dunes along the shoreline. Long term projects,will have to deal with the Army Corp of Engineers to build a sea wall in the Rockaway Inlet. Currently, there are plans to construct 6 large residential developments in our community. Each development has between 200-500 units. We need to upgrade our infrastructure to sustain the new developments. The sewer lines need to handle the new load of people moving into the neighborhood. As mentioned below with traffic, these developments do not provide adequate parking and therefore the new residents will be forced to find street parking. ","Traffic","","Traffic is one of the overwhelming problems in the peninsula. During the summer season, motorists come in and out of Coney Island and Brighton Beach, they are looking for free parking spots.  When they realized there are no parking spots, they circle around the area waiting for someone to leave.  This happens throughout the summer and residents feel hostage in their home, afraid to leave and lose their parking spot.  There is limited amount of parking spaces and parking lots once they are filled up the streets.  This causes a traffic nightmare.  Emergency vehicles from Fire, Police, ambulances, EMS have difficulties reaching to their locations where time is an essence.  One solution having people use mass transit.  We finally have express service on the F train to Coney Island.  We no longer have the ferry system come to Coney Island due to the enornmous cost of dredging the Coney Island Creek.  Another solution is to have offsite parking and have people shuttled in on a jitney buses to their locations.  This would partial alleviate the congestion coming into the area, and would give people an alternate route of getting out of the area.","Other - Write In (Required)","","Fixing up the Reigelmann Boardwalk - The Riegelmann Boardwalk has been neglected for so many years.  Community Board #13 has  put this in as a Top 3 important item to address.  We understand there is a huge amount of funds to fix and maintain the boardwalk.  It still needs to be fix and have a plan to have future maintenance, so we don’t run into this problem again. ","","","","","Other - Write In (Required)","","Community Board #13 needs a C1 Trauma Center in South Brooklyn Health (formerly Coney Island Hospital). Our hospital needs to address the growing population in the area. Time is of essence when a trauma patient is taken away from the area. If there was a C1 Trauma Center incorporated into South Brooklyn Health, it would cut down the time for helping the patient. We understand that this is not a City Budget item, but we need to make this situation aware to the city, state and federal government, that this is a priority for the neighborhood.   With this pandemic, we need all the medical facilities to handle COVID19. ","Community Board #13 needs a C1 Trauma Center in South Brooklyn Health (formerly known as Coney Island Hospital).

We understand that this is not a City Budget item but we need to make this aware to the city, state and federal government, that this is a priority for the neighborhood.   There are programs that have been funded in the current year. We would like these fundings to continue with the following requests: Funding is needed for South Brooklyn Health to handle the growing population and has to keep up with the medical needs in the area, such as obesity awareness, diabetes prevention program, cancer awareness, high blood pressure reduction program, living with asthma, improving pediatric care, preventing heart disease, etc.  With a growing population, South Brooklyn Health has to meet up with the demand. Funding must continue to keep up with medical needs and expand the hospital wherever it is possible.  We need to promote quit smoking programs for the immigrant community. The program must be translated into other languages to reach the target audience. There is a growing immigration population such as Pakistanian, Ukrainian, Russian, Spanish and Asian. They are either unaware or afraid to enter a hospital because of a language barrier or afraid of deportation. The neighborhood health facilities has to conform to the neighborhood and outreach to the immigrant in their native language or the patient will not come. ","Community Board #13 is a growing Naturally Occurring Retirement Communities (NORC). Community Board #13 has the largest senior population in NYC (23.3% of our population is over 65 years old)!  With an aging community, we have to address the needs of this growing population. We find the older residents tend to live independently with their services nearby. As household size decreases and income is fixed, the residents downsize their apartments and remain in the area. Health care providers are needed to check in to see if everything is okay. Senior centers have grown giving the residents something to do during the day. With new housing developments coming into the neighborhood, there will be some senior residents occupying the new units. The new seniors will need additional senior services and they will overtax the existing senior services. The City has to build new senior centers or combine them with recreation center to create an intergenerational recreation center to bring the generation gap closer together. There is a large Asian population that uses the JCCGCI center on West 37th Street where the clients come from all over the borough. Their needs are different in culture and traditions and it would great to integrate with the rest of the community. A multicultural center would be able to address the growing Asian senior population.  In Brighton Beach area, APNA Brooklyn Center has addressed the growing Muslim community.  They have expanded and helped the Pakistians with basic needs in the neighborhood.  The Shorefront Y and the Shorefront Jewish Community Council address the Russian and Ukrainian population in Brighton Beach.  Their programs are expanding to address the NORC community.   More senior services are needed in the neighborhood. ","There has been an increasing amount of seasonal homelessness in our community. Homeless people come down during the warmer months but never seem to leave until the weather becomes brutally cold. We need to address this problem year round. We DO NOT need a homeless shelter to address this problem because the community already has over seven NYCHA developments in a half mile radius. Coney Island has been the dumping ground for low income families and does not need to oversaturate the area with a homeless shelter. There are more affordable housing being built in our area.  We do not saturate the area with more low income developments. The City needs to address the existing problems in the neighborhood before receiving a new shelter. There are programs that have been funded in the current year. We would like these funding to continue with the following requests: More rental assistance program is needed to help the homeless people in the community. We need anti-eviction legal services to prevent people from becoming homeless.  We continued to support increase personnel Dept. of Homeless Services/Breaking Ground. More personnel is needed due to the increase of homeless people in the community. We need to expand street outreach to handle the seasonal homeless during the summer months. ","We need to help the low-income and vulnerable people in our community by providing job training, placement support, food assistance such as Food Stamps, improve delivery of emergency food and shelter in case of disaster. We also need to provide social services to domestic violence survivors and provide case management for persons living with HIV or AIDS. With over seven NYCHA developments, there are not enough programming to address the issues. We DO NOT need a homeless shelter, it would burden the area with more problems. There are programs that have been funded in the current year. We would like these funding to continue with the following requests: We need to expand our job training for the community. We have Workforce1 for Sandy victims, but we need to make it a permanent program. We need to have a training/vocational center to teach the people a skill.  We need to expand our job search and placement support for the community. It is vital to make the people job ready and to keep the job with placement support.  In our low-income neighborhood, we need to expand food assistance for getting healthy choices to the people.  There is a need to provide social services for domestic violence survivors. The community needs more information for the victims to know their rights.  We need to provide case management, cash assistance and social services for people living with clinically symptomatic HIV or AIDS. With no community based organization dealing with the HIV/AIDS issue we need funding for community. With this pandemic, we realized the low income children were neglected by not getting proper digital tools for school. People who were laid off from their jobs needed more food resources and job opportunities.   Businesses are closed and unemployment checks are finished, people need assistance. ","","","","","Other - Write In (Required)","","Our biggest concern in our neighborhood is reopening our community center that was destroyed by Superstorm Sandy. After ten  years, some community centers/daycare centers are still closed and need to reopen soon. The youth have no where to go and limited resources out here to occupy them during the year. Wokforce1 has helped the young adults but the community centers are need for the children. Safe community centers need to be rebuilt and made resilient to address the needs of the area. A long term solution is to build a recreational center to address this need that would be intergenerational, multicultural, educational, multi-use recreational facility. This could be tied in with a boathouse to do water activities, too.  ","Our biggest concern in our neighborhood is reopening our community center that was destroyed by Superstorm Sandy.

We would like these funding to continue until completed with the following requests:  A full library are needed in our schools. The current library are not well stock and being under utilized without programs. With the school giving healthier choices to students during meal times, it is needed to explain to them that it is a life choice to make. Giving the youth nutritional program to educate them on what is healthy and what is junk food is greatly need. Also, we would like to look into the greenhouse garden to have the youth understand where the food is coming from and how they can prepare healthy for that they have grew will give them an idea where the healthy foods come from. The school buildings need to be retrofitted so the teachers and students have a safe place to go in case there are future pandemics.  We need to bring back Workforce1 storefront instead of them having a mobile office in the neighborhood.  ","The early stages of child development is very important and we need quality childcare services in our daycare and head start centers. We need to rebuild childcare centers and improve on their service. After Superstorm Sandy, childcare and head starts center were destroyed and had to be rebuilt. Some are still not rebuilt and the void needs to be filled. The centers are either doubled up or ceased to exist. We have to rebuild or build new centers to have quality childcare services. There are programs that have been funded in the current year. We would like these funding to continue with the following requests:  We need to expand options for kinship foster care services to help family integrate the child into their new environment.  We need juvenile justice programs and preventive services in our neighborhood.  We need to expand preventive services to avoid future delinquents in the community.  All child care centers were affected by Superstorm Sandy needs to be renovated and upgrade to avoid future disaster.  We need to continue support to increase personnel for monitoring of day care centers  The community needs adequate funding for preventative and child protection services. In low-income neighborhood, child protection services generally gets overlooked.  We need to provide funding for youth program for 18 to 21 year olds who have aged out or been discharged from foster care services because at that age, the young adult has not been fully adapted to their new environment and without an education, they are likely not to get a high paying job. They will become the new homeless in our community. ","","","","","Traffic violations and enforcement","","In our district, we are number one in crime reduction in NYC.  With youth crime and gun violence down in our neighborhood, we now can concentrate on the quality of life issues such as traffic congestions and parking problems.  With the hot summer days or big events in the area, we have traffic problems in getting people in and out of the area.  People are held hostage trying to leave the area and cannot find parking when they returned home.  We need to address this as a safety concern when emergency vehicles cannot move through the neighborhood without being stop by traffic.","A summer detail is made available for the 60th Precinct, but growing crowds indicate that added personnel is needed. We need additional uniformed officers to keep law and order in community that has summer crowds in the thousands. The community is neglected when the officers are diverted to control the crowds. We need traffic enforcement officers to help direct traffic coming and going out of the area. We need them to keep the traffic flowing and ticket motorists for double parking and illegally blocking traffic in the area. There are programs that have been funded in the current year. We would like these funding to continue with the following requests: - Continue support for additional staff to address specific crimes such as drug, gang-related issues. - We need to continue to support resources to train officers in NCO and YCO to help with better relationships with the community. - We request to have heavy duty equipment such as heavy duty helmets and vests. With huge crowds in the summer time, we feel that it is an easy target for terrorist attacks and we should be equipment to handle the situation.  We would like to see how we can use drones in our area to assist with chronic problems. ","Our community stress highly on emergency/disaster services needs. Ever since Superstorm Sandy, we have found ourselves vulnerable to the environment and the increasing developments around the area. We need to be prepared for any situation whether it be another Superstorm Sandy, or a blizzard or even a blackout we have to protect our community. Even with this pandemic, a local emergency center for emergency/disaster/ pandemic assistance is needed.  We need something that is central and is recognize by the community a place to get help and information.  We would like to see how we can use drones in our area to assist with high rise fires and drowning victims along the beach.  ","","","","","Protective infrastructure (sea walls, flood walls, etc.)","","After Superstorm Sandy, the community realized that our shorelines were not protected and we must protect our infrastructures.   Short terms goals such as sand dunes, are needed for immediate protection.  Long term goals such as living breakwaters will take time to implement and construct.  We need to proceed with a definitive plan for the area, so that another hurricane season doesn't pass by without preventive measures in place.","Our biggest issue is to protect our shoreline from the next disaster. After Superstorm Sandy, we realized how vulnerable our shoreline is during a hurricane. We need to upgrade and maintain our sewer lines. Currently, DDC is upgrading our sewer lines at West 16 Street, we need to continue this throughout the whole community.  DDC is reconstructing the streets with porous pavements; we hope this is successful and would be able to replace the remaining streets with this porous pavements.  We found out the City does not have funds to relocate our sanitation garage. We have been waiting since 1983 to move this garage which will house two sanitation district. We will put this in as a top proirity for the area. There are programs that have been funded in the current year.  We continue support to clean our catch basins throughout our community. We realized when Superstorm Sandy inundated the area with water, the catch basins backed up because they were never properly cleaned.  We need to continue to expand the noise abatement programs and enforcement programs in the community. With our amusement area, there tends to have vendors who blast their music into the community. We need to have enforcement come out to fine these vendors who do not comply.  We need air quality monitoring systems to measure the air quality in our community.  Since Superstorm Sandy, residents have more respiratory problems and needs to be looked into.  Also, with the pollution Coney Island Creek which adds to the air problem. ","Construction of Sanitation Garage for Community Board #13 has been promised to the community since 1980. The current site is on West 21 Street and the trucks are situated behind people's backyards. We heard earlier this year that the funding was not available for the garage.  We are still interested in moving the sanitation garage to the new location. It will house two garages (BK13 and BK15) at the new site. We need the City to put the funding back into the relocation of the garage.  There are programs that have been funded in the current year. We would like these funding to continue with the following requests:  We need to continue to clean up the vacant lots that are privately and city owned lots. We need to have the lots cleaned to show the community that we are not here to be dumped on.  Continue to support Sanitation Police Illegal Dumping Task Force.  We continue to support enforcement of dirty sidewalk, dirty area, and failure to clean area laws. Property owners and commercial owners need to know they are responsible to keeping their area clean. We need enforcement officers to keep on top of the litter.  We need to increase enforcement of illegal posting laws. We need to educate groups that it is illegal to do posting on certain poles.  Also, we need to fine the distributors so they understand where they can post.  We would like to continue support for NYC organics collection programs for our neighborhood. We understand that composting organic items will be keep the environment cleaner.  We need to provide more frequent organics and recycling collection service for schools and institutions. With the collection of the organic items, they tend to decompose quickly and the smell cannot be housed in the location for too long before it becomes a health hazard.  With the Sanitation Police having the new enforcement power over illegal vendors, we need to work with the PEP officers during the summer to tackle the problem in the amusement area.  ","","","","","Workforce development (including MWBE opportunities)","","Workforce1 is essential to the neighborhood.  Creating jobs and training skills for young adults are very important.  We need to expand the program and give more job opportunities to the community. ","We need to have more building inspectors to enforce the building codes in the neighborhood. Illegal conversions of buildings are being subdivided and are not up to code. It is a health and safety concern dealing with unlivable conditions and fire hazard with overloading the existing utilities. We need to do a land use study to see what is present and available and what is needed for the future. There are programs that have been funded in the current year. We would like these funding to continue with the following requests:  Increase compliance division - Dept. of Buildings. We continue to support the need to assign additional building inspectors for code enforcements because property owners are constructing illegal conversions in the area and needs to be fined and stopped. We continued to support the need to address illegal conversions and uses of buildings. We get complaints from the neighborhood, and it needs to be resolved. ","Our concern in our community board for housing is our area is being overdevelop with apartments. Property owners are building apartments on a small parcel of property. We are oversaturated with large developments that our infrastructures made not handle the increase. Our concern is with traffic flow and parking. With new developments, there isn't enough adequate parking space to accommodate the renters. We need to continue to address the housing issues in the area by support our local housing groups. There are programs that have been funded in the current year. We would like these funding to continue with the following requests: - Continue support for Home Improvement program, Article 8A and PLP Loans - We need to expand programs for housing inspections to correct code violations in the high rise building. Management needs to correct violations in a timely manner or receive hefty fines for not being in compliance. - Continued support to expand tenant protection programs letting tenants know their rights. We need to support our existing housing groups and expand their services to the tenants. - We need to renovate and upgrade public housing developments. Since Superstorm Sandy, there are items still not fix, such as boiler system, community centers and other basic needs. - We need our community centers in NYCHA developments to be repaired and opened. Since Superstorm Sandy, our community centers have been closed and our youth have no where to play. - We need to improve public housing maintenance and cleanliness throughout the NYCHA developments. The lobby area needs to be kept clean and the grounds need to be tidy. We need to work with management with the office hours. We have renters who cannot meet during business hours without taking a day off. Extended nights and weekend shifts should be accommodating to the developments. Also, translation on notices are needed for people to read in their native language. ","We need economic development to the area to stimulate the community. With economic development comes jobs for the community. It will help the local economy and bring new business into the area. With the development of residential and commercial projects, we have to remember of the traffic problems, limited parking spaces and other infrastructure issues. We cannot develop without looking at the existing infrastructure and how it will impact on our limited services. There are programs that have been funded in the current year. We would like these funding to continue with the following requests: We need to improve our streetscapes in business district to attract and encourage commercial activities. We also need to make the street lights more resilient to future storms. We would like to have the street light run on solar panels so they are not dependent on the power lines. We need to expand access to low cost financing to help neighborhood businesses construct or improve space. We know it is hard to obtain business loans for store improvements, we need to make it easier to apply and approve them.  We need to support non-profit organizational development and capacity building for improving the commercial strip.  After Superstorm Sandy, we need to provide business recovery assistance after an emergency. The community realize that we were not prepared to help our businesses after an emergency.  We have youth that have not graduated from high school and can't get into college without job skills or job training. Workforce1 helps youth and adults in employment services but we also need to provide them with skills.  Support for Job Training programs in C.B. 13. We need to expand occupational skills training programs to help our local residents.  We need to support recruitment and hiring of employees in our neighborhood. We need to continue to support Workforce1 and bring it back to a storefront office.  We need to improve disaster preparation for small businesses. After Superstorm Sandy, businesses were not prepared to handle a disaster.  We need to programs to support local businesses and entrepreneurs. After Superstorm Sandy part of the neighborhood had a hard time re-opening their businesses and decided to close their stores. Since then, it has been a hardship to repair their stores and attract new businesses to the area. We need to address these issues.  We need to support immigrant, minority, veteran and women-owned, as well as local and new businesses. We understand the minority are the hardest to work through the system, whether it be discrimination or a language barrier, we need to fix it.  We need to provide assistance for minority women-owned businesses and small businesses in responding to bids and request for proposal. The businesses have to understand the process of working with the system to bid on proposals. Economic subsidies/tax breaks/grants are needed to bring back the businesses and jobs.   ","","","","","Traffic safety and enforcement (cars, scooters, ebikes, etc.)","","With successful developments come increased problems with traffic.  It is one of the key worries for the peninsula.  Motorists coming in and out of Coney Island, Brighton Beach, Sea Gate and Gravesend find themselves trapped in bumper-to-bumper traffic.  During a major event or a hot summer weekend, it is a traffic nightmare and it has now become a safety issue for emergency vehicles getting around the neighborhood.   It is a sad fact for residents of Coney’s west and Sea Gate to find themselves stuck in gridlock for an hour in order to leave the vicinity; some simply turn back home. Traffic enforcement officers to ticket illegal cars double parked or direct traffic to flow smoothly during major events are needed in the area.","As mentioned before, traffic congestion and limited parking spaces are a major issue in the area during the summer time. We need to do a traffic survey to alleviate the congestion issue and figure out what can be done. One idea is to build multi-deck parking lots to accommodate the increasing cars coming into the community. The MTA needs to provide express service to Coney Island so people can travel to and from the area in less than a hour. There are programs that have been funded in the current year. We would like these funding to continue with the following requests:  Reconstruction streets, sidewalks.  We need to install streetscape improvements for our area.  After Superstorm Sandy, we need to provide new resilient street lights. Power was off for two weeks during Sandy, and everything was completely dark after sundown. If we had solar panel street lights, we would have been partly in the dark and would have felt more secured. ","The city, borough, and community all urge people to use public transportation, and, in the case of summertime Coney Island and Brighton Beach, it is the wisest move, but Transit uses weekend hours to fix its subway lines for needed rail and station work. The resultant shifts in movement of F, D, and other lines prove delays and confusion. The result: people may use their cars. We need to improve on the bus service coming into the area. We need to have express bus service over the weekend and SBS B82 ending in Coney Island rather than stopping at Cropsey Avenue and 25th Avenue. Also, we need more electronic kiosks to notify the public how long until the bus arrives at the stop.  We are not getting the ferry service to Coney Island Creek.  We still need a ferry on the beach side. ","","","","","Other - Write In (Required)","","With the new landmark status for the boardwalk, the Community Board would like it to be fixed and maintained so it can be preserved as a landmark.  We know there are challenges in getting the boardwalk fixed but now it has gotten to the point where it is unsafe in certain area and need to be address.  We understand there are limits with the carpenters and the actual time to work on the boardwalk during the off season but there has to be a better way to fix the boardwalk before it become a safety hazard and lawsuits to follow with people tripping over loose planks and screws.  We hope this can be address since this is our number one priority in our capital budget.","As mention before, we need to protect our shoreline from the next major storm. We have to secure the shoreline or all will be washed away with the next major storm. In addition, we need to repair and maintain our boardwalk. With part of the boardwalk falling apart will lead to lawsuit against the City. We need to fix the bathrooms and rebuild the ones on the west end of Coney Island. We need a New recreational center at West 23rd Street/Kaiser Park. The community needs an affordable recreational center that will be intergeneration, multicultural, educational, nature conservatory, ice skating rink, adult vocational training center, emergency center, greenhouse, boathouse, sport related activities, indoor skate board park, boxing ring, etc. This center would be located next to and behind Mark Twain JHS which would wrap around to West 23rd Street to West 25th Street. This would also include parking space/garage for people using the facility. We would like to model the recreational center like Ocean Breeze Complex in Staten Island.  We lost a child due to drowning at the beach. The child was swimming in an area where there were no lifeguards present.  We need more lifeguards with new life saving technology.  We would like the Parks Department to invest in drones to assist the lifeguards in spotting drowning victims in the water and bringing life preservers to the drowning victims.  We understand this maybe new and expensive but can we put a price on a child's life if we could save them from drowning?  There are programs that have been funded in the current year. We would like these funding to continue until completed with the following requests: We need to hire more lifeguards for our beaches to prevent any lost of life.  Renovation work on Asser Levy Park: infrastructure improvements to halt flooding; landscaping; etc.  Upgrade Scarangella Park with comfort station and other amenity.   We need more mobi-mats for accessibility to the beach.  We need PEP officers at the beaches, boardwalk and Asser Levy Park to crack down illegal vendors selling to the public.  Increase funds to keep Boardwalk bathrooms open to later hours.  Continued support to increase personnel for Parks.  Add light-weight vehicles for work on Boardwalk and beach; maintenance of vehicles to ensure ready use of light-weight vehicles.  Tree Removal and Replacement:  We continued to support the street tree maintenance throughout the community.  We need to have public programming and activation of public spaces on City-owned sites. Help support the Operation GreenThumb Gardens in our neighborhood: Santos Community Garden, West 29th Street Surfside Gardens, and West 23rd Street Community Garden. ","We need a New recreational center in Kaiser Park. The community needs an affordable recreational center that will be intergeneration, multicultural, educational, nature conservatory, adult vocational training center, emergency center, greenhouse, boathouse, sport related activities, ice skating rink, indoor skate board park, boxing ring, etc. This center would be located behind Mark Twain JHS which would wrap around to West 23rd Street to West 25th Street. This would also include parking space/garage for people using the facility. We would like to model the recreational center like Ocean Breeze Complex in Staten Island. ","We need to upgrade our library facilities with more computers and innovative ideas to attract readers and the community.  We need to expand the library hours and have weekend services, too.  We also need more diverse variety of books in other language for the immigrant population.","We need to continue increase our presence in the area for people to use the community board as the central agency to handle local and community wide issues.  We need to expand the staff and hire consultants to address the issues and solve current issues.    We also need to relocate the board office to the ground floor to be closer to the public.  This will give us the presence in the neighborhood.","","","","","Explanation","","","","","","","","","","BK13","","","","","","","","","","",""

The district embraces 2.9 square miles. In 2020 the population increased to 164,600 up from 160,660 in 2010 but down from a high of 168,806 in 2000. CD14 remains among the most diverse in New York City; and is the most diverse in Brooklyn as measured by the racial diversity index. Approximately 39% of the district is White; 10% is Asian; and 17% is of Hispanic origin. These percentages have shifted only slightly from 2010-2021 however, the Black/African- American population has decreased from 35 percent in 2010 to 26 percent in 2021. Within these racial categories, there is a rich myriad of nationalities and cultures. Nearly 39% of our District's population is foreign born as of 2021, down from 47% in 2010. The poverty rate in the district has reportedly dropped from 22% in 2010 to 17% in 2021. It is slightly higher for household with children under 18, and it is at 22% for those 65 years and older.   The vast majority of needs previously identified in this annual District Needs Statement have not been met in a meaningful way.  The continued recovery Covid 19 pandemic underscores the urgency of addressing health, housing, and socio-economic disparities, and educational, environmental and small business issues, at the local level.  Meeting budget priorities that are identified at the local level represents an investment in the community, which pays off when crises strike and positions our community to be safe, productive, and resilient. To the extent that the city continues to fail to respond meaningfully to local needs, and to not prioritize on the basis of community level data, we remain vulnerable.  We urge agencies to note lessons learned and to respond meaningfully to our community members are represented by our district needs and related budget requests.           ","","","","","Infrastructure resiliency","","There are many issues, various needs and many demographic, socio-economic and policy shifts that everything is a number one priority for someone. It is important that all city agencies strive to serve the public to the best of their ability and it is imperative that all city agencies get the support they need to do so.  Infrastructure resiliency includes street conditions/roadway, street bridge, mass transit maintenance and infrastructure; street flooding; maintenance and cleanliness of institutions, natural assets, and public space. There are five chronic flooding locations in the district that flood every time it rains more than 1.5 inches an hour. DEP has offered no city-based resolution. Legislation is pending in City Council that would direct DEP to help cover the cost of installing backflow prevention valves. This is worthy of consideration given that the Comptroller’s office has paid $4,826,552 in sewer overflow claims from (2017-2021).    Community District 14 still has not made DOT's list for scheduled trench condition repairs despite a growing number of locations, including in front of the District Office.  Three road bridges are scheduled for repair but the full scope has not been determined. The purview issues surrounding Newkirk Plaza disqualify the Newkirk Avenue bridge from a component contract and likely put the timing of repairs beyond the horizon.   DOT installs traffic calming devices with no maintenance plan so that weeds are higher than cars on pedestrian islands and delineators litter the roadway. DOT has allowed Citibike to install docks that force people to step into a truck route to dock the bike! DOT’s Open Restaurants program competes with other for-profit uses of the streets such as bike parking stations and electrical vehicle charging stations which also compete with public uses such as bike lanes and bus lanes. DOT has not explained how these competing interests will be prioritized, or the process by which local community members will be able to weigh in.  It is difficult to have confidence in expanding programs under DOT's watch when the agency has not responded to repair requests, has not maintained other assets, and has not improved the time it takes to respond to (for instance) speed hump requests (typically more than 3 years).   A request for a new precinct house has been a priority for three decades, as noted elsewhere in this report.   CD 14 is considered a transit zone but there have been no studies of station capacity.  Transit zoning text amendments that could increase station accessibility rest on happenstance rather than equity-based planning. To the extent that capacity, accessibility, equity and thus resiliency improvements are being made by agencies and utilities alike, there is insufficient coordination so that roadway disruptions are extended and use of the public right of way and public space in general is poorly planned. CB14 has advocated for restoring the B23 bus on Cortelyou Road but at this time the bud redesign anticipates removing all buses from Cortelyou - in part because the DOT installation on Coney Island Avenue makes the right turn difficult. There must be a way to address unanticipated consequences following policy decisions.  ","Parks and open space","","Several of CB14’s priorities have lingered on this list for years and even decades without being addressed or in some cases meaningfully acknowledged by the relevant agencies, including open space, relocation of the 70th police precinct house and a variety of baseline sanitation services.  Community Board 14 has the highest percentage citywide of residents who live more than a quarter mile away from a park.  This is more than an issue of recreation - it has serious public health ramifications.  Health disparities are exacerbated by the lack of outdoor recreational amenities. CB14 as advocated for Newkirk Plaza to be activated as a public plaza since DOT began the pedestrian plaza program, still to no avail.    The African burial ground at Bedford Avenue and Church Avenue has been transferred to the Department of Parks and Recreation to develop an important memorial.  This is a location that CD 14 identified as suitable for open space over a decade ago and now that the site has been identified as hallowed ground we trust that it will be adequately funded and opportunities for community input will be maximized in a variety of forums, with focus on the descendant community.   CB14 has requested that Umma Park and the Campus Road Tot Lot be fully rehabilitated.  We are gratified that there has been a councilmanic allocation for Umma Park from Councilmember Rita Joseph.  Still, we believe that DPR should have agency over their own capital budget so they do not rely solely on council allocations. This would ensure that parks are rehabilitated according to need, rather than the vagaries of districting.   A request to make Newkirk Plaza a public plaza has been denied by three different agencies. Conditions on the Plaza are in a downward spiral despite the fact that the plaza is already a plaza, MTA has indicated a willingness to sign agreements for plaza use, and the Flatbush Development Corp wants to serve as the community partner.  Mayor Adams made this same demand of the di Blasio administration in 2019; therefore, we have high hopes for a resolution now that he is Mayor.  The lack of agency accountability for the plaza must end and adoption into the DOT Pedestrian Plaza program makes the most sense.    The 70th Police Precinct must balance responding to crime, gang activity, quality of life complaints, and community relations in a racially, ethnically, religiously, and socio-economically diverse community. They do so from a precinct house that is located as far away from the heart of the district as can be. OMB approved a site search for a new precinct house three years ago but only three locations have been reviewed (and all rejected).  This is a request that CB 14 has made for over 30 years.  We remain stubbornly hopeful that the site search will yield positive results.   Every year for over a decade we have had to request for the restoration of some baseline DSNY service or another. This year we urge the city to restore Manual Litter Patrol (MLP).  TNT is not a substitute for MLP. Currently MLP is provided in the district only through city council grants so it cannot be provided throughout the district. In the past elected officials have been asked to fund baskets and basket collections. These are baseline services and should be paid directly through DSNY's own budget so that the services are provided equally throughout the district and additional grants can support special projects, such as graffiti removal, catch basin clearing or tree pit maintenance, none of which fall within any agency purview. ","Street conditions (roadway maintenance)","","We receive more service delivery requests for issues related to DOT than any other agency. Community members generate requests for traffic studies; street conditions; for traffic calming such as speed humps, stop signs, traffic signals; changes in alternate side of the street parking; sidewalk conditions; bike lanes that make sense and more. In addition, DOT has initiated installations of pedestrian islands; curb extensions; bike lane expansions; and safety measures near schools.  The requests and initiatives too often do not intersect.  With so many projects and requests and with the increased development in the area, CB14 continues to encourage DOT to implement changes based on data and studies of the specifics of the areas that will be affected by projects and to include the community in the early phases of proposal development.    ","","","","","Services to reduce or prevent homelessness","","Health care and human service needs are intertwined. Services for low income and vulnerable adults, for seniors and those who are homebound overlap with disease prevention and mental health services. Substandard housing has a substantial impact on health and mental health. Once an individual has become homeless, a whole host of services have not been made available or have failed. Prevention is the best care. In a community-wide survey, affordable housing and programs for unsheltered homeless individuals ranked the highest and prevention programs ranked second.  Housed: CB 14 continues to rank high in severe housing overcrowding. More than 32% of our tenants are severely rent burdened (paying more than 50% of their income on rent) which is up from 29% in 2010. The district ranks second citywide in the number of serious housing code violations per 1000 units of housing. In 2019, 57% of housing units were affordable at 80% AMI, which was 13% fewer than in 2010. The percentage at 30% of AMI has also dropped from 4.9 to 3.9%. This housing insecurity manifests in a growing number of unsheltered homeless individuals who were previously housed in the community. It is exceedingly difficult to move a person off the street, once they have become homeless. Therefore, prevention is of paramount importance.   On any given night, nearly 50,000 people will sleep in NYC shelters; this includes more than 10,138 families, including 16,000 children as well as 18,357 single adults. These were the numbers before the overwhelming influx of 70,000 migrant individuals and families with children.   Community Board 14 accepts a role in hosting shelters in the community. However, locations, populations served, and providers must be transparently considered. DHS contracted with the Children’s Rescue Fund to operate a women’s’ shelter on Kenilworth Place. The lack of transparency in this process is well-documented and the Community Advisory Board (CAB) has met no more than twice in the 3 years it’s been in operation. Black Vets for Social Justice operates in a men's shelter on Duryea Place, practically on the loading dock of Kings Theater and next door to a supportive housing facility for people experiencing mental illness. From its opening on May 5, 2023 to October 24, 2023 when the Black Vets for Social Justice held its first CAB meeting, there were 263 911 calls to the shelter. In addition, residents have called 311 related to the shelter and its residents. Program and security capacity must be increased. ","Health: Of note is the aging of CD14's population. In 2010 those age 65 and better was 9.8%; by 2021 it rose to 17.3%. The DOHMH Community Health Survey reports that CD14 individuals in that age group experience more hospitalizations from falls than the city-wide and borough-wide averages at 1,767 per 100,000. While most health indices such as asthma rates, maternal health rates, obesity, diabetes and hypertension rates are on par with the city-wide and borough-wide averages, CD14 does have lower rates of health insurance and higher numbers of our residents do not seek timely medical attention. It should be noted that food access is increasingly troublesome. There are 14 bodegas for every grocery store in CD14. The best ratio is the city is 3 bodegas to 1 grocery store and the worst is 19:1. We are far closer to the worst than the best.  As has been stated for years and as will be repeated in other sections of this report, CD ranks last in the city in terms of access to parks and greenspace. We have the highest percentage of people who live more than a quarter mile away from a park. In 2018, the Fund for the City of New York awarded a planning fellow to CB14 who assembled a report with worthy recommendations. It can be found on CB14's website. We continue to advocate for the greening of CD14. ","According to the Department for the Aging's analysis of Census data, the population of older New Yorkers is increasing as a share of the total population. In 2010 it was 9% and in 2019 the population over 65 grew to 17%. The population of those over the age of 85 is increasing the most, but ""younger"" older New Yorkers seeking services is on the rise. From 2010-2021, the poverty rate in CD14 dropped from 22-17%. For those age 65 and older it dropped a bit less, from 26-22%, remaining higher than the full population. These shifts require new focus on providing support services for aging New Yorkers. Still, the number of senior centers in the district remains flat and there has been only one housing development for seniors in 2020 when Church of the Redeemer leadership built an as-of-right, 88 studio unit building for seniors and women aging out of foster care.  ","On any given night, nearly 50,000 people will sleep in NYC shelters; this includes more than 10,138 families, including 16,000 children as well as 18,357 single adults. These were the numbers before the overwhelming influx of 70,000 migrant men, women and children.  Community Board 14 accepts a role in hosting shelters in the community. However, the location, the population served, and the provider must be transparently considered. DHS is has contracted with the Children's Rescue Fund to operate a women's' shelter on Kenilworth Place. The lack of transparency in this process is well-documented. The Community Advisory Board for that shelter has met no more than twice in the 3 years it's been in operation. Black Vets for Social Justice operates in a men's shelter on Duryea Place, practically on the loading dock of Kings Theater and next door to a supportive housing facility for people experiencing mental illness. As anticipated and articulated by community members, this not a location primed to serve the 200 men housed there and it places an undue burden on this one-block of residents. The complaints and requests for agency intervention (and police assistance) are frequent and continue to escalate. Nevertheless, despite repeated requests, this shelter has not held a single CAB to date. Since April 2023, DHS has been directly operating a migrant shelter for families on Coney Island Avenue. As of October 2023, there is still no community-based organization in place; the loss of service and support in that time has only exacerbated the crises and places an undue burden on the schools serving the children of these families. Shelters must be opened with higher potential for success than any of these current plans offer. In addition, the city is still claiming to site shelters equitably in all community districts. However, the two new shelters in CB14 are within a mile of one shelter in CD12 and another in CD17. That's four shelters within two miles, which is not geographically equitable.  As for the unsheltered homeless individuals, Breaking Ground is Brooklyn's DSS contractor and provides excellent service, yet there have been reports of response slowing and it takes on average 250 encounters with street outreach teams before individuals will accept services. What does this say about the efficacy of services offered? It seems time for a paradigm shift. The Midwood Safehaven is at capacity. Such programs should be expanded with the best interest of the community in mind.    ","Community Board 14 continues to host non-profit roundtable events each year in order to stay aware of needs being met by Community Based Organizations (CBO), who they are serving, and what type of support they need to manage and expand caseloads. In the past we brought the CBOs together with city agencies and nonprofit support organizations to expand their capacity and strengthen the CBO network in our community. The 2022 Nonprofit Roundtable featured Comptroller Brad Lander, who spoke about the City's efforts to improve contract registration and timely contract payments.  These efforts have not reached our local CBOs as of yet. The need for these changes are critical as organizations continue to serve a growing number of more urgent needs in our community. Last year the roundtable offered extended break-out group time, and the feedback from the organizations was overwhelmingly positive, demonstrating the value of quilting together the invaluable programs and services provided by our nonprofit community. Gsiven how many city services are provided through contracting, supporting this element of our community is critical. Three years ago, CB14  organized a lunch and learn series to explore affordable housing for our community, the videos and resources from that series are housed on CB14's newly redesigned website. At a time when the wealthier strata of our community is growing, it is important to maintain focus on those in or close to the poverty line.  Human services are an investment in the productivity and resiliancy of our community.  ","","","","","Juvenile justice and services for at-risk youth","","Issues related to Youth, Education and Child Welfare are intertwined and it is important to knit services and resources together and break through silos. For the past 16 years CB 14 has organized a Youth Conference, which has attracted over 500 young community members to meet with 80 organizations, agencies and job providers. The need for youth workforce development, youth employment, youth justice and youth centered cure violence programs are more urgent than ever and we continue to advocate for an even greater expansion of DYCD, and ACS funding and CBO support contracts that are registered and paid on time. Contracting methodology should be reviewed by the city. It seems odd that CB6, which for households with members under the age of 18 has a poverty rate of 5% and receives $2,9990,908 in DYCD contracts, and our district receives $2,042481despite a significantly higher poverty rate of 18% in households with minors.  Youth workforce development garnered the most support in the youth section of CB14's community needs survey. Interestingly, cure violence programs received the highest percentage of support in the public safety section of the survey; underscoring the relationship of services to one another (the community gets it)!  Community Board 14 has identified the need for expanded school seats as a budget priority for well over a decade and the Department of Education has recognized the need but has not fulfilled it. We urge DOE and SCA to assess the post pandemic need for elementary school seats. In the meantime, new private schools and charter schools have been opened and require support such as crossing guards.  There must be a recognition that income disparities, housing disparities, and the disparities in parental educational attainment, as well as first languages spoken at home, family size and more, make learning challenging in different ways in different households. The children of migrant families are being added to the rolls of our public schools without a CBO in place at the shelter, which puts additonal family support pressures on the schools.   ","There are 35 public elementary and secondary schools in the district which served more than 20,000 students pre-pandemic. In addition, there are more than 26 private/parochial elementary and secondary schools with 6709 students. The public elementary schools in our district were over capacity - ranging up to 151% over enrolled (topping last year's high of 146% over enrolled). The City has recognized our need for additional seats in the district for well over a decade and a post pandemic assessment is needed to ascertain current needs. Our schools have a higher than citywide average of ELL students, which is increasing as children from migrant families in shelters are added to the rolls. Over 30 different first languages are represented on one of our elementary schools. Given school overcrowding, stresses on social services, guidance counseling and technology access concerns, this district is at greater risk of grade level and on time graduation backsliding.  This will be a long term issue. Services for immigrant youth, afterschool programs and early childhood development are all rated as a top need on the district's NDA survey. ","Twenty-five percent of CD14's population is under the age of 17; 34% is under the age of 24. The poverty rate in CD14 has fallen from 25% in 2000 to 17% in 2021; however the poverty rate for households with children under 18 is still 25%.  DYCD programs such as Compass and SYEP are in high demand in the district.  The expansion of ACS programs for justice involved youth seem to be increasingly untilized by cure violence groups and by the YNCO's from the 70th Precinct.  Support for cure violence programs in the public safety section of CB14's budget proirities survey were the number one priority by far.  ","","","","","Public safety facilities (precinct, fire houses, etc.)","","A new 70th precinct house is still a high priority in the district based in part on the number of decades it has been identified as a priority combined with NYPD's investment without return in recent years.  In 2018, the NYPD Capital Unit conducted a $1 million feasibility study to determine that the current location is unsuitable. OMB then green-lighted a site search for a new location. They have considered three locations in three years and all were rejected.  A new location will not be easy to identify in our narrow 2.9 square mile district but the community and elected officials are all ready to provide assistance and support. It would be a detriment to the community to let yet another opportunity slip by yet there seems to be little to no focus and the responses to CB14's repeated requests inspires little confidence. The police department organizes so many ceremonies and events to honor members of the service. Then they send them off to work in stations houses that dishonors their value. When the SRG3 house was recently flooded from a combined sewer system during a storm, officers lost personal belongings and there wasn't a proper clean up for days. Buildings that don't leak from the roofs and flood from the basement should be the minimum expectation.   As the frequency of weather disasters continue to increase, the need for preparedness and response cannot be overstated. Fire safety and addressing general crime are at the core of a safe community. Zoning text amendments that anticipate energy storage as of right, must be coupled with FDNY capacity. Public nuisance complaints are on a steep rise in the district. The transfer of tobacco, electronic cigarettes and cannabis sales from NYPD to DCWP and the Sheriff's office has not been effective. The transfer of vendor enforcement from NYPD to DSNY is a bad idea that has been poorly implemented.   Traffic complaints and request for enforcement are also on the rise. It is very important that the community and its police force work together to benefit from shifts in a violence disruption and harm reduction model to deal with how youth crime and recidivism are addressed.   Traffic violations and enforcement are also recognized as pressing needs in the district. There has been very little impact on speeding vehicles, trucks that travel off routes, 53' trucks that should not be on city streets, and overnight commercial vehicle parking due to a lack of large tow vehicles, space in tow lots and the strain on human resources. ","The men and women of the 70th Police Precinct serve our community from a Precinct House that is poorly suited to their needs and to the needs of the community. The 70th Precinct House is undersized, antiquated and deteriorated. Adapt Community Network, which serves people with cerebral palsy, and the Joseph Belsky house, which serves low-income mobility impaired residents, share this very narrow, one-way street. Thus one of the most active Precinct Houses is in the midst of one of the largest concentrations of multiply handicapped people in the city. The number of schools in proximity to the precinct continues to increase. The shift to a cure violence model is well received by the borough and the precinct.  The ACS and DYCD programs that support CBOs that have become trusted messengers in the community must be adequately funded.  Bringing funding and program support to the community level and making sure they work in tandem with NYPD's responsibilities is a new challenge that we trust will yeild positive results. The number of crossing guards has not kept pace with need. Ensuring that the position offers incentives to attract and retain personnel is a priority.  Having enough personnel to fill in when guards call in or take leave is another measure that should be brought into practice.  ","None of the firehouses in CD 14 are slated for renovations or generators.  Given that mandatory inspections are based on Department of Buildings new construction, alteration and demolition permits and given that those permit applications are increasing, the need to ensure adequate resources for inspections is clear. Education programs to prevent fires and swift response are also key It remains distressing that response times continue to increase for FDNY and for EMS. The process by which FDNY approves DOT installations such as speed humps, pedestrian islands, and curb extensions has improved to ensure that local input is emphasized, but as DOT expands street and curb lane use to bike corrals, restaurants, protected bike lanes and more, we must ensure that additional amenities don't conflict with emergency response. The consideration of energy stgorage as of right, must align with DOB's code development and FDNY's capacity to address unintentded consequences. ","","","","","Water runoff and flooding","","CD14 has several chronic flooding locations which have been brought to the attention of DEP for years with no amelioration. Last year, Hurricane Ida was an extraordinary event that certainly brought a great deal of attention to our hard-hit community; this year tropical storm Ophelia hit on September 29th did the same because no action followed the last storm. This is an unacceptable cycle given that our chronic locations flood in fairly regular rainstorms.  How can we mitigate these events and how can we better prepare for emergencies?  DEP has presented Cloudburst Management and Rainfall Ready programs to CB14's Community Environment Committee. CB14 supports DPR's Lakeshore project. However, these are projects on the horizon. What can be done in the short term to alleviate the loss of property and closure of businesses when combined sewer systems flood from below while the street's overflow from above. Programs to compel DEP to offset the cost of backflow valve installations and zoning text amendments that promise flood mitigation are promising. Raingarden and other green infrastructure programs must be expedited.   Sanitation complaints are brought to our attention daily.  Every time we bring a matter to the attention of BK14 we get immediate response. We could not ask for better community partners. Yet, the demand and pace are difficult to meet.  CD14 also has 54 dead end streets, 3 BIDs and 5 additional commercial streets within our 2.9 square miles, which require specific DSNY services such as MLP and basket service. The district is dense with old growth trees, which becomes added work for brooms during leaf season. The resources for composting don't seem to be adequate at this early stage. The department will not attract participation if it cannot adequately service early adapters. Compost trucks should be assigned by service, not weights. Increasingly routes are not finished and a 4x12 truck is required to finish collection. MLP, which was completely eliminated, must be fully restored. TNT is a welcome addition but does not replace critical MLP. There are 54 dead ends in CD14 and MLP is the only program that cleans them. Commercial basket collection must be locked in to 7 days a week. It is hard to know what the winter will bring, but outdoor dining will certainly offer snowplow challenges.  The department seems to be increasingly reliant on councilmember funding, which only reaches the parts of the District served by that member.  CD14 intersects with four councilmembers so baseline services should come from the baseline budget in order to ensure that the district is served equitably. ","Flooding remains an issue in several locations. DEP has assisted Parks to maintain catch basins north of one of our chronic locations along E. 10th Street and Church Avenue, but flooding continues.  Ultimately, the overwhelmed system in the city streets is under the purview of DEP and they must address this issue. Bioswales, permeable surfaces, and catchbasin and roadway maintenance are interagency concerns. This makes it all the more difficullt to coordiante a response. Trench restoration continues to be an issue in the District. In 2019 DOT was allocated $60 million to address trench issues citywide, thus DEP was able to pass the ball on these projects.  However, not one of the trenches in CD 14 made the DOT list. There has been no progress on this issue. DOT has indicated that it has not begun a single project with the original $60 million and there have been no further allocations, which indicates a complete policy failure. ","The city's drastic cuts to DSNY's budget during the pandemic amounted to an effictive 60% reduction in service Citywide. This was the most noticible negative impact of all agency budget cuts and it seems we are still experiencing the impacts. This is the beauty of DSNY - fund it and it will get done. Currently there is still no baseline MLP.  Each and every resident produces more than two pounds of garbage every day. What can we do to change the culture so that people don't think it is OK to litter, leave their dog waste behind or carry their household trash to a corner basket?  The efforts of the Department of Sanitation workers at BK 14 to keep pace with the needs of our District are greatly appreciated but can't keep pace with these actions around the clock. Within our 2.9 miles there are 89 road miles and 54 dead ends and several narrow streets. The introduction of compost was long awaited positive news but the roll out hasn't be smooth as DSNY has not communicated new sets of rules clearly and extra trucks in the community have a downside. A growing number of routes are not collected on shift adding trucks to the afternoon and midnight trucks. Yet, DSNY has just informed us that they are cutting back on presentations to community boards to save money? We believe that the investment in communication, transparency and education will pay off when compared to extra colletion shifts!  We continued to be concerned that bike lanes, pedestrian islands, neckdowns, and Open Streets restaurants, installed and managed by DOT offer new challenges to collection, recycling, street sweeping and snow removal. Illegal  drop offs and dumping continues to be a persistant issue in the district. Cleanliness had improved and complaints had abated along commercial streets when the six day a week basket truck was restored. We support the return of electronics collection and leaf collection programs.  We appreciate and support additional DSNY services to collect Christmas trees and Chometz alike. Many in the district were eager for household organics recycling, and we hope implementation will smooth out. We are extremely grateful for BK14's responsiveness to the needs of our community in general and thier interagency work pertinent to storm clean up, homeless encampment conditions, and derelict vehicles that are persistent issues in several locations in the district. ","","","","","Affordable housing preservation","","Housing code enforcement and building code enforcement are equally important in the district. Only 40% of renter occupied homes are adequately maintained by landlords. CB14 ranks 12th (up from 18th) of 59 community districts in the number of reported serious housing code violations.  Housing code violations are correlated with health issues and is a problem underscored by the fact that the district is also one of the most severely rent burdened and overcrowded. Building new affordable housing with no substantial support to ensure that current inventory is maintained is folly. The ratio of newly built affordable housing to market rate housing has decreased, even as numbers have increased. Landlords are able to secure DOB permits to upgrade and upsell units in buildings where outstanding HPD violations exist. Why? Given the fact that over 48% of the area of the district is comprised of 1-2 family homes, combined with the fact that we rank 15th in the city in terms of population density, the renters of multi-family dwellings are highly concentrated. Their dwellings should be safe, healthy and maintained.   There is a contrast between owners and renters. The median income of homeowners in CD14 is $126,740. The median income of renters is $57,740. In CD 14, the median price of a single-family home rose from $965K in 2010 to $1,295,000 in 2022. Prospect Park South, Ditmas Park, Midwood Park-Fiske Terrace, Albermarle-Kenmore Terraces, are all historically landmarked neighborhoods.  They comprise 6% of lots in the district, ranking CD14 18th in the City for lots regulated by the Landmarks Preservation Commission. There is also a special permit district in the southern end of the district, which permits an increase the floor area ratio of single family homes.   Communities should not have to forfeit historic contextual development in order to add to much needed affordable housing stock.  It is important to protect the uniquely beautiful, valuable, and significant history of our one- and two-family residential areas while balancing the quality of affordable multi-unit dwellings. ","Community Board 14 residents live in a mix of housing.  Land use is dominated by single and two family homes. Yet our homeownership rate is 24.6%, which ranks CD14 at 35th out of 59 districts citywide.  There are five historic districts in CD 14. The capacity to develop in the district is one of the lowest in the city, yet in 2019 DOB issued 706 permits for new residentail units, and in 2020 despite the construction slow-down over 400 more were issued.  This was up from 359 in 2018 and, the ranking CD 14 the 18th highest among the city's 59 community districts. From 2000-2010 900 units of housing were issued cerfificates of occupancy.  From 2010-2020 that number jumped to 2863. Eighty three precent were market rate and only 10% were low income.  There is no doubt that the pressures for affordable housing are great. We rank 7th in the city in the severe overcrowding rate. In addition, the district is disproportionately rent burdened, with 50% of low-income renter households severely burdened, meaning that rent is at least 50% of household income. Our share of affordable housing is shrinking.  Only 3.9% of units were affordable at 30% of AMI in 2019; down from 4.9% in 2010.  There was also a fall in the percentage of units affordable at 80% of AMI in that timespan: from 70% to 57%.  Only at 120% of AMI did we hold steady at about 98%. This is why people tend to ask, ""...affordable for whom?"" CB14 ranks second in the city in the number of serious housing code violations. In 2021, approximately 181.5 out of every 1000 units had a serious housing code violation; up from 154 in 2020. This is clearly going in the wrong direction. The social determinates of health, including clean, safe and well maintained housing accounts for 80-90% of community health outcomes.  Building new affordable housing is folly if there are no effective efforts to preserve the current stock of affordable units! ","The District ranks 7th in the rate of severe overcrowding in renter households.  The rate of severly rent overburdened households has grown from 28.2% in 2000, to 29.7 in 2010 to 32.5% in 2019!  These are households spending 50% or more of their income on gross rent.  For low income households the rate has increased from 42% in 2010 to 47% in 2019.  This is a harrowing trend given that between being rent burdened and overcrowded contributes to homelessness. Addressing violations, and providing preventative support services, as well as adding affordable housing to the housing inventory must occur simultaneously and urgently. While numbers of housing units have increased, the ratio of affordable housing has decreased.   In 2020 CD14 was 53rd of 59 districts in terms of unused capacity for development. Yet the ranking for units authorized for new building permits soared from 59th in 2000 to 18th in 2019-20.  Units issued new certificates of occupancy went form 53rd citywide to 12th in the same period.  While those number slowed in the following year, those residents are now members of our population and add to the demand for quality public infrastructure and city services.  It is important to understand where the units are being developed vis a vis our public infrastructure in terms of schools, parks, transportation and water and sewer systems; and to ascertain the extent to which affordability of newly developed housing corresponds to the needs of our current residents. ","There are several commercial strips in the district serving the needs of residents and attracting commerce from other parts of the city as well as tourism. Many small independent stores line Church Avenue, Cortelyou Road, Avenues J and M and Coney Island Avenue, Flatbush Avenue and Newkirk Plaza. There are two Business Improvement Districts covering three corridors: Flatbush Nostrand Junction, Flatbush and Church Avenue - and three merchant associations in our community. We face notable challenges in maximizing commercial activity throughout the District.  Triangle Junction shopping mall still has Target as it's anchor store but many other national chains have come and gone, suggesting that there are questions about the fate of this development. The City continues to refuse to assign Newkirk Plaza to DOT or an appropriate agency to allow enforcement, services, and programming for economic development.  The Kings Theatre, a 3300 seat live performance venue, which was a $90 million economic development investment now must manage with the placement of a 200 bed homeless shelter practically on its loading dock.  The theater was to provide a vital link in Brooklyn's cultural corridor and offer spillover opportunities for surrounding merchants.  They must be well supported to spur economic activity. CB14 was awarded a Planning Fellow from the Fund for the City of New York in 2020 who was able to research our past and current economic development opportunities.  This is useful information for as a benchmark for an economic recovery from unprecedentd circumstances. The landmarked Sears store has liquidated, making way for development opportunity but creating a lot of concern given that only as of right market rate housing is planned. ","","","","","Traffic safety and enforcement (cars, scooters, ebikes, etc.)","","Year after year the Department of Transportation has the greatest number of outstanding service delivery requests in the CD14.  This is due to the sheer number of requests combined with the length of time it takes DOT to address service delivery items. It can take years for DOT to address requests for speed reducers, signs, traffic lights, street lights, etc. It is increasingly difficult to get DOT to repair street infrastructure. Often, DOT denies responsibility for assets they used to maintain such as dead end infrastructure; or for their own installations. High weeds on the pedestrian islands at Avenue O and N and at Ocean and Church Avenues block safe sight lines yet, DOT claims no responsibility for maintenance. DSNY has begun to address several DOT assets. There are 54 dead ends in CD 14, most abut railway or subway tracks and need to be walled off in some way for safety.  If DOT is not responsible for maintenance, then who?  As DOT's portfolio grows to include Open Streets for restaurants, Citibike expansion, electric vehicle charging stations, reserved car share parking, while expanding express bus lanes and the bike lane network, it is unclear how competing uses will be prioritized.  The streets surrounding the 70th Precinct are extremely problematic. These narrow streets are so congested that NYPD has determined that they cannot build a new precinct house on site. DOT committed to review the area and present options by the end of the summer of 2022 but has not met that deadline.   The Caton Avenue truck route is used as a through route although it is designated as a local route on the DOT truck route map. It is nearly always congested. Church Avenue, which is technically the through route, according to the DOT truck route map, is congested and includes an express bus lane for several streets. Given DOT’s BQE detour plans and a lack of truck signage and enforcement, safety issues are becoming extreme, especially where Citibike stations requires riders to step into the truck route on Caton Ave.   Road bridges are a concern. The Beverly Road bridge was partially repaired to allow parking and local truck traffic, but there is no timeframe for remaining repairs. The Parkside bridge is prioritized for capital repair, yet we have no timeframe for this work either and the Newkirk Avenue bridge cannot be added to a component contract because Newkirk Plaza has not been assigned to the purview of a city agency.  DOT initiates proposals for bike paths, pedestrian islands, and pedestrian plazas. While gathering local input is time-consuming and often messy, the end result is inevitably better when there is stakeholder buy in. DOT's agreement to move a Citibike station after just a few months in evidence that valuing local input in the first place would have been more efficient. It is important for local voices to be heard at the inception of a plan, not after DOT has completed proposals without local insight. ","All types of transportation are important in District 14. Within the 2.9 miles that comprise the District, there are 89.2 road miles, 54 dead end streets, two through truck routes, several road bridges over the Brighton Line and Atlantic RR tracks and approximately 1200 street segments. Given its Central Brooklyn location and number of thoroughfares in the District including Flatbush Avenue, Coney Island Avenue, Ocean Parkway, Nostrand Avenue running north/south; and Church Avenue, Cortelyou Road, Foster Avenue and Avenues J and M going east/west, traffic and road conditions are constant concerns. Car free commuting has dropped from 74% in 2010 to 62% currently, all while NYCT and DOT strive to increase ridership on mass transit.   Community Board 14 service delivery data show that DOT requests outnumber those of any other agency with which the Community Board interacts. Part of the reason for this accumulation is the time-lag for many DOT issue responses. Responsiveness and community input are important. Of great concern is that there is no way to ascertain an overview of DOT traffic calming measures. CB14 processes hundreds of DOT service delivery requests, but there is no way to understand how implementation of all or any combination of these requests would impact traffic flow in the district. Rather, such requests are considered only insofar as they impact the block for which they are requested. DOT acknowledges that studies are infrequent and that cost-benefit analyses are not standard. There are nine subway stations, seven of which are Brighton Line outdoor tracks, therefore track work affects road traffic. There are also 15 bus lines that operate in the district including express buses and select bus service routes.  CB14 has adovated for the return of the B23 but now the bus redesign anticipates removing all buses from commercial Cortelyou Road and using residential Beverley Road.   New York City must recognize ownership of Newkirk Plaza. The clearest solution we see is for the Plaza to become a formal participant in the DOT's Pedestrian Plaza Program. The City's inability to determine jurisdiction over Newkirk Plaza has left several chronic issues unresolved, including a serious rodent infestation, sanitation maintenance concerns, disrepair of the brick plaza surface, and growing street homelessness challenges.  The New York City Police Department, the Department of Sanitation, the Department of Buildings, and the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, have all been called upon to deal with myriad issues on the Plaza.  Many community stakeholders, including business owners, civic and community-based organizations, and local government entities, continue to struggle to meet these challenges with little support and no permanent resolution in sight and merchants on America's first-ever outdoor shopping plaza have been left to rattle their gates to scare away hordes of rats in the morning and clean human excrement and broken beer bottles from the pedestrian paths leading to their stores. In the recent past, DOT provided FDC with minimal, finite funding to support limited sanitation services, painted the corrugated wall (which is their responsibility anyway) and offered but did not follow through on adding the Plaza to the SAPO system.  None of these steps resolved the longstanding concerns. Once added to the program, the plaza would be transformed into a vibrant, social public space, as per DOT's Plaza Program stated mission.  The lack of clarity around governance of this public space is a detriment to the ability for businesses and community groups to provide additional programming for the community that could also serve as an economic development catalyst..   ","There are nine subway stations in the District: one Culver Line IND stop; one IRT terminal stop and the reminder Brighton Line BMT stops. Most of the Brighton Line stations have been updated - some in full, others partial renovations. However the Church Avenue station is in serious need up rehabilitation. A public private partnership to install an elevator and make this heavily utilzed station ADA compliant is very welcome. Additonal improvements should be included to limit ridership inconvenice during upgrade work. We look forward to accessbility improvments and hope they will expand to the Culver line.  We have asked MTA NYCT to provide us with station capacity data to take into consideration when new developments are proposed so that we can better predict the impact on local transit.  This is especially urgent at the Cortelyou Road station. CB 14 will work to maximize community input on MTA's Fast Forward Brooklyn Bus Network Redesign. This community has long advocated for the restoraton of the B23 on Cortelyou Road but instead the plan currently considers removing all buses (which now only include express lines) from commercial Cortelyou Road and redirecting them to residential Beverley Road. One of the stated reasons is that the right turn from westbound Cortelyou to northbound Coney Island Avenue has been made more difficult to navigate due to DOT installations. There needs to be forward thinking coordination so that plans do not chase after unintended consequences.   The community garden on the exterior side of the Church Avenue Brighton Line station house continues to be a positive addition to the community and should serve as a model for use of the commons.  It is unfortunate that Transit will not take the same creative initiative with Newkirk Plaza.  The East 15th Street MTA house once issued an RFP for development but is now once again back in the hands of MTA and is once again a fallow lot and an eyesore. This property should be RFPed again, or offered an MOU for a garden or operationalized and maintined.  ","","","","","Community board resources (offices, staff, and equipment)","","The Community Board is instrumental in ensuring that cultural and park programming, and facilities; community facility access and programming; forestry services; library facilities and services; parks access, care and maintenance; park safety; quality library programming and other parks, cultural and other community facilities are accessible to the public and maintained by the appropriate agencies.  Community service delivery requests for sanitation, abandoned vehicles, constructions complaints, homeless encampments, fallen tree branches, requests for public health, safety and voting information and so many other requests have increased or changed in nature in the wake of the pandemic. The many needs we have identified in previous years that remain unfunded only served to underscore inequities in our district.  Our return to a healthy, vibrant, and economically sound community depends now, more than ever, on getting services and support to the local community level. That is our role; that is where we are expert.   While the number of service delivery requests have increased, the number of proposals to consider have increased, the number of meetings and events continue to increase, training requirements and new mandates have increased, community board funding has not. Community Boards are one of the few city agencies that have not significantly expanded budget  since 2016 or headcount ever.  Community Board 14 is 59th out of 59 community districts citywide in terms of the number of residents who live more than a quarter of a mile away from a park.  New open space upgraded, and well-maintained current parks and playgrounds are high priorities.   The Flatbush African Burial Ground must be developed appropriately and with the descendant community’s input at the forefront. Rigorous outreach to maximize inclusion is needed to ensure that stakeholders are identified and expanded and provided every opportunity to be heard.   Our libraries are needed more than ever.  The pivot in services that they provided during the pandemic demonstrated the value that they have in our community.  We urge the city to reimagine the design of libraries to increase resiliency and maintain access in response to public health emergencies.    ","Residents of CD 14 live further away from a park than any other District in the entire City of New York, with over 70% living a quarter mile away or more. The largest park in our district is the Parade Ground at our northern border, which includes 40 acres of athletic fields, and tennis courts available primarily by permit. Areas that offer open access such as the Det. Dillon Stewart playground and the adult fitness area, are heavily utilized.  Kolbert Park is in the southern end of the District and the Deputy Inspector Joseph DiGilio Playground is in the west. Umma Park is a small playground over the BMT tracks in the northeastern end of the District, which has antiquated play equipment and no greenery. There are also two tot lots in the District - on Cortelyou Road and on Campus Road. The Department itself must be adequately resourced to maintain its own inventory, instead of relying on funding provided by elected officials. While Umma Park has finally received funding through Councilmember Rita Joseph's office, it was a long time coming.  It's hard to believe that Parks would have delayed so long if the Department held the pocket book. The identification of additional space for parkland and additional greening of green streets areas is essential in our park-poor community.  In 2017 a Planning Fellow provided by the Fund for the City of New York researched and provided recommendations for greening CD14. The urgency of the need for outdoor space was highlighted when social distancing orders were enacted and CD 14 had fewer outdoor options for recreation and public health needs.    The Flatbush African Burial Ground will be constructed as a memorial through the Department of Parks and Recreation.  Funding has been identified for what seems to be preliminary work.  CB14 highly prioritizes funding that is adequate to fully realize a vision of this important, sacred and historic site that is informed by ongoing community engagement.  This is a high priority for our community. ","As we continue to rebound from the economic impacts of the Covid 19 pandemic, the cultural institutions in our community will need focussed support.  Performing arts venues create social capital and economic spillover effects. Situated at the approximate center of Flatbush Avenue, the Kings Theatre serves as a cultural fulcrum of Brooklyn's Cultural Corridor. It has sponsored and supported myriad community events. However, it has been recently embatteled by a poorly run men's shelter located adjacent to a supportive housing facility and abutting the theater's loading dock. The challenges of attracting acts and audiences continue to increase.  Libraries in the district are highly utilized by the community for both traditional and increasingly creative cultural and social service offerings. Support for programming and ensuring state of the art facilities are investments in the community both for immediate and long term needs.  ","District 14's four existing branch libraries are heavily used and highly valued by the community. The Board continues to strongly support essential improvements needed at these locations and advocated for keeping libraries open seven days a week. Our local branch libraries provide programs and services that relate in important ways to our communities such as the Caribbean Literacy and Cultural Center at the Flatbush Branch, and the Cortelyou Road library's teamwork with other community groups. It is important to ensure that libraries are maintained to maximize healthy access. Community members have urged expanding library space at the Cortelyou branch and adding outdoor space at the Flatbush branch. ","CB 14 staff address hundreds of service delivery requests annually. We organize an annual youth conference and nonprofit roundtable. Increasing responsibilities have been assigned and hiring staff and specialists, such as planners, policy analysts, IT assistance, would help to introduce more initiatives and develop longer range projects. Ultimately, we could better complement a complaint driven role with more proactive, grass roots plans. Technology and consultant needs, as we shift out of virtual-only meetings has been and will continue to be a significant expense. Rules as well and the Board's wish to expand language access is hampered by city support and budgetary constraints.  As the most local city agency, we give voice to the individuals who make up our communities. Every city agency has had a budget expansion over the last decade.  Community Boards have not had one in over 20 years. The recent health and resulting budget crisis make it harder for city agencies to reach the most local levels and communities are all the more frustrated. We are their liaison and our role more important than ever. ","","","","","The Department of City Planning and the Office of Management and Budget must expedite improvement of this District Needs and Budget Requests process and platform. The portal was designed with no community board input and the process of prioritizing needs across all city agencies and selecting needs from drop down menus creates inauthentic data. Community Boards are the most local level of government. We serve as the fulcrum between our respective communities and all city agencies.  New York City is a city of neighborhoods and citywide policies and plans are improved by local input from the wide variety of communities. District Managers are the liaison between our communities and all city agencies. We represent our board to residents, merchants, organizations, agencies, the offices of elected officials and more. Our collective experience, perspectives, insights, and institutional memory should be valued at the onset of any city efforts to improve local input. This exercise and the resulting document do not reflect that, nor has it delivered on a more meaningful response from city agencies. Charts from direct community input have been attached to the first budget request in each category because this is the only place that the form allowed. The first page should be a letter from each Boards' Chair not the director of DCP! Our first words should not appear on page four! The PDF/print version of the document does not read paragraph breaks and last year DCP did not publish specific budget needs narratives. Let's do better.

The community district is bordered to the north by the Kings Highway commercial corridor, to the west by the industrial area of McDonald Avenue, to the south by the beachfront community of Manhattan Beach and to the east by the coastal community of Gerritsen Beach. Other residential areas include the neighborhoods of Gravesend, Homecrest, Madison, Midwood and Plumb Beach. It is the policy of CB15 to attend to the needs of our local residents and ensure they are given not only a voice, but also receive timely, quality and efficient delivery of municipal services. Ongoing dialogue between our residents and the community board is an essential part of maintaining public safety and encouraging development and prosperity for all.  According to the Department of City Planning, the total land area of CB15 is 4.7 square miles. Population statistics supplied by New York City Planning's Census 2020 Data reports the overall population of CB15 is 169,632 of which 36,851 (21.7%) are under the age of 18. Racially, the community district breaks down as follows: Hispanic 15,688 (9.2%), White 105,734 (62.3%), Black 6,649 (3.9%), Asian 34,358 (20.3%), Other/Non-Hispanic 1,296 (0.8%) and Multi-Racial 5,907 (3.5%). In terms of Housing Occupancy, the community district includes 67,322 total housing units of which 63,097 (93.7%) are occupied and 4,225 (6.3%) are vacant. ","","","","","Crime and Public Safety","","Staffing levels at our local precinct are down and are of a great concern to our community. We attribute the shortage to a few significant factors, their inability to fill positions trickled down from an attrition of those retiring from the force, and the department's struggle to attract qualified candidates to pursue careers in law enforcement. It is critically important to our community that patrol strength be restored. Resources are needed for recruitment, updated vehicles and capital funding to modernize precincts and make them fully ADA compliant to better serve everyone. We are experiencing spikes in crimes across the board which we attribute to a diminished police presence in our communities. Fewer incoming police officers translates to a drop in uniform strength. We cannot allow that to happen. We must fund a campaign to recruit and retain qualified police officers.","Traffic","","Traffic: All of our commercial corridors, including Sheepshead Bay Road (between East 14th Street and Emmons Avenue) and Avenue U (between Gerritsen Avenue and McDonald Avenue), are congested from double parking, truck deliveries, illegal parking and the never-ending search for parking spaces. Coney Island Avenue (between Avenue P and Guider Avenue) is inundated with double parked cars, people making illegal U-turns and auto-intensive commercial uses which encroach on the roadway. Most of these avenues are also major transit hubs attracting more and more TLC vehicles which usurp parking spaces. Dedicated bus lanes have been implemented, but drivers do not seem to pay much attention to such changes, so they are not working as intended. We need effective Traffic Enforcement, enhanced Police attention and an active and ongoing dialogue with DOT to develop strategies to keep the traffic flowing through these congested areas. Because parking is at a premium, the most frequent 311 reports in our community district include complaints of illegal parking and blocked driveways of constituents who are desperate to park. Response times are lengthy because these complaints are not emergencies. We could use a dedicated unit to focus on these traffic infractions affecting the community's quality of life. Lastly, there is an issue throughout the community with people illegally selling cars on our streets. In Sheepshead Bay (around Jerome Avenue and Avenue Z), and in Gravesend (along McDonald Avenue between Avenue V and Avenue X) these pop-up car dealerships on our streets are illegally usurping much-needed parking spaces.","Trash removal and cleanliness","","Trash: The Department of Sanitation needs more personnel, particularly in Sanitation Enforcement. This additional manpower is essential to assure that collections and enforcement divisions have sufficient resources to properly service our district. Our bustling commercial corridors no longer have the maintenance resources or enforcement presence they require to keep our shopping areas thriving, vital, clean and healthy for our constituents and visitors to the district. On any given day, Sheepshead Bay Road (between East 14th Street and Emmons Avenue), Avenue U (between Ocean Avenue and Ocean Parkway), and Coney Island Avenue (between Avenue Z and Avenue P) have overflowing litter baskets from improper uses such as household trash, illegal commercial waste and the illegal dumping of construction materials, as well as trash and loose litter strewn along the streets. Our district office is inundated with complaints about filthy and uninviting conditions on our commercial corridors. We continue to have a serious problem with illegal dumping under the underpasses of our elevated B/Q train lines along East 16th Street and F train line along McDonald Avenue, as well as our Shore Parkway service road which runs parallel to the Belt Parkway between Knapp Street and Coney Island Avenue.   More special events, convenient drop-off locations and dedicated curbside collections for e-waste, hazardous household waste, paper shredding, leaf/yard waste, food scraps, etc. will increase the likelihood of discarded waste being properly disposed of. Smaller vehicles and equipment are needed to service the Gerritsen Beach neighborhood in our district which is characterized by narrower streets. And even after more than a decade BK15 still lacks a proper district garage while our personnel continues to report to inadequate temporary trailers that offer substandard work conditions as morale and productivity suffer.","","","","","Animal and pest control services","","Conditions necessitating pest control services are at an all-time high. The changing landscape of our post-pandemic city has left us with an abundance of outdoor eating establishments which provide shelter and food to rodents and other vectors. With the city intent on maintaining outdoor eating as a new standard, more resources and attention must be paid to their maintenance and ongoing use including preventive and reactive pest control services. New construction in the district, which is generally above average for the borough, has also led to the disruption of rodents en masse forcing them to search for new places to nest. Between the new construction generating more household waste for collection and the increase in nightlife and street activity, the availability of garbage placed out for collection on our sidewalks has provided a veritable feast for rodents which show no sign of subsiding anytime soon. In addition, the new rules for the collection of compostable trash have us concerned.","Valuable time is wasted transporting critical patients to other distant trauma centers when we could be planning one for our community right now. Planning a new Level 1 Trauma Center for Coney Island Hospital at this time is imperative. ","Many of our seniors, live in isolation with family members living out of state. They have come to rely more than ever on home delivered meals. Having that brief interaction can be a life saver. Meal providers are trained to check up on seniors and when they are not responding critical steps are than taken to assure our older New Yorkers are doing well. Capacity for meals along with new replacement fleet vehicles should be expanded at this time. ","New York City is facing a homeless epidemic. With affordable housing becoming more of a rarity in the city many are priced out of their homes. Community Board 15 has seen an influx of homeless in the community and believes there should be more outreach from the Department of Homeless Services to actively seek to permanently shelter the displaced and bring them the social programs they need, such as drug rehabilitation, mental illness counseling and job skills training with placement. We have concentrations of people living under the Sheepshead Bay subway station (at East 15th Street), adjacent to the municipal parking lot at 1602 Voorhies Avenue (at East 16th Street), in Holocaust Park (at Shore Boulevard), at the Ocean Avenue & Shore Parkway underpass, at the municipal parking lot at 2602 East 17th Street (at Avenue Z), and at the Corporal Wiltshire Square triangle park (at Kings Highway and Ocean Avenue). It should be noted that some of these locations are seasonal in nature. ","Living in New York has become a costly affair. Rents are rising each year and the cost of living increases exponentially. Salaries don't appear to keep up with the rent demands. Our seniors and disabled are on fixed incomes and struggle to pay rent. We need a way to keep our lower income residents safely in their homes and off the streets with some sort of voucher system to aide them. Hotels and shelters aren't permanent housing, they often prove to be a temporary fix and in the long run are not cost efficient. The existing rental assistance programs, such as Section 8, which need better policing are over-saturated and closed. ","","","","","After school programs","","After school programs provide a safe, social and educational experience for our children, while giving them the tools they will need to develop into successful motivated adults. It's important we make sure there is proper funding in place to maintain and expand these important programs.","Brooklyn has grown in population at an alarming rate and our school systems have not caught up with the demands. We have several schools in the district that are overcrowded and resources are stretched to the seams. We need to take a good hard look at these schools and seek solutions to either expand classrooms when possible or create a new school to accommodate these very real and growing needs. Our children are our future and they deserve the best education possible and overcrowded classrooms cannot provide that. PS 254, PS 153 and PS 206 are prime examples of schools at capacity. ","After school programs provide a safe, social and educational experience for our children, while giving them the tools they will need to develop into successful motivated adults. It's important we make sure there is proper funding in place to maintain and expand these important programs.ments ","","","","","General crime","","Our community has been plagued with increased incidents ranging from violent unprovoked attacks preying on our elderly, to burglaries and a variety of quality of life infractions, like illegal parking, illegal fireworks and excessive noise. We need increased police presence through a combination of increasing patrol strength and enhancing police visibility. ","With the community district being nearly five square miles in area there is an immediate need for additional police officers to provide sufficient patrol coverage. The 61st Precinct is understaffed and many of our officers are pulled away and reassigned to work the seasonal tour at the 60th Precinct or larger events throughout the city. Brooklyn Community Board 15 has received numerous complaints on how response times to low priority events, such as car break-ins or non-fatal traffic crashes, have suffered. We attribute this to diminished staffing levels. Another example of a frustrating low priority event are complaints from homeowners about blocked driveways from drivers losing patience hunting for legal on-street parking. We also have vehicles that are not moved for alternate side street cleaning and vehicles that are either abandoned or being sold on our streets usurping valuable parking real estate. The Police Department's Rotational Towing (Row Tow) capabilities are limited in that they have insufficient space to store vehicles. There is only one Tow Pound located across the borough in Northern Brooklyn and the time it takes to tow across the borough limits how many vehicles they can capture in a work shift. Something needs to change. Either fines need to be increased on an escalating scale as a more effective deterrent, or the capacity at the existing Tow Pound needs to be expanding with the addition of car lifts (stackers), or an entirely new tow pound facility be created in Southern Brooklyn to expand the department's holding capacity and reduce the turnaround time for Row Tow operators. ","Currently, our EMS training facility is too small and insufficent to accomodate and train a larger sized class. We need to find a larger location, that is more modernized to adequately recruit, train and retain our EMS personnel/ ","","","","","Cleanliness/trash collection","","We need to make sure our Sanitation Department is fully funded. We are seeing an influx of complaints in our district office from residents regarding filthy sidewalks, illegal dumping, overflowing litter baskets and unsanitary conditions. DSNY is doing all they can do with the manpower and equipment they have, but it's impossible to keep up with the increasing demands. We need to provide them with the manpower they require, the vehicles and tools needed to see that our community remain clean, viable places to live, shop, work and visit. Above all, we need a new garage for BK15.","The Coney Island Wastewater Treatment Plant located at 3002 Knapp Street is in need of an increase in overall plant budget for on-going maintenance of the water treatment plant. We need funding for force main repair and additional funding for odor control equipment for repairs and improvements. We would also like a dedicated skimmer vessel for Sheepshead Bay to address floatables due to two CSO outfalls located in Sheepshead Bay and Gerritsen Beach. ","Our main concern is that our Department of Sanitation's Brooklyn 15 garage has been operating out of a temporary location on Knapp Street in trailers for over a decade. Recently, we have learned that the secondary lot used by Sanitation for equipment storage has been reclaimed by the Department of Environmental Protection. Our Sanitation forces and equipment need a permanent home in our community district. Brooklyn Community Board 15 is also advocating for additional funding for our Sanitation Department. We need more manpower, more frequent litter basket service, cleaning services to address illegal drop-off and dump out conditions, vacant lot cleaning and curbside e-waste collection. ","","","","","Affordable housing preservation","","Our community is a naturally occurring retirement community (NORC) with many of our seniors aging in place. With fixed incomes and insufficient cost of living increases to their social security, aging in place has become increasingly challenging in Brooklyn with the rising costs of rent and other living expenses. We need programs which provide assistance to our seniors, especially those who helped build our communities and want to remain in their homes. If rental assistance is not possible then tax relief to landlords to allow seniors to spend their years with peace of mind securely with a roof over their head.","We are seeing a surge in construction, now that the pandemic is over. We need proper inspections to make sure properties are following suit with their approved plans. We would like to see more inspectors trained and hired to keep up with the influx. ","We have been receiving an influx of calls from NYCHA's Sheepshead-Nostrand Houses located in our district because of unreasonably long waits for repairs--including broken front doors, broken ovens and other appliances, plumbing issues and generally unsanitary living conditions. The maintenance system in public housing is broken, the prolonged waits are unacceptable. Additional on-site maintenance crews are needed to expedite the warrant of habitability. ","We have a large number of small commercial corridors in our district (i.e.; Avenue U, Sheepshead Bay Road, Avenue P, Gravesend Neck Road and Avenue X) with rents sky-rocketing to ludicrous heights. These storefronts either turnover rapidly, or sit vacant warehoused without attracting new businesses or new investment in the community. Empty storefronts don't entice consumers. They reduce foot traffic to the corridors. Things have gone from bad to worse. The City needs to offer indepedent small business owners more incentives and assistance in creating businesses, or offer property owners some incentives to attract and retain businesses. Outrageous rents are keeping many of our small commercial areas bleak and depressed. Small businesses have been shown to be the backbone of a local community's economy. They are worthy of our support. ","","","","","Traffic congestion","","Our community is growing by leaps and bounds and with the amount of new construction, parking has not kept up with the development or demand. Where one house stood, now several apartments stand with families owning several cars.  Because of the lack of parking, people are increasingly parking illegally, they double park and cause congestion throughout the community especially near our commercial districts, such as Sheepshead Bay Road, Avenue U, Kings Highway and Coney Island Avenue. Every school is inundated with parents waiting to pick up their children at dismissal causing congestion throughout the community. We need to develop traffic plans to alleviate the congestion and address the increasing demand for more parking.","Gerritsen Beach is plagued with flooding, even after a minor rainfaill event. The neighborhood received some funding to address the older area, but not Gerritsen Beach in it's entirety. Gerristen Avenue from Bartlett Avenue to the Dead End also needs to be studied and upgraded. Streets must be resurfaced and proper drainage provided. Also throughout our community, the Department of Transportation must assign an additional roadway construction crew to expedite the backlog of approved speed humps which must be installed within a matter of months not years. Trench restorations have emerged as a significant consideration given the ongoing dispute over responsibility between the Departments of Transportation and Environmental Protection. While agencies point fingers at each other, roadways are collapsing. Additional HIQA inspectors are needed to keep up with the growing demand for structural integrity and mainenance inspections related to the new class of outdoor eating facilities that were constructed during the pandemic.  ","Our stations are filthy! They smell like urinals, the staircases are lined with debris and graffiti is everywhere both inside and outside the stations. Illegal vendors can be found outside each of our large commercial shopping districts along the B/Q lines, Sheepshead Bay, Avenue U, and Kings Highway, blocking access to the station and leaving their garbage strewn about. ","","","","","Quality of parks and park facilities","","Our parks serve as an oasis for both young and old to enjoy, but many are in dire need of upgrades. Throughout the district we need more inviting spaces with even pavement, ample seating, good lighting and more modern play equipment to serve all ages and all needs.","Brooklyn Community Board 15's parks are in desperate need of maintenance and upgrades. The Department of Parks & Recreation needs to hire additional staff to meet the maintenance needs our parks require on a daily basis, whether it is trimming the weeds, pruning the trees, collecting garbage or making sure play equipment is safe and functioning. In addition, when planning a park or making upgrades to an existing park, comfort stations need to be made a priority, not an afterthought. Homecrest Park located at Williams Court between East 12th Street and Homecrest Avenue desperately needs a comfort station. It's a well-utilized popular park for both the very young and old and bathroom facilities need to be provided. Brigham Park, located on Emmons Avenue by Brigham Street and Knapp Street, is in a rather remote area. A comfort station must be included.  ","Our community is vibrant and alive yet we are lacking in the arts. Our children need to travel to other communities to enjoy the fine arts. Traveling art shows would enhance the waterfront of Emmons Avenue. We need our area parks to host arts, cultural, recreational and educational events such as science fairs which would allow our youth to experience hands-on projects. We would also like to see funding go to the Percent for Art program that introduces art elements to Capital projects in our district. ","Our libraries are the heartbeats of our community providing invaluable tools and resources to our young and older residents. It's important we properly fund these institutions to keep them current with the times, safe and accesible to all our residents who heavily rely on them as an important community resoure.

According to the 2020 Census, Ocean Hill-Brownsville has a population of 98,506 which is an increase from the 2010 census that recorded the population at 86,468. Approximately 67.4% of the population is Black/African American, 22% of Hispanic Origin, 3.4% White, 1.4% Asian, and 5.8% other. There are 25.1% of households with children under 18 years old, and 19% of the population is age 60 years and older. Many of our residents are disadvantaged from an early age, due to a lack of support and resources in our local schools and lack of access to early intervention services. Our students have some of the lowest attendance rates in the City and the overwhelming majority are not proficient in reading and math. This translates into low graduation rates, leaving many residents in our community unprepared for the job market. More than half of the population receives income support. Unemployment is an acute problem in our community where 12% of the civilian labor force was unemployed on average (DHMH Community Health Profile). The issue is severely impacting our young people, with unemployment rates for 20 to 24 years old at 28 percent. Males are experiencing higher unemployment rates in the district than females, with rates of 19 and 11 percent respectively. Job training and placement programs are needed to combat this problem. High poverty creates a host of other issues related to affordable housing, health, childcare and crime. As we move forward to address the issue of homelessness, permanent housing is needed, not homeless shelters. The housing must be affordable to residents of the community where the median household income is $38,285. According to the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, residents of Ocean Hill-Brownsville experience more barriers to health care access than those in New York City overall, with nearly 3 in 10 without a regular doctor. Many of our residents are not eating healthy meals because they lack the income and access to healthy foods. Heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, obesity, asthma, HIV and AIDS, mental health, and maternal and infant health are prevalent in our community. Gun violence involving young adults is an increasing problem in our community. Unreported crimes and injuries from street justice continue to negatively impact on our district. As a result of COVID-19, low-income neighborhoods and communities of color, such as Ocean Hill-Brownsville,  were disproportionately impacted with coronavirus infections and fatalities. COVID-19 exposed and further exacerbated underlying health disparities that have persisted in our community - disparities which are evident by the prevalence of high rates of preexisting underlying chronic illnesses and socio-economic challenges.  Our community needs financial, health, mental health, and social services support to mitigate the long term effects of COVID-19 on our residents. Many of the obstacles our community face are interrelated and cannot be solved in isolation. In addition to addressing the requests included in our list of priorities, we would like to underscore the need for government agencies at every level to allocate funds for necessary infrastructure and maintenance systems. We need collaboration of both the public and private sectors to address the many issues our community residents have. ","","","","","Affordable Housing","","As the cost of housing continues to increase, residents of Community District #16 are being displaced. Permanent and affordable housing, not homeless shelters, are needed to meet the increasing needs of our senior citizens, families, and single adults with minimum wage jobs.  We also need permanent and affordable housing for young adults whose income is below or above a certain income threshold - too much for subsidized housing but not enough for market rate housing.    The price of a house is unaffordable to many of our residents.  Even with government subsidies, many of our hardworking families find it difficult to attain the American dream of owning their own home because their income has not advanced with the cost of living.  Rental housing costs are also skyrocketing, thus making it difficult for families and single adults to maintain permanent housing.","Health care services","","Ocean Hill-Brownsville is part of the Central Brooklyn community where, according to the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, its residents experience more barriers to health care access than those in New York City overall, with nearly 3 in 10 without a regular doctor.    According to the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene's Community Health Profiles 2018, 28% of Community District #16's residents live below the Federal Poverty level and it is the poorest neighborhood in Brooklyn and the seventh-poorest in neighborhood in New York City. In Community District #16, the rate of preterm births, a key driver of infant death, is the second highest in the city, the teen birth rate of 13.3% is higher than the Brooklyn rate of  6.2% and  the citywide rate of 6.7%.     We need the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene to continue its partnership with the various community-based agencies to stem the tide of maladies that are consuming our community and expand obstetric, pediatric, geriatric,  mental health, HIV and AIDS services, mental health, and maternal and infant health services. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Central Brooklyn has been disproportionately impacted with coronavirus infections and fatalities.  Compared to other neighborhoods in New York City, Ocean Hill-Brownsville is amongst the low-income and communities of color that has been disproportionately impacted by COVID-19.  COVID-19 only exposed and further exacerbated underlying health disparities that have persisted in our community - disparities which are evident by the prevalence of high rates of preexisting underlying chronic illnesses and socio-economic challenges.  Additionally, health care resources are needed to serve the influx of migrants that have moved into the district and which is a growing crisis in New York City.  Our community continues to need financial, health, mental health, and social services support to mitigate the long term effects of COVID-19 on our residents. ","Transit (buses & subways)","","Community District #16 is a transit rich community with no accessible subway stations for persons with physical disabilities in the district. An elevator was recently installed at the Livonia Avenue station on the L-line, however, it is not accessible to Community District #16 residents who are on the west side of Van Sinderen Avenue and must ascend a bridge to cross over train tracks to get to the Livonia Avenue station (The elevator is accessible to residents who are on the east side of Van Sinderen Avenue in CD #5). Public transportation is the only source of transportation for many of our residents who are economically disadvantaged and lack the resources to access alternative modes of transportation to travel outside of the community.  Many of these individuals are single mothers with infants, physically disabled and elderly residents who require an elevator to access the platform.  This lack of compliance with the American Disability Act threatens the quality of life of these vulnerable residents who seek independence.","","","","","Services for low-income and vulnerable New Yorkers","","Poverty is a severe issue facing our community that impacts health and a host of other quality of life measures.  Approximately 34.3% of residents have incomes below the New York City government poverty threshold (2020 Census).  Poverty rates in Community District #16 are particularly severe among families with children where 47 percent are living in poverty.  These rates rise even further for single mothers with children where poverty rates are 51.7 percent.  The poverty rate amongst seniors (65 and over) is 34% (2020 Census). Living in poverty limits healthy lifestyle choices and makes it difficult to access health care and resources that can promote health and prevent illness. According to the Community Health Profile (DHMH), 29% of Brownsville residents live in poverty, compared with 20% of New York City residents.  Access to affordable housing and employment opportunities with fair wages and benefits are also closely associated with good health. Brownsville's unemployment rate is higher than the citywide average of 9%.  Rent burdened households pay more than 30% of their income for housing and may have difficulty affording food, clothing, transportation, and health care. It is imperative that these families receive the much needed income support services such as cash assistance, Medicaid and SNAP benefits; as well as job training and job placement.","Community District #16, which is located in Central Brooklyn and includes the neighborhoods of Ocean Hill and Brownsville, has for many decades been marginalized in receiving much needed health care and wellness services which has perpetuated the inability of local residents in improving their overall health. According to the 2018 Community District Health Profile released by the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, some of these challenges include low income attainment, compromised housing quality, air pollution, preterm births, absenteeism, violence, incarceration, substance abuse, chronic illnesses such as stroke, diabetes, hypertension, HIV and AIDS, and a lack of physical activity and access to healthy foods , and require intervention by New York City and health care institutions. The United States Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion - Healthy People 2020 report lists economic stability as a social determinant of health and the Center for Disease Control (CDC) reports that anti-poverty programs such as the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) help keep children and families above the poverty rate. The main purpose of the EITC is to incentivize people to work while also helping to reduce poverty, and also contributes to positive health outcomes for infants and mothers; and which impacts physical and mental health, infant mortality and low-birth weight rates. Community District #16 has the 2nd highest rate of pre-term births and infant mortality. Furthermore, preventative health care services and outreach increase education and reduce emergency room visits amongst our pediatric, adult and geriatric health care populations in Community District #16. In Central Brooklyn, 3 out of 10 residents are without a regular doctor and many of our residents are underinsured. According to the 2018 Community District Health Profile, approximately 12% of individuals have no health insurance. Other services such as mental health, physical activity and nutrition are important in keeping these residents in the community well. Income, housing, education, violence and access to health care have been adversarial issues in Community District #16 for decades and all are factors of the social determinants of health which continue to impact the lives of our residents. We need the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene to continue its partnership with other levels of government, health care institutions, and the various community-based organizations to expand access to obstetrics and education to promote prenatal care, Lamaze, breastfeeding, and doulas which are positive interventions to maternal and infant health. We need health insurance companies to continue their outreach in the community to enroll individuals and families in health plans. We need assistance for adults who are experiencing financial hardship due to escalating costs of prescription medication. Our senior citizens, in particular, are finding it most difficult to pay out-of-pocket costs for prescriptions. We need nutrition education outreach in the community to identify and assist persons who are not eating properly and are at-risk of becoming obese and developing circulatory and respiratory conditions. We need services to combat these health challenges such as asthma and diabetes which are on the rise in our community. We also need programs to outreach to our adolescents and teenage residents to educate them about reproductive health and services; consequences of engaging in premarital sex, teenage pregnancy prevention, and awareness, safety and services regarding increased cases of human trafficking. It is important that the New York City Department of Health and the Brownsville Neighborhood Health Action Center continue its work and support the residents of Community District #16 to achieve neighborhood health equity. ","According to the American Community Survey, approximately 12% of our population is over the age of 62. A large number of our seniors are low-income, live alone, and reside in public housing for the elderly. For older persons at risk of losing self-sufficiency, senior centers are an entry point to an array of services that will assist them as they age in place. We need continued funding of our senior centers to enable them to offer a wide range of health, education, recreation, volunteer and other social interaction opportunities for their participants that enhance dignity, support independence, and encourage community involvement. Most importantly, the centers provide a social environment conducive to the development of a social support system reducing loneliness and depression. Expansion of the Meals-on-Wheels Program is needed for many of our seniors who live alone and whose income is insufficient to purchase ingredients for nutritional meals. Many of our elderly and infirm adults who live alone need escort services to accompany them to medical appointments and grocery shopping. They also need assistance with personal care, housekeeping, and financial management as they strive to live independently in their own homes. ","Community District #16 is over saturated with homeless housing. There are 12 homeless shelters funded by the Department of Homeless Services, several shelters for victims of domestic violence, and a number of three quarter houses. In addition, rooms are being rented in hotels in our community to house homeless individuals and families from South America who are seeking asylum in the United States. Families and individuals become homeless due to a variety of circumstances, including loss of job, instances of substance abuse, domestic violence, eviction, or unsafe building conditions. Because the shelter system should never be considered a home, programs such as CITYFHEPS and HRA HOME-Tenant-Based Rental Assistance (TBRA) are needed to assist this population to move into permanent housing. Homeless prevention programs such as Homebase are also needed to assist those at risk of losing affordable permanent housing by providing monetary assistance and linking them to needed resources such as job training, childcare, and substance abuse programs. Community-based social service agencies and health care organizations must receive sufficient funding to give individuals and families the long term support that they need. ","According to our district profile published by the Department of City Planning, 29.6% of our residents have incomes below the NYC government poverty threshold. Our low-income and vulnerable residents have less assets and often face major challenges meeting daily living expenses for housing, food, clothing, and health care. It is imperative that resources be provided to this group to enhance their quality of life. Low-income families experience severe hardships whether they rely on cash assistance, work or a combination of both. These families need institutional support in the form of education, financial literacy job training, fair wages, child care, parenting skills, and health care. ","","","","","Youth workforce development and summer youth employment","","According to the 2020 Census, residents under the age of 18 represent 25.1% of Community District #16.  Presently, the unemployment rate in the district is approximately 14% and has been higher at other times.  Youth workforce development is extremely important to the Ocean Hill-Brownsville community where poverty is prevalent and the rate is 34.3%.  During their formative years, youths can benefit a great deal from workforce development programs that help to reinforce classroom learning, offer exposure to new knowledge, technical and social skills, and help youths develop an attitude toward participation, teamwork and productivity.  Summer Youth Employment Programs are early introductions to the world of work and help youth gain valuable work experience with transferrable skills that our youth need to develop good work habits and sustain employment.  By developing good work habits and skills at an early age, our youth are more likely to continue this trend as they progress toward adulthood.","School District #23 has one of the lowest attendance record in the city. We are requesting that the Department of Education provide additional resources to address the truancy problem. The Department of Education should work with community members to determine the root cause of truancy in the district and develop innovative solutions that serve our students before they become truant. Nearly a third of the district's young people (18 to 24 years old) lack a high school diploma or equivalency, 50 percent more than Brooklyn as a whole. Another third have obtained a high school diploma or GED. Only five percent have completed a four year college degree. As New York City's economy becomes increasingly specialized, it is crucial for our residents to be prepared to compete for quality jobs. We are requesting that the New York City Department of Education further its investment in career and technical education and college readiness programs. Our schools will require highly skilled teachers, guidance counselors, and curricula incorporating STEM which will help place students on a college bound educational path. School children also need an environment that is conducive to learning, therefore, we need facility upgrades to our school buildings to support the use of technology and elevators for ADA compliance.To ensure that youth in Community District #16 have the greatest opportunities for a comprehensive education, we also need funding to support civic engagement, financial literacy learning, and music and arts in our schools, and youth programs. It is important that the City of New York and the New York City Department of Education support the educational needs of our young residents in Community District #16 to achieve neighborhood equity in education.. ","According to the 2020 census, 25.1% of the district's population is under 18 years of age. Day care and headstart programs play a crucial role in supporting young children's development, learning and preparation for both school and life success. Early care and education programs foster children's healthy and positive cognitive, physical, social and emotional development. Early childhood education programs are also critical to parental employment stability. A number of grandparents and other relatives find themselves serving as parents for children whose own parents are unable to care for them because of substance abuse or incarceration. Many of these relatives need financial support to provide food, shelter and clothing to these children. Poverty, parental alcoholism, family instability, overcrowding and abusive conditions in the home, incarceration of a parent, or death of a parent render many of our children at-risk of juvenile delinquency. We need programs for at-risk youth and preventive services; i.e., juvenile justice, health education, sports, technology, cultural arts and design, workforce and entrepreneurship. ","","","","","Youth crime","","Youth violence is a growing concern in our community where poverty, family instability and unemployment provide fertile ground for its growth. Gangs are perpetuating youth on youth violence that result in injury and death.  Far too many young lives are lost from street justice. Collateral damage inflicted by gun violence impacts the victim's family, friends and community.","Community District #16 has historically been known as an area of New York City with high rates of crime and incidents of violence. As a result, the New York Police Department and the 73rd Precinct have participated in anti-crime programs such as ""Stop and Frisk"" and ""Operation IMPACT"" to help mitigate incidents of crime and violence to improve overall safety within the community. In the years following the launch of these programs, they were criticized for being divisive and lacking proper supervision for assigned officers who were new police academy graduates. The New York Police Department has taken steps to phase out these programs and return to ""Neighborhood-Based Policing"" with a program known as ""Build the Block"" which is a comprehensive crimefighting strategy that assigns Neighborhood Coordination Officers (NCO) to specific areas of the community for better community engagement with local residents. Community District #16 was a pilot community and has been participating in this program since 2016. In the last several years, the New York Police Department and the 73rd Precinct have reported reduced incidents of crimes and more recently some historic lows. Although crimes are decreasing, we continue to need police presence on our streets, in subways, along commercial corridors, around our schools, and in our New York City Housing Authority buildings to combat incidents of crime, and support the Police Department continuing to connect with the community and building relationships. However, as a result of prior experiences with the Police Department, there are still some unreported incidents of crimes from street justice. In addition, some law-abiding citizens are reluctant to report crimes because they are distrustful of the police and their ability to reduce crimes. Therefore, we are asking that police officers continue to receive frequent training in community engagement, cultural sensitivity and mental health first aid response to incidents of opioid overdose. In addition, we request that police officers be equipped with body cameras for better transparency of incidents of policing.  It is important that the New York City Police Department continue to make improvements in policing that respect the humanity of our residents and visitors, and deploy resources efficiently to achieve neighborhood equity. ","Community District #16 has a large concentration of New York City Housing Authority buildings as well as privately-owned elevated buildings which house many families in close proximity to each other. It is imperative that an adequate number of well trained firefighters are assigned to the firehouses in Community District #16 and they be provided with the necessary firefighting equipment to respond to fires, medical and other emergencies. ","","","","","Cleanliness/trash collection","","We are elated by new housing being built on City-owned as well as privately-owned land which is bringing new families to our community.  We need more Sanitation personnel to pick up garbage and clean our streets.    Because of limited onsite storage, garbage from several of our schools and New York City Housing Authority buildings is placed on the sidewalks daily.  We need daily pick up of this garbage which is unsightly and attracts rodents.    Community District #16 continues to remain at the bottom for recycling.  We need ongoing community outreach to educate our residents about the benefits of recycling.","During heavy rainfall, flooding and ponding conditions are common at a number of heavily trafficked locations throughout the district. We need regular maintenance of our catch basins to remove obstructions and ensure that water continues to flow freely and not create ponding conditions. The Department of Environmental Protection has installed over 300 rain gardens throughout the district to reduce combined sewer overflow discharges into New York City's waterbodies. We encourage these green infrastructure improvements which are intended to reduce flooding, environmental and health impacts; however, because of the dimensions of the rain gardens, they also collect windblown litter, electronics and other illegally dumped debris. Furthermore, when the greenery is not properly maintained and pruned, they obstruct street view and pose a safety concern. We are in need of regular maintenance of our catch basins to remove obstructions and ensure that water continues to flow, and regular pruning and cleaning of rain gardens. We need ongoing community outreach to educate our residents about the benefits of rain gardens and the residents' assistance with maintenance. It is important that the NYC Department of Sanitation and Department of Environmental Protection make service level improvements as a result of these adverse concerns and deploy resources efficiently to achieve neighborhood equity and not overburden area residents.. ","As new housing construction bring new families to the community, we need more Sanitation personnel to pick up garbage and clean our streets. Areas in the vicinity of New York City Housing Authority buildings and schools continue to be problematic because garbage is placed on the sidewalks on a daily basis after the collection truck makes its regular pick up. When this occurs, litter is strewn about the sidewalk and streets. Greater enforcement is needed throughout the district where vehicle owners do not comply with street cleaning regulations.  Mechanical brooms are unable to properly sweep the streets due to illegally parked vehicles.  Illegal dumping in vacant lots and on sidewalks in front of vacant buildings create unsightly, unhealthy and hazardous conditions. We need regular Sanitation patrol of chronic dumping locations to apprehend violators. We also need ongoing community outreach to educate our residents about the benefits of recycling. ","","","","","Affordable housing creation","","Households that pay more than 30% of their income for housing, including utilities are considered cost burdened because they may have difficulty paying non-housing needs such as food, clothing, transportation, child care and medical care.  According to the Community Health Profile 2018 (DHMH), 57% of Community District #16 residents are  rent burdened, a higher rate than residents citywide. Decent housing that is affordable to working and low income families and seniors is in short supply in our community.  As the cost of housing continues to soar and income remains stagnant, residents are being pushed out of their homes and onto the streets.  We need affordable housing  and rent subsidy programs to provide stability for this vulnerable population.","No comments","The availability of quality housing in Community District #16 is continuing to diminish due to the age and condition of our public housing buildings and upgrades needed to keep these units available to low income families.  For residents not residing in public housing, the need for permanent affordable housing, not homeless shelters, continues to be a high priority for our community to meet the increasing needs of our senior citizens, families, and single adults with income that ranges from fixed and/or minimum wage and above, but is not sufficient to afford other housing opportunities.  There is a growing need for affordable housing for young adults whose income is below or above certain thresholds - not enough for market rate housing but too much for subsidized housing.  The lack of availability of these units forces these young adults out of the community and away from their families. The price of a house is unaffordable for many of our residents.  Even with government subsidies, many of our hardworking families find it difficult to attain the American dream of owning their own home because their income has not increased with the cost of living.  Rental housing costs are also skyrocketing, thus making it difficult for families and single adults to maintain permanent housing within New York City or Community District  #16.  We need the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development to provide funding to build truly affordable housing on City-owned land inclusive of a distribution of units that can house our seniors, young adults and families at affordable income levels; and also to the greatest extent possible offer equitable features through mixed use spaces and facilities to replace neighborhood conveniences that have been lost due to the high costs of real estate and taxes, but are needed in order to sustain a good quality of life for residents.  In addition, we need the City to continue providing assistance to residents who are interested in homeownership and/or need to make repairs to their homes to make the homes livable into the foreseeable future.","Since the early 1970s, Ocean Hill-Brownsville has experienced extreme disinvestment along its commercial corridors of Pitkin Avenue, Mother Gaston Boulevard, Saratoga Avenue, Fulton Street, Rockaway Avenue, and Belmont Avenue. The most glaring impact is along Belmont Avenue where there are a number of vacant storefronts or marginal month-to-month tenants. We need both private and public investments in these commercial corridors where our local residents can purchase healthy foods, clothing, furniture, dine out, and engage in cultural enrichment activities. We need the New York City Department of Small Business Services to support our local residents with workforce placements, small business development, and Minority and Women-Owned Business (M/WBE) certifications to address the issues of commercial vacancies, availability of diverse goods and services, and contracting with city agencies. Additionally, we appeal to the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs and Workers Protection to help with small business outreach and education. We need the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development and the New York City Economic Development Corporation to market City-owned parcels and work with private owners who are in need of financial assistance to develop their properties to better serve the community. Given that small businesses are essential to local employment, support from these City agencies will help stimulate investment which will create economic opportunities for local residents and begin to address a persistent and acute problem of unemployment in Community District #16 across all demographics. This issue is severely impacting our young people with unemployment rates for 20-24 years old at 28 percent, compared with 20 percent for Brooklyn. Males in the district are experiencing higher unemployment rates in the district than females, with rates at 19 and 11 percent respectively. In order to achieve neighborhood equity, we call on the City to implement and expand job training and placement programs to combat high unemployment rates and concentrate resources available through the Summer Youth Employment Program, Workforce 1 and other programs that provide workforce development services. Furthermore, making improvements to the district's schools and incorporating Career and Technical Education will also help to address this problem by insuring that our young people are prepared for opportunities in the job market.. ","","","","","Accessibility (ADA related compliance and infrastructure enhancements)","","Community District #16 is a transit rich community with no accessible subway stations for persons with physical disabilities in the district. Public transportation is the only source of transportation for many of our residents who are economically disadvantaged and lack the resources to access alternative modes of transportation to travel outside of the community. Many of these individuals are single mothers with infants, handicapped and elderly residents who require an elevator to access the platform. This lack of compliance with the American Disability Act threatens the quality of life for these vulnerable residents who seek independence. This disparity adds to the amount of time it takes to travel and/or may increase travel costs for these already economically disadvantaged individuals to travel by an alternative mode; i.e., car service. There are 11 elevated and one subterranean (Rockaway Avenue on the ""IND"") train stations that are not accessible to the physically challenged, including Halsey Street, Chauncey Street, and Broadway Junction station on the ""IND"" line, Atlantic Avenue, Sutter Avenue, Livonia Avenue and New Lots Avenue on the ""L"" line, and the Sutter-Rutland Road, Saratoga Avenue, Rockaway Avenue and Junius Street on the ""IRT"" line. We call upon the New York City Metropolitan Transit Authority to appropriate needed funds to install elevator access to stations throughout Community District #16 and construct a connecting passageway between the ""L"" and ""IRT"" lines at Junius Street and Livonia Avenue to enable commuters to freely transfer between stations. The Broadway Junction station has a very high volume of traffic because of its connections to 3 train lines and 5 bus lines. The station has a series of steps that prevent the physically challenged from using this facility. The East New York station on the Long Island Railroad is in need of updating. Cameras are in place on the platforms and should also be placed in the tunnel connecting the stairwells leading to the service roads of Atlantic Avenue, and additional lighting is also needed. Presently, there is no wheelchair access on the westbound platform. We are requesting that a permanent ramp be installed to provide access for wheelchair bound passengers who now must travel to the Atlantic Avenue terminal to disembark. Community District #16 is becoming increasingly denser and there are more people using the subway. Several of our transit stations have multiple entrances that could be used by commuters but are not currently accessible. We are requesting that NYC Transit make these entrances accessible to alleviate commuter congestion at train entrances, increase safety, offer neighborhood conveniences, and add to the quality of life for residents. It is important that these transit improvements are made to comply with federal law and achieve neighborhood safety.","Potholes and depressions continue to imperil traffic in Community District #16.     The Departments of Transportation and Environmental Protection need to jointly inspect locations that frequently depress and eventually cave-in to identify the origin of the roadway condition and repair them in a timely fashion.    A number of our streets are dimly lit and create an atmosphere conducive to criminal activities.  The intensity of street lights need upgrading, especially underneath the elevated train lines along Broadway and Livonia Avenue, and along the bus routes.    Truck traffic is increasing throughout the district.  Residential blocks, instead of designated truck routes, are being used by 18-wheelers which are destroying our streets and creating congestion.  More designated truck route signs are needed.    With new housing construction, the volume of traffic is increasing.  It is imperative that the Department of Transportation conduct a districtwide survey to determine locations for new traffic lights and stop signs.","There are no accessible subway stations for persons with physical disabilities in the district. The Halsey Street, Chauncey Street, Rockaway Avenue and Broadway Junction stations on the ""IND"" line, the Atlantic Avenue, Sutter Avenue, Livonia Avenue, and New Lots Avenue stations on the ""L"" line, and the Sutter Avenue-Rutland Road, Saratoga Avenue, Rockaway Avenue, and Junius Street stations on the ""IRT"" line are not accessible to the physically challenged due to them being subterranean and elevated.. We call upon the Metropolitan Transit Authority to appropriate needed funds to rehabilitate the bridge at Junius Street that enables commuters to connect to the Livonia Avenue station on the ""L"" line. In addition, we request that there be a free transfer between the Junius Street station on the IRT-3 and Livonia Avenue station on the ""L"" line. We also request that the New Lots Avenue station on the ""L"" line be rehabilitated to include new lighting.The Broadway Junction station has a very high volume of traffic because of its connections to 3 train lines and 5 bus lines. The station has a series of steps that prevent the physically challenged from using this facility. We urge the Transit Authority to make the station handicap accessible. The East New York Avenue station on the Long Island Railroad is in need of updating. Cameras are in place on the platforms and should also be placed in the tunnel connecting the stairwells leading to the service roads of Atlantic Avenue. Presently, there is no wheelchair access on the westbound platform. We are requesting that a permanent ramp be installed to provide access for wheelchair bound passengers who now must travel to the Atlantic Avenue terminal to disembark. ","","","","","Quality of parks and park facilities","","Our playgrounds and parks provide the only recreation for many of our residents who are economically disadvantaged and are unable to travel outside of the community.    Several of these parks are located adjacent to public schools where hundreds of children use them on a daily basis during school hours.  We need regular maintenance to keep them clean and prevent their deterioration from normal wear and tear. The Brownsville Recreation Center is an indoor facility that is used on a daily basis by hundreds of patrons.  We are pleased to see that renovation has finally begun at the Brownsville Recreation Center.  ","Community District #16 has 23 parks and playgrounds and 65 community facilities, including the Brownsville Recreation Center, 3 branches of the Brooklyn Public Library, Betsy Head Park and Pool (which is a New York City landmark built during the WPA era), and several other community facilities located throughout our 20 New York City Housing Authority developments. All of these parks, playgrounds, and community facilities serve residents of all ages on a daily basis and must comply with the American Disability Act and be properly maintained and upgraded regularly to ensure that the infrastructure and facilities continue to meet the needs of our residents into the foreseeable future. Our playground, parks, and community facilities provide the only source of recreation for many or our residents who are economically disadvantaged and lack the resources to travel outside of the community to recreation facilities. It is important that these open spaces and community facilities be maintained, upgraded and programmed to achieve neighborhood equity, and respect the cultural sensitivity of the community with regard to sports and other recreation activities that are in high demand in comparison to other communities across New York City with greater income and access. Our playground, parks and community facilities are used by hundreds of residents on a daily basis. They offer much needed recreation facilities for at-risk youths, low-income children and families; and in general improves the overall quality of life for residents which makes the Ocean Hill-Brownsville neighborhood more livable. Several of these parks and playgrounds are located adjacent to public schools and are used by students during school hours. According to research, green spaces, public parks, and recreation facilities have been strongly linked to reductions in crime and in particular reduction in juvenile delinquency. During the summer months, playground assistants are needed to provide structured activities in our playgrounds and parks. Community District #16 has 26 community gardens which are critically important to the historical narrative of the community and provide additional community and open space for residents, and most importantly fresh vegetables and fruits for our residents. Resources and support to maintain community gardens are equally important and much needed. To ensure that all facilities are properly maintained and the greatest amount of community benefit can be derived, additional maintenance and recreation staff are needed in our playground, parks, and community facilities, especially in the Brownsville Recreation Center. ","The Brownsville Multi Services Center, located at 444 Thomas S. Boyland Street, is in need of renovation. There has been no major renovation to this facility since it was built in the 1970s. The bathrooms, elevator, heating and ventilation system, and electrical wiring need upgrading to better service the needs of its occupant agencies that provide an array of services to the general public. We note that a proposal to construct a Girls Empowerment Center at 444 Thomas S. Boyland Street is under review.  We encourage the City of New York to proceed with haste to bring this project to fruition. ","The Saratoga Library Branch and the Stone Avenue Library Branch are in need of interior and exterior repairs to improve the environment for their patrons and staff. The heating and cooling system at the Saratoga Library branch needs upgrading, safety and security enhancements are needed, in addition to new furniture and equipment to better serve the needs of the patrons. New windows, doors, repointing and rehab of the limestone, roof and side entry steps are needed at the Stone Avenue branch library. The plans to renovate the Brownsville Public Library have been approved.  We urge that this much needed renovation begin without further delay.

The geographic district encompasses East New York Avenue from East 98 Street to Utica Avenue, South on Utica Avenue to Clarkson Avenue, West on Clarkson Avneue to Bedford Avenue, South on Bedford Avenue to the Long Island Railroad/Glenwood Road East along the Long Island Railroad to East 98 Street, then North on East 98 Street to East New York Avenue. Community District 17 is a culturally diverse community.  Between 2010 and 2020 there was a 5% increase in our total population. According to the U.S. Census Bureau Population, the 2020 population count in CB 17 was reported to be 162,446: with 78% being Black, 8% Hispanic, 2% Asian, 4% White, 8% Other. The number of residents under 18 is reported to be 31,612, a 19 % decrease from 2010. We believe, the CB 17 community have many undocumented residents who, if counted, would probably increase the total population of the district. ","","","","","Affordable Housing","","The preservation and creation of low to moderate-income affordable housing units in our district are essential for CB 17 residents to enjoy a good quality of life in our city that is more equitable and currently enjoyed by our more affluent neighbors in other New York city communities. Our community is under siege, with luxury buildings being built throughout, causing the current residents to be priced out of our community.  Community Board 17 has 62,636 housing units, with 58,768 occupied units and 3,868 unoccupied. In 2019, Community Board 17 had a homeownership rate of 32.4% compared to 29.8% borough-wide. During the COVID-19 crisis, many foreclosures happened in Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Queens. However, the highest rate of foreclosure filings took place in Community Board 17, with 10.5 per 1,000 1-4 family and condo properties.  Hence, we believe it is necessary to preserve homeownership and encourage access to more first-time homeownership programs like the ones offered by IMPACCT and NHS, which can ultimately help to protect and create more affordable housing.  We are aware that CB 17 is made up of predominantly 1-4 family homes.   Many of them are not owned by developers and, in many ways, often offer more affordable rents than developments. As a result, we must ensure that we keep this symbiotic relationship intact to protect tenants. This can start by addressing the current abuse of the ERAP program. This is a much-needed service that assists renters who are behind on their rent due to unemployment or underemployment caused by the pandemic. When an applicant applies for assistance, the clock stops and they can not be evicted while their application is being processed. This would normally be a godsend for tenants facing some harsh realities during the pandemic because they get a chance for their rent to get paid and the landlord receives relief from the program too.   However, there are a portion of our community who have figured out how to game the system. They file applications knowing that they are not eligible and that they can’t be evicted while their applications are being processed. They repeat the process over and over thereby delaying their evictions while continuing to not pay the landlords and the tenant can apply as many times as they like without prejudice.  This can be devastating to a small landlord who is dependent on the rent from the tenant and with no other means of assistance from the state or federal government they can end up behind in their mortgages and/or property taxes and be forced into a position where they may have to sell their homes (perhaps to developers) for pennies on the dollar. Then they are not able to pass the property down to family which ends up destroying this avenue to generational wealth.  In 2019, Community Board 17’s median household income was $61,940, with 31.60% of households severely rent-burdened. As a result, CB 17 supports the expansion of rental assistance like the ERAP program. We believe that supporting rent-burdened community residents through rental assistance programs will allow residents to remain in their homes and move on to improving their quality of life. We also support the need for more access to a lawyer, like what is offered through the legal aid society when tenants face possible evictions because it has been shown that tenants with representation are more likely to be able to stay in their homes, thereby saving them from becoming homeless in our neighborhood. The pandemic has caused many financial hardships, but we don’t want to see our neighbors end up in the street while working on getting back on their feet.   It is also essential to ensure that there is ample assistance to help potential tenants applying to programs like HUD and section 8 or CityFHEPS for vouchers and the housing lottery on housing connect and, where possible, get these programs expanded to ensure that their applications are completed well; therefore, providing them with a better chance for success. We are aware that many residents within our community are elderly, English language learners, or may not understand the intricacies that go into many of these applications. As a result, it is essential to ensure that help is afforded to CB 17 residents who require it. We also need to get Our elected officials curb the request of real estate companies (and direct landlords) requiring potential tenants to make 3 (three) times the rent requested as this can sometimes edge someone out who could otherwise afford the rent asked.  Furthermore, it is essential to note that increasing the affordable housing stock within our city and district should be paramount. There must be a solution to add more affordable units to our community, starting with our elected representatives. We need to work with our elected representatives to ensure that landlords/developers aren’t “warehousing the apartments” stock by purposely leaving them off the market. At the same time, the owners wait for the rents to rise back to pre-pandemic rates. We also need to have more rules to curb the landlord's/developers' use of short-term rental sites like Airbnb for the available apartments in our community. These units are not hotels, but as long as they are allowed to treat them as such, there will be fewer units to rent long-term because they can make more money on these sites with short-term rentals. Also, identifying vacant and abandoned lots and buildings is critical to ensure that more affordable housing is created in CB 17. Identifying these areas is vital to building more units, which is necessary within our city and district to increase the housing stock and ultimately create more affordable housing. Additionally, when making more units, it is irresponsible not to consider parking, as our neighborhood is where many residents rely on automobiles. Therefore, adding parking garages to new construction is an important consideration.   Residents express immense concerns over gentrification and the neighborhood fabric of Community Board 17, as Brooklyn Community Board 17 has not faced a rezoning in 17 years. Such development pressure is not only a threat to the fabric of the neighborhood but also the well-being of residents and locally owned businesses. They are proving that such adversity is not “just” a zoning issue but an issue of social justice that contributes to the district's affordability, ownership, and public safety. Therefore, CB 17 believes that for us to maintain housing affordability, the effects of gentrification must be addressed. CB 17 is not against a diverse community. However, it is essential that the city is responsible for creating safeguards for residents and securing excellent and affordable housing even when drastic neighborhood change is imminent.","Crime and Public Safety","","​​Public safety is a concern city-wide, with Mayor Adams campaigning to end gun violence.  Community Board 17, which falls in the 67th precinct, calls for more anti-violence initiatives as struggles in 2021, a 9 percent jump in significant crimes. The Deputy of the 67th precinct calls for relationship-building and interaction with the community regarding public safety and well-being. We believe that more community-based officers are essential in curbing the rise of crime and that this should be a priority. But we are also advocates for anti-violence efforts conducted by non-profits such as Elite Learners, Basketball Tournaments at Tilden High School, and summer employment programs for youth, where an increase in funding is also necessary. Post-secondary workforce development would also be a deterrence to concerns of public safety as well. Other efforts to cut down violence also include removing guns from the streets. In January, the 67th precinct pulled 37 guns from the community. Community outreach, social media postings, skills training, and increased funding can be streamlined to continue such initiatives.   Community Board 17 believes land use, sanitation, and housing impact public safety. CB17 lacks open green space and community spaces in neighboring areas such as Prospect Heights. The reasons for this involve questions of equity and systemic injustices. The limited recreational space and opportunities for the Community Board can lead individuals to other unhealthy avenues. Parks such as Tilden Park should be renovated, especially the basketball court. Other parks that require maintenance include the Railroad playground and the park by Nazareth High. A straightforward fix for the gardens is to extend the hours of operation and keep the bathrooms unlocked. While open space can be limited, the community board can work with private and public entities to get creative on how the community views public space.   There are questions on the relationship between public safety and mental health. Allocating resources towards mental health, people with disabilities, and senior populations would make for a stronger, more harmonious community. Community Board 17 is a naturally occurring retirement community with a scarcity of supermarkets. Measures need to be taken to promote food equity, not only in terms of distance but also in food quality. Creating more farmers' market opportunities, perhaps on corridors where safety is a concern, could bring more people to such areas and provide equal access and community. Vibrancy through place-making, whether framer’s markets or community installations, could help to integrate new community facilities and build relationships.   In addition, there need to be more resources allocated to areas causing crime, such as poverty and migration effects, and research on restorative justice techniques to prevent them.","Land use trends","","Community Board 17 has faced harassment from developers seeking interest in one to two-family homes within the district. In addition, home ownership has been known to vary significantly between boroughs and different racial groups. Considering the demographics of Community Board 17, it stands that developers buying up existing properties from homeowners will have a racial impact and affect an individual’s ability to have a stake in their community, as homeownership can be used to build wealth. As of now, much of the community is rent burdened.   New York City has a past with discriminatory real estate practices where loans were not given to lower-income communities of color. Neighborhoods were labeled as a “risk” to loan corporations and color-coded on maps. “Good” candidates for investment were shaded green and blue. At the same time, “risk” candidates were colored yellow and red. Community Board 17, known as C 13, was yellow. While white families could purchase homes and see such homes increase in value, policies have systematically discriminated against families of color who desired the same path. New York City’s gentrification has resulted in further displacement, eviction, or modern-day redlining as developers are building for the top of the real estate market.  Development and zoning disproportionately affect communities of color, and this is not a new concept. Public Advocate Jumaane Williams was the first proponent of a racial impact requirement for developers and has expressed that “the more we have tools […], the more we can sift through what’s just noise and what’s serious and needs to be addressed.” New York City has approved the requirement for racial-equity impact studies before land-use rezoning efforts to protect neighborhoods like Gowanus, Bushwick, Inwood, Two Bridges, and Community Board 17.    While the Land Use Committee has responded to growing concerns of out-of-context development and homeowner harassment, dating back to a letter sent to the Brooklyn Office of the New York City Department of City Planning in June of 2018, there still needs to be an increase in anti-displacement programs in East Flatbush. The Land Use Committee has hosted several community workshops and surveys in the past during an initiative titled “We Shall Not Be Moved” to educate residents on the board's growing concern about displacement and encroaching development.    In February 2020, Community Board 17’s Land Use Committee and Consultants from WXY met with the Brooklyn Office of the New York City Department of City Planning to share a community-led rezoning proposal. A few weeks after the meeting with the New York City Department of City Planning was the unexpected COVID- 19 pandemic. In July 2020, the Land Use Committee sent the Brooklyn Office of the New York City Department of City Planning a memorandum explaining how the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated existing inequity within New York City and shows more than ever, the need for rezoning in Community Board 17. A future rezoning could increase public investment, which is imperative. Developer engagement should also be put into legislation and planning processes. Allowing mixed-use buildings, where the community has a stake in what vendors are provided, can let more childcare opportunities, banks, and schools.   Rapid development occurs predominantly in the northeast and eastern side of Community Board 17. Developments with more units are found on Linden Boulevard and Lenox Road between Flatbush Avenue and Nostrand Avenue. Other pockets of developments currently in the approval process are happening where Flatbush and Nostrand intersect as well as by New York Ave and Foster. There are developments at the start of Remsen Avenue and between Utica Avenue and Kings Highway. A specific 900- unit housing project at Clarkson & Albany has been a point of contention. The development will include rebuilding two of the three homeless shelters that sit near Clarkson & Albany and creating approximately 300 supportive housing units. Other notable sites where community residents fear rapid displacement include Clinton Boulevard, Linden Boulevard, and Farragut Avenue.    Community Board 17 needs support from local non-profits to commit to a zoning amendment. Support from the board and the community will provide a clear and collective message to the city that the Mayor needs to expedite the rezoning process and acknowledge the adverse effects of real estate development. Residents also believe research on how increasing congestion in CB17 will affect schools, the power grid, hospitals, and public transportation is imperative. Suggestions on how to collect such data include the creation of a database and more conducted surveys. In addition, open lines of communication between the community district and other city agencies can help to prevent tax liens and evictions.    Community Board 17’s Contextual Rezoning Plan should provide an inventory of suitable land for residential development and detail the community's maintenance, preservation, sustainability, and housing development goals. If development is going to happen, communities should be given grants to community nonprofits and educational centers to ensure community investment.   The Contextual Rezoning Plan could include multi-family and mixed-use developments by allowing accessory dwelling units (ADUs) to increase housing supply but not contribute to out-of-context development. Seattle has recently rezoned several single-family neighborhoods as “small residential lots.” The classified zoning allows for multifamily housing that is not as dense and matches the fabric of the community. Placing development priority on vacant and underutilized land can also increase housing options without harassing homeowners.   Community Board 17 could also advocate for interventions that promote rent regulation and short-term rentals to help residents and prevent displacement. Community Board 17 should also explore ways to adopt laws protecting residents from evictions. Units should be offered below market rate to renters of different income brackets. Other ways to stabilize include a community benefits agreement where non-profits and on-ground- organizations can help to keep development in line with the community’s vision for the future. Community Land-trusts also help to give people a stake in their community. ","","","","","Chronic disease prevention and management (diabetes, heart disease, etc.)","","COVID-19, while devastating to our community, has been layered on preexisting and ongoing health issues plaguing our community. Access to Health Care and information that will empower our community to make healthier informed choices for healthcare remains a focus for this community. While diabetes, obesity, and hypertension are just as high or higher in our community as compared to the entire City of New York, we have an additional obligation to ensure our mental health needs remain at the forefront of any services being provided to the community and those services must include awareness, acceptance, and access. The latest data available at the time of this narrative was released from The NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene in April and May of 2020 found “New Yorkers to be experiencing stress, anxiety, and depression, and parents reported the emotional or behavioral health of children as being negatively affected by COVID-19”. We are in the aftermath of these occurrences, and the Mayor’s Office of Community Mental Health states one in five New Yorkers experiences mental illness each year.  That’s about 65% of Brooklynites.  ","Access to Health Care, and Prevention Screening are two health related issues that affects the East Flatbush district. As noted in the NYC DOHMH Community Health Survey.   A lack of quality health care can lead to negative health outcomes and more intensive treatment such as avoidable hospitalizations. Adults in The same can be said for Prevention and Screening of various illnesses, such as Breast Cancer, HPV, Flu and HIV testing.  When screening is applied it can be most effective in people living longer, healthier lives.   We support the creation and promotion of programs that increase awareness and encourage treatment of mental health.  The many components of ThriveNYC, which aims to reduce mental illness stigma and close the gap in behavioral health services by integrating mental health care into primary care practices needs to be expanded to more low-income neighborhoods.  It is difficult for physicians to ascertain the living conditions in which their patients come from and return to after clinic visits and especially after hospitalization. Increased services could help individuals cope with stressful situations. ","We request that the Department For The Aging implement funded programs. There is a need for C2 housing to meet the needs of our aging population, namely: assisted living, independent living, and dependent living. Our population continues to age like the rest of the country; the frail and elderly are growing more numerous. There is a desperate need for additional senior centers and programs throughout the district. In addition, nutritional resources for older adults implemented during the pandemic should be maintained. ","Provide rental assistance/vouchers for permanent housing. The gap between affordable and unaffordable continues to rise. Families are facing eviction into homelessness due to rent increases and factors such as low-wage work. CB17 requests that programs be implemented to accommodate families and singles who, due to their income range, fall within the borders of unaffordability thus deeming them unable to apply for affordable units. We believe the income range is a disadvantage to many residents in our district. ","Other Work Experience Program Requests: With the phasing out of the Work Experience Program, participants seeking independence and self-support must be provided with alternatives that continue to improve the skills they already possess and allow them opportunities to develop new abilities that increase their chances of employment. Support the maintenance of resources for those unemployed due to the current market instability. ","","","","","Other - Write In (Required)","","New York City has seen more than sixty thousand Asylum seekers who have taken residence in the five boroughs over the last six months. According to an article written in Chalkbeat, at least 5500 have now been enrolled in our schools across the boroughs. Many of these students have high needs for bilingual teachers, Social Workers, and Health & Mental Services. To help address these students' social and emotional needs, we will be required to help them adjust to their new environments by providing limited services and programs in our schools. The increased number of students will call for additional funding to add other resources to our schools.    New York received 8.9 Billion from The American Rescue plan and the Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief State Plan; part of these funds was allocated for Mental health services, Social Workers, and expanding Afterschool Programs. This year, the NYC school budget is 38 Billion due to all the funding sources. However, the issue becomes what happens when these funding sources are depleted; how do we continue to provide the adequate resources and tools needed for our schools? Covid has set our students back to an all-time academic low. To maintain a level of educational advancement and provide those necessary services, we need to maintain a level of funding from Public and private sources that will give us the economic advantage that our students need.  School-Based Health clinics in our schools are essential. They add value to address our students' health and emotional needs and provide parents with an avenue they can navigate outside the regular healthcare system. Students can utilize these services during the school day without missing school. Currently, Community Board 17 has no School-Based Health Clinics in the community. A much essential and needed resource that can positively impact our students. Social workers are a requirement in schools as they help address and deal with the complexities that may affect social interactions and behaviors at school or home. In April 2022, the State's Comptroller's office found that of the school districts analyzed, 95% did not meet the recommended ratio of one school social worker for every 250 students. Afterschool Programs provide opportunities for students to develop skills and pursue an interest in Music & Art, Athletic Sports, Stem or Steam activities, College essays, etc.   We must ensure that funding for these services remains a constant staple within our schools. The advantages they provide for the students in our community are essential to the core of their success. Community Board 17 will continue to advocate for these services through Federal, State, and City Funding (elected officials), CBOs, and Private entities. The need for growth and development through programs and services in our schools creates positive outcomes through test scores, increased graduation rates, and equitable opportunities for the students in our community.","We must ensure that funding for School-Based Health clinics, counseling and social worker, and after-school programs must remain a constant staple within our schools.

The need for growth and development through programs and services in our schools creates positive outcomes through test scores, increased graduation rates, and equitable opportunities for the students in our community.   ","Many of our young people lack the skills necessary for employment. We request continued funding of programs that offer a broader range of opportunities for youth to explore their career and educational interests. Developmental programs such as ""Learn and Earn"" and ""Train and Earn"" that assist participants in overcoming barriers to employment, have proven successful over the years. Community Board 17 also supports the Ladder for leaders program that allows partnering with relevant city agencies and/or community partners to create pathways and opportunities for youth and communities at large, to gain experience in the tech, entrepreneurship and entertainment/media field. ","","","","","General crime","","As a result of the increase in crimes within our community, we believe that addressing the root cause and putting in place preventative measures, such as increasing the number of law enforcement officers within CB17 and the 67th precinct, would create a safer community and removing guns from our streets is imperative as they are the primary cause for most of the murders. The board believes that the NYPD must focus on the uptick in crimes in our neighborhood. It is alarming that the 67th Precinct has the 3rd highest rate of murders of all precincts in Brooklyn. The truth is that even though the percentage of change between 2021 to 2022 is not drastic, there has been a 25% increase. The mere fact remains that the rate of murder is not decreasing but is increasing, which ultimately causes several other issues community-wide, such as an effect on the quality of life, since fearful residents would spend less time in their communities and on their community streets as well as visiting the stores in our community. It is incumbent on the city to ensure that safety and the preservation of lives remain paramount.    Additionally, the implementation of the Neighborhood Coordinating Officers (NCO), an initiative that engages community members and officers, has garnered applause from most community residents and is still a needed continued face of our community. This form of community policing, or community-oriented policing, is a proven, evidence-based model of police building ties and working closely with members of the communities. Additionally, The Board supports the Advocates Intervene Mentor (AIM) program and requests the program be expanded and hire more mentors.   The Board also believes that crime prevention programs are most effective when they operate within the community and involve community residents actively working with local government agencies to address issues contributing to crimes such as murder and delinquency. There need to be increased funding for vandalism prevention, domestic violence prevention, youth crime prevention, and other crime prevention programs. Organizations such as the 67th Precinct Council and other organizations like it are essential in providing crime prevention programming for the community, another form of prevention that we still deem to be necessary.  Furthermore, it is essential to note that creating access to economic opportunities through employment can reduce crime. Therefore, CB 17 advocates for more job training programs and access to employment pipelines within our community. We believe that a concerted effort to increase the hiring and outreach efforts for young people from our community into high-paying civil service jobs, such as the FDNY, NYPD, etc., as well as other in-demand high-paying private sector jobs, can create opportunities for advancement and put money into the pockets of young people and young adults, ultimately keeping them away from crime. ","CB 17 believes that reducing crime within our community must be the utmost priority. Laws such as Bail reform allow criminals to be set free immediately after committing crimes, leading to repeat offenses. Laws such as these must be reassessed if we are going to see a community with reduced crimes. Furthermore, because our district is plagued with a high crime rate charging criminals with lesser charges which can then allow dangerous offenders back on the streets, is a dangerous practice. We call for an uncompromising approach to crime to have a safer community. ","Community Board 17 is overly concerned about the ongoing vague response to issues of concern to the community. This is particularly concerning when we are aware that crime is rampant in our community. Therefore, we must ensure that response times do not increase but are decreased. CB17 also reiterates the importance of prioritizing funding for additional Precinct Outposts, a Fire Prevention Inspection Team, Juvenile FireSetter Intervention program, and carbon monoxide and smoke detectors for distribution to seniors and other residents unable to afford the purchase. ","","","","","Cleanliness/trash collection","","Sanitation is an ongoing issue in Community Board 17. The COVID-19 Pandemic enunciated the negative health impacts of poor sanitation in the community. There need to be more resources allocated to enforce anti-dumping and vehicle abandonment regulations. Related to public safety, abandoned cars are also an issue in Community Board 17. While the 67th precinct has successfully made efforts to remove some abandoned vehicles, resources such as tow trucks are limited and insufficient to keep up with the rate at which vehicles need to be removed.  Catch basins, especially along commercial corridors, are inadequate to control the amount of sewage/overflow accumulating during storms and everyday operations. Currently, the catch basins are being tended to infrequently, leaving residents responsible for catch basin maintenance.   Garbage accumulation, both on the street, in garbage bins, and front of many businesses in our business corridors, is also a concern. A suggestion to prevent such actions and catch repeat offenders would be to install cameras at prime hot zones. Notable sites include Rutland Road and 98th Street and surrounding the Holy Cross cemetery. In tandem with the cameras, businesses could be hit with stricter rules and regulations or even incentives to be active in the community and keep the neighborhood clean. On Nostrand Avenue and Church, there is one trash bin. This is a prime commuter area, and residents have expressed the need for more containers in this area and all of our business corridors. Additionally, Business Improvement Districts (BID) in these areas could help keep these areas clean and presentable.  Furthermore, we believe that garbage collection times should be reconsidered. Nighttime collection in all areas may curb traffic issues experienced in our districts as a result of garbage trucks blocking roads during the usual morning collections. Furthermore, the nighttime collection will also help keep business corridors clean since garbage is usually left in these areas overnight, leaving a messy and unsanitary appearance for the community during the morning hours.  ","","","","","","","Land use and zoning","","Rapid development is taking place predominantly in the northeast and eastern side of Community Board 17 in areas zoned for higher densities. Developments with a larger number of units are found on Linden Boulevard and Lenox Road between Flatbush Avenue and Nostrand Avenue. Other pockets of developments currently in the approval process are happening where Flatbush and Nostrand intersect as well as by New York Ave and Foster. There are developments taking place at the start of Remsen Avenue and between Utica Avenue and Kings Highway. A specific 900- unit housing project taking place at Clarkson & Albany has been a point of contention. The development will include rebuilding two of the three homeless shelters that sit near Clarkson & Albany and creating approximately 300 supportive housing units. Other notable sites where community residents fear rapid displacement has taken place include Clinton Boulevard, Linden Boulevard, and Farragut Avenue.    Community Board 17 needs support from local non-profits to commit to a zoning amendment. Support from the board and the community will provide a clear and collective message to the city that the Mayor needs to expedite the rezoning process and acknowledge the adverse effects of real estate development. Residents also believe research on how increasing unplanned congestion in CB17 will affect schools, the power grid, hospitals, and public transportation is imperative. Suggestions on how to collect such data include the creation of a database and more conducted surveys. In addition, open lines of communication between the community district and other city agencies can help to prevent tax liens and evictions.    Community Board 17’s Contextual Rezoning Plan should provide an inventory of suitable land for residential development and detail the community's goals for maintenance, preservation, sustainability, and development of housing. If development is going to happen, communities should be given grants to community nonprofits and educational centers to ensure community investment.  The Contextual Rezoning Plan could include multi-family and mixed-use developments by allowing accessory dwelling units (ADUs) to increase housing supply but not contribute to out-of-context development. Seattle has recently rezoned several single-family neighborhoods as “a small residential lot.” The classified zoning allows for multifamily housing that is not as dense and matches the neighborhood's fabric. Placing development priority on vacant and underutilized land can also increase housing options without harassing homeowners.   Community Board 17 could also advocate for interventions that promote rent regulation and short-term rentals that can help residents and prevent displacement. Community Board 17 should also explore ways to adopt laws protecting residents from evictions. Units should be offered below market rate to renters of different income brackets. ","","","There is a need to implement more BIDs in CB 17 business areas such as, but not limited to, Utica and East New York Avenue, going southbound on Utica Avenue to Clarendon Road and Utica Avenue and Church Avenue eastbound on Church Avenue to Remsen Avenue, Rutland Road, and East 98th St. The implementation of a BID would promote goodwill between the association members and the residents of the immediately adjacent areas. It will also promote businesses, improve shopping in the community through merchants and civic action projects and foster a stronger relationship between merchants, residents, service agencies, and law enforcement for the betterment of the community. Furthermore, The nonaccess to working capital during Covid-19 and after has put the small business community at a severe disadvantage. A few small businesses will need to close their doors for good because they can no longer afford to stay open. One of the most significant expenses for a small business is the continuing rise of commercial rents. Small businesses can no longer afford to remain open because of the increased price of retail rents. Also, small businesses could use some drastic increases in their annual revenues. Increasing the incomes of small businesses would also help their bottom line.   ","","","","","Other - Write In (Required)","","Some bus lanes within our community negatively impact the economic health of our small businesses. For instance, the small business community relies on easy access to deliveries and consumer traffic for sustainability and profitability within the district. Unfortunately, some bus lanes create congestion during the day due to the clash of schedules, consequently preventing ease of access to deliveries, supplies, and consumer purchases, for instance, on Utica Avenues and Nostrand Avenues. Businesses need to be profitable to remain open. The schedule of these bus lanes needs to be reevaluated to foster a better collaboration with the daily schedules of our small business to improve commerce.  Primarily, the schedules in Utica seem to pose top concerns.   Reduction of Street Cameras & Increase in Speed Bumps  Historically, we've found that speed cameras are usually located in areas that cause an economic burden to our local community. According to the observation of the transportation committee, speed cameras have no real tangible impact on accidents locally except for being a tax on the poor. For example, these areas were initially designated for creating safety areas within school zones. Unfortunately, the cameras have randomly branched outside non-school zones and into shared spaces throughout our community. Community Board 17 does not support the mayor's position to expand cameras city-wide. We request a project to remove security cameras from non-school zones and relocate them to their designated areas. Also, we are asking to discontinue adding additional cameras within the community. To effectively impact accidents within the district, the board requests that the city implement speed bumps as an alternative to speed cameras within non-school zone locations. Additionally, the board is asking that all of these points be considered in our local community's capital plan.   Subway service and quality (frequency, access, crowding, etc.) The Board continues to receive complaints regarding congestion on Utica Avenue, double parked cars, blocked businesses, and parked on the sidewalk have become the norm in the district. The installation of the bus lanes has yet to remedy the situation. Also, the idea for a potential subway extension will only increase the volume of traffic along this corridor, causing double parking and negatively impacting businesses. Additionally, there is a need for improved bus services throughout the district and bus sheds and benches.  For example, Albany Ave, Glenwood Rd, Rutland Rd, and East 98th St, a heavily traveled areas in the district, where many seniors utilize the bus services.   ","","","","","","","Park care and maintenance","","Park maintenance is essential to the cleanliness of our parks and requires the hiring of additional gardeners and other skilled non-managerial personnel. The Board requests the expansion of athletic programs and educational programs in Computer Resource Centers, to attract the youth in our district. We also request a feasibility study be conducted at our Parks to determine the installation of a swimming pool or other recreational facilities, a recreational need that would benefit the community as a whole","Park maintenance is essential to the cleanliness of our parks and requires hiring additional gardeners and other skilled non-managerial personnel.

Additionally, we ask that areas where seniors can gather to exercise be implemented in multiple locations within our community. ","There is a urgent need for collaborative efforts to bring together various private and government funds to support, strengthen and expand arts and cultural nonprofits in Community District 17.  The Board believes that cultural facilities and programs will promote and contribute to the culture and economic lives of the community, by creating jobs, cultural tourism, expand access and education in the arts, humanities and sciences, while improving the quality of life for community residents at large.","Community Board 17 supports increased funding for the Brooklyn Public Library to provide the much-needed services, supplies, and equipment for our Branch libraries so that the needs of our students and adult population can be met. The three branches in CD 17, Rugby Branch, Clarendon Branch, and East Flatbush Branch, offer programs such as Homework Help, Tutoring, Computer Classes and Games, and Internet/Email Classes, among others. ","The role of the Community Boards has expanded throughout the years, which requires more staffing to satisfy the needs of the office and assist with the required service delivery needs of the community.

Covering one of the largest geographical land areas of any Community Board in the City, a ""snapshot"" look captures the heart and the spirit of Brooklyn ... multi-ethnic, middle class neighborhoods with a solid tax base of single family, multi-family, mid-rise buildings with a scattering of condominiums and cooperative development.  These neighborhoods have been characterized as some of the finest places in New York to live in, raise a family, start a business, or invest in future development. The hallmark of Community Board #18 is our network of volunteer, civic, parent, religious, and service organizations.  The harmonious and constant interchange between neighborhoods, groups, residents and local elected officials has built the very foundation that keeps the fabric of our communities stable while planning for future growth and development. Within our boundaries, are several high-rise buildings including housing for senior citizens, the homeless, and three (3) N.Y.C. Housing Authority (NYCHA) Projects, Bayview, Breukelen, and Glenwood Houses, which require a ""boots-on-the-ground"" commitment to rehabilitation, full upgrading and extensive modernization.  In light of the recent shocking revelations concerning the safety and lead paint issues in many of the NYCHA Developments, our Community Board is demanding a full and complete basement to roof apartment and common area inspections to determine any and all possible code violations that may exist along with a remediation plan and ""tight"" time table for implementation. Floyd Bennett Field, located in our district, became part of Gateway National Recreation Area in 1972.  It is an historic treasure -- the first municipal airfield and an aerial hub for fighter planes during World War II, where the sounds of the departing aircraft of Wiley Post, Amelia Earhart, and Douglas ""wrong-way"" Corrigan stand as a living testament to times past.  Views from the control tower at Floyd Bennett Field gave clear vision to the crisscrossing runways of New York's first municipal airport.  Explore Hanger B, built in 1941 by the U.S. Navy and used primarily for seaplanes spans an enormous two (2) acres in size, where airplanes return to life.  Every corner of Hangar B is filled with aircraft from literally every era of aviation.  The aircraft restoration efforts are the work of the Historic Aircraft Restoration Project (HARP) created and staffed entirely by volunteers and funded by grant money.  HARP works hard to meet Smithsonian's standard for aircraft restoration.  You can see any sort of aircraft going as far back as a replica of the Wright Brothers model, WWII aircraft, and a fully restored Grumman JRF-5 ""Goose"" flying boat, which, back in the 1930's would have been used to transport wealthy Gold Coast clientele to Wall Street, literally landing in the river.  The dream of a restored Floyd Bennett Field for recreational use with water-access must not be forgotten.  The restoration of the boat docks at Floyd Bennett Field and at Canarsie Pier would allow for the use of the on-again, off-again use of water ferries at peak times to facilitate the movement of participants of large outdoor events as well as visitors to the Park, the islands off the coast of Canarsie, the sports entertainment complex at Floyd Bennett Field, and it would enable commuter connection with other parts of the borough and city.  The current Ferry Service Plan includes neighborhoods in all the boroughs as a link to existing ferry service to Manhattan.  The service for South Brooklyn is in Bay Ridge.  Mayor de Blasio promised us Ferry Service at Canarsie Pier without any results.  As we usher in the 10th Anniversary of Super Storm ""Sandy,"" we remain appalled by the lack of speed and clarity in not developing a strengthened coastal defense resiliency plan for our shoreline as the first line of defense against flooding and sea level rise.  The hopes that all the shore communities shared after October 29, 2012 have never been realized and have been ""washed away"" in a sea of bureaucracy, indifference and red tape.  Long range storm protection remains one of our top priorities.  We must continue to partner with all levels of Government to make this battle to protect our shoreline communities a reality rather than another report lying in a pile of reports in some agency.  Future additional funding through the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act of 2013 is necessary to implement short and long-range goals for rebuilding and enhancing our infrastructure to accept the potential of another super storm surge.  The Army Corps of Engineers must advance their flood protection plans to fortify the seawall side of the peninsula with the erection of seawalls and gates around the waterfront that could open or close in a storm threat to divert or redirect the surge. The Covid-19 Pandemic has upended the Capital and Expense Budgets for this Fiscal Year. Our ability to ""map an agenda"" for the more focused needs and priorities of the Community Board remain fluid as we await the impact of a Washington stimulus package and the current budget negotiations that are due to take shape in Albany and at City Hall.  Consequently, the severe cutbacks in services and capital project priorities, joined with a citywide job freeze and the threat of massive personnel layoffs, further challenges our ability to develop a more cohesive budget plan. We continue to look toward government on all levels for the realization that without an infusion of real cash into our struggling economy planning for future growth remains elusive as we struggle to meet a comprehensive program of infrastructure improvement, reconstruction and development of our service needs.  Our Board stands ready to partner in this budget process during the challenges that remain ahead. ","","","","","Infrastructure resiliency","","INFRASTRUCTURE RESILIENCY:  On October 29, 2012, in the wake of super-storm “Sandy,” the East Coast saw the destruction of whole communities, businesses and infrastructure.  Our neighborhoods were no exception and are still recovering.  Bergen Beach, Canarsie, Gerritsen Beach/Plumb Beach, Marine Park and Mill Island suffered wide-spread damage … double-digit millions in property damage … untold personal loss … businesses destroyed and disrupted … lives lost and families uprooted.  The very fabric of our neighborhoods and road conditions were torn apart.  Build-it-Back is still attempting to repair damages to homes caused by their original inferior repairs.  Sewers and water delivery systems must be upgraded so catch basins and storm sewers can properly drain the roadways during heavy rain storms.  Resiliency programs for our waterfront communities are necessary to prevent future flooding disasters for our environment and the quality of life for our communities and residents. ","Parks and open space","","PARKS: Community Board #18 has the distinction of being ""home"" to the largest acreage of parkland in the City utilized by visitors from all over the city.  Marine Park is home to 798 Acres of parkland and Canarsie Park is home to 132.2 Acres of parkland.  Portions of both parks have been improved with recreational facilities.  Marine Park also houses a nature center and nature trail.  With that distinction goes a myriad of problems that must be addressed with limited manpower and equipment.  Borough Commissioner, Martin Maher, and Department of Parks and Recreation Personnel, in general, demonstrate a generous spirit of cooperation and assistance in delivering timely, quality service to address the needs of our community.    Within our Community Board are numerous small “vest pocket” parks that require regular attention and maintenance.  Commissioner Silver calls it a framework for an equitable future.  We feel that equity should include the communities that we serve and we look forward to new funds dedicated to upgrading and maintaining our neighborhood parks.    We call upon the Administration to supply the Department of Parks and Recreation with the funds and tools necessary to adequately provide maintenance and care of our ""under-resourced"" parks and large tree population, and to provide quality recreational and cultural outlets for all ages. ","Street conditions (roadway maintenance)","","STREET CONDITIONS:  Our street system was, in most part, build on unsupported land fill.  The streets, road bed and sewer system are old and in need of full reconstruction ... not just repair ... which is nothing short of a ""band aid to control arterial bleeding.""  They are in various stages of collapse and require personnel and funding for a staged reconstruction plan by DOT and DEP to turn the plan into reality.","","","","","Programs, services or facilities for seniors (incl. remote programming, cooling centers)","","Our senior population needs the Administration to provide a ""boots-on-the ground"" commitment to rehabilitate, upgrade and perform an extensive modernization of our facilities and services.    These facilities will provide sorely needed recreational and rehabilitative activities for our seniors to live long, productive lives.  They will also be able to provide quality intergenerational programs and activities for our energetic youth population.  Our network of senior centers is not fully funded to provide hot meals, not only on the weekdays, but the weekends as well.  Funding should be made available to increase the meal and senior advocacy programs throughout the Board area.  Programming must provide intense outreach to identify and provide services for home-bound seniors in need of services. ","Community Board #18 is the ""host"" to one of the largest and ever-growing senior populations in the City.  Our system of senior centers and day programs is grossly inadequate.  We need the centers that are currently being run, to be upgraded and at least two (2) full service centers to be built.  Full staffing of Drop-in Day Centers and a structured program of outreach to ""shut-in"" seniors would help to fill a growing need.  Additionally, there is no one-stop location where a senior can go for help and direction.  A senior citizen advocate housed at the Community Board makes good old ""common sense"" and should be considered for future funding. The Health Care System needs advocacy -- not just hope, but a pressing need for a solid commitment from the Department for the Aging to establish multi-purpose senior facilities and senior housing.  We look forward to long and short range objectives for meeting these goals.

However, our goals can NEVER be achieved without an infusion of funding and ""real"" development by the City.  We suggest that the Administration build on the model of the Community Service Society and their approach of the early 80's by bringing to our community a paid coordinator to develop, enhance and support the building of a truly structured Youth Service Agenda.","We are currently working with our local elected officials, community and youth organizations, to secure funds for special programs designated to address identified youth problems.  By reaching students with vitally important services, ranging from mental health support to homework help and family counseling, schools will help at-risk children succeed in the classroom and beyond.      While we continue to stress the importance of traditional public school education, we also recognize the role of the Charter School in the ""repurposed"" educational environment.  Consequently, we stand ready to work with all of the stakeholders in advancing the educational structure that best meet the needs of our children.  We urge the Administration to continue to support collaboration between administrators, parents, and teachers for all students.    The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) became federal law in 1990 and states: “No qualified individual with a disability shall, on the basis of disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any public entity.”  The New York City Department of Education (DOE) data indicates that only one (1) out of every five (5) city schools is fully accessible to students, parents, staff and other community members with physical disabilities.  Students with physical disabilities find themselves cut off from the majority of DOE schools because of architectural barriers and are, instead, forced to travel significant distances and make academic and curricular compromises to attend schools they can physically access.  We call upon the New York City Department of Education to include $850 million additional funding in their 2020-2024 Capital Plan for accessibility projects with the goal of making at least one-third of New York City public schools in each district ADA accessible to help create a system where all are welcomed and included.","There is an increasing need for child day care services as well as after school programs.   Both parents working, as well as single parent households, created a desperate need for day care and after school activities for our youth.","","","","","Crime prevention programs","","Explanation","The need for a new 63rd Precinct Stationhouse continues to be an absolute necessity. Although the Department allocates funds for rehabilitation of the antiquated Stationhouse to meet staffing needs and patrol requirements, the poor conditions and problems still exist. Funding must be set aside for relocation. Since the existence of Community Boards in 1977, we have stressed the need for a New Modern 63rd Precinct House. Each year the Department never includes funding into its Capital Plan. The new Capital Budget, with its excess ""dollars"" means that this year the project can be funded. We are guardingly optimistic that our wish over these last forty two (42) years becomes a reality. Modern, adequately sized police precincts are essential to good policing.  We urge the NYPD to aggressively explore the acquisition of city-owned properties. Where development costs would be minimized ... new Police Precincts Do Not need to be centralized in a community ... with the communications available today location is secondary to space needs!! ","We are optimistic that funds will be increased to establish an even greater emergency service presence for the improvement of service deliveries to battle fires, reduce crime, and enhance quality of life conditions within our Community Board area.    Fire protection in a residential community comprising tens of thousands of frame dwellings is, obviously, of paramount concern.   The theory used by the Fire Department for ""manning"" decisions includes statistics that must include, literally, thousands of homes and tens of thousands of area residents residing in those homes as well as the illegally converted apartments that have become part of the Board area since the statistical information was updated.  Consequently, analysis of the Department's decision should be the subject of ""up-to-date"" review not budgetary constraints.    We urge the Mayor's Community Affairs Unit (CAU), the Office of Citywide Event Coordination and Management (CECM), and the Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications (DOITT) to continue the strong working relationship between their centralized staff and our Community Board to assist in the coordination and approval of Street Activity Permits and the resolution of community and telecommunication issues and problems.  We commend their constant expansion of internet access and support to our Board.      The introduction of the multi-functional high tech kiosks is an important step in the introduction of a first-of-its-kind communication network offering up free Wi-Fi, phone calls, charging stations for mobile phones, along with a host of other functions.  The Community Board has expressed concern about their placement and strongly suggest that they be placed in heavily travelled transit intersections and not be placed near any school or park.    Data report listings posted on NYC.gov was an important step toward sharing 311 Citizen Service Center complaint collection data.  However, we continue to stress the need to be informed about specific complaint collection data encompassing location, tracking and resolution.  Interaction and sharing of information between city agencies and the Community Board will continue to enhance service delivery and further our efforts to improve the quality of life for our residents and the business community.","","","","","Protective infrastructure (sea walls, flood walls, etc.)","","October marked the 9th anniversary of Super Storm Sandy.  While much has been accomplished in repairing and rebuilding our communities, much still remains to be done.  Community Board #18 borders on Jamaica Bay.  “Sandy” inflicted triple digit millions in property damage to our neighborhoods … destroyed its fabric … dislocated and closed businesses … and brought tragic fatalities to our scenic communities.  The ""Build It Back"" Program proved to be a total failure in providing aid to our ravaged community.  It was only after Mayor de Blasio, and our elected officials made a concerted effort to repurpose the program that we began to see some tangible results.  Homes began to be rebuilt, businesses began to re-open, and plans were drawn to bring new life into a failed bureaucratic nightmare.  There is still much to be done for homeowners and businesses to fully recover!       The New York City Panel on Climate Change (NPCC) uses global climate models and a range of scenarios to develop climate projections relating to future population, economic growth, and technological change.  Future 100 year Flood Zones clearly states that by the 2020’s there is an expected 10’ sea level rise.  The NPCC projects that by mid-century (2050), sea levels could rise up to 21 inches, up to 39 inches by the 2080's, posing a significant threat to New York City’s low-lying neighborhoods, not just during storms, but also in the case of tidal flooding.  Additionally, the NPCC predicts that there will be an increase in the most intense hurricanes occurring in the North Atlantic Basin.  Higher temperatures and increased coastal flooding are the greatest risks.  We must quickly build a stronger, more resilient New York.      We must continue to partner with all levels of Government to make this battle to protect our shoreline communities a reality rather than another report lying in a pile of reports in some agency.  Future additional funding through the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act of 2013 is necessary to implement short and long range goals for rebuilding and enhancing our infrastructure to accept the potential of another super storm surge.

After the storm, press releases were issued, promises were made and commitments were assured. Nevertheless, those commitments and promises have had little, if any, tangible effects. Billions of dollars were sent to the City and State from the Federal Government. Sad to say after almost seven (7) years, few of our communities including those now sitting in the ""A"" Zone of the newly drawn Flood Zone Maps, have seen little of these dollars or productive re-build programs. The de Blasio Administration was handed a bureaucratic mess. Only now have they been able to start the process of making actual awards to begin the rebuilding and repair process. It's still slow and bogged down in administrative ""red tape.""  Public Forums funded by the Governor's Office of Storm Recovery - New York Rising Community Reconstruction Program, and the Mayor's Office of Housing Recovery Operations, must continue to rebuild neighborhoods impacted by ""Sandy"" and, through community-driven plans, prepare them to become more resilient.  Funds have been allocated and the reconstruction is in progress for the Canarsie community area sewer system from the East 108th Street area, Flatlands to Seaview Avenues. We must continue to fund the reconstruction of all our old, deteriorated and inadequate sewer systems to upgrade and meet the increased usage demand to eliminate future flooding and hazardous road conditions. ","BK18 supervision and personnel have been exemplary in their willingness and demonstrated ability to work with the Board in developing the maximum potential with their limited manpower and equipment to deliver quality service to a community experiencing ever-increasing population growth and needs as they implement further source separation and recycling programs.  Recycling continues to be another top priority ... a daunting challenge in our residential community which requires more outreach and education to area residents and homeowners.    Increased manpower is also needed to maintain the numerous center malls along our roadways.  Neglected and unattended they grow into breeding grounds for vermin and illegal dumping creating a community nuisance and safety hazard.  Lot cleaning, attention to the ASP cleaning schedule and the quick removal of the illegally placed clothing bins is a top priority.  Stronger laws and enforcement with severe penalties for the placement of illegal “Clothing Donation Bins” placed throughout our communities and on private property parking lots have been put in place.  Develop a strategy to “tag” the bins only to have them shifted to another must also adhere to a strong commitment of interminable rigorous enforcement of this ""quality of life"" violation.       Snow removal is obviously one of the top priorities for the Department.  After the thaw we are inundated with sink and pot holes caused by the road salt.  We urge the City to move forward with the use of less corrosive snow removal materials.","","","","","Condition of public housing","","Bayview NYCHA Houses - There is a drastic need for Capital Improvements on the elevators within the entire complex. Elevators are old and frequently breaking down causing seniors undue stress and physoical burden. ","On June 30, 2009 the City Council approved the DCP ULURP Application for lower density and contextual zoning map changes for the Canarsie neighborhood. Community Board #18 unanimously supported the ULURP Application. That text amendment has set the standard for future development.  We support further review by DCP and urge new efforts be made to address the population growth and the inequities in R-32A and R-4 Zoning Districts which cover large areas of our Board.  It is the sense of this Board that all of the communities within our Board be reviewed to create a rational up-to-date zoning plan that reflects natural residential, commercial, and manufacturing boundaries. The current land use is largely an artifact of historical urbanization.  Future land use must be controlled by zoning, public policy, and land use regulations intended to promote activities appropriate to preserve the neighborhood character and infrastructure for those who live and work there. The approval of the Zoning Text Amendments sends a clear signal of the intent of the City Administration to impact neighborhood development.  We must continue to review regulations to determine if the zoning does, in fact, reflect current and future housing conditions and needs.  A partner in the planning process is the Board of Standard and Appeals (BSA).  BSA's original mission was to provide a relief valve for property owners in those rare circumstances where existing zoning regulations prohibited them from reasonably developing their property.  BSA is frequently misused to circumvent and twist the spirit and intent of the Zoning Resolution. ","After decades of neglect and mismanagement, NYCHA finds themselves having to address the cover-up that has drawn national attention to the reality that lead paint, asbestos, faulty boilers as well as broken elevators has made the City of New York the nation's largest slumlord.     We are guardingly optimistic that the Court Appointed Monitor and mandated repairs will bring some measure of relief to the tenants of NYCHA properties that have had to endure these hardships.","EDC’s priorities are not necessarily “in sync” with the communities and the community boards.  So, at this time, we respectfully request that any other plans or intrusions into our community, under the guise of economic development, should be shared with us in its earliest phase rather than be notified when the matter is a “fait accompli,”  e.g., the “Booze Boats.”","","","","","Roadway maintenance","","Transportation needs, particularly total street and sewer reconstruction, contract resurfacing, and scheduled repair of the roadways within the Board area, presents an ever increasing challenge.  Canarsie and surrounding communities were built on landfill that rapidly deteriorated and require aggressive street and sewer reconstructive programs.        The Community Board urges the Department of Transportation to advance our Board's meager Capital Project requests.  Street resurfacing is a temporary ""costly fix” … not a solution.  It’s “band aid” therapy for a hemorrhage!  Our roadways have recently seen a high increase of “sink holes” as a result of the road bed undermining from “Sandy.”  An emergency “hands-on” effort by DOT and DEP must address this major community need and concern.","The DOT has undertaken the ""Reconstruction of the Seven (7) Bridges on the Belt Parkway"" which commenced with minimal impact in November 2009 with the first of three contracts in our Board area - Fresh Creek Bridge, Paerdegat Basin Bridge, two (2) separate bridges eastbound and westbound, and the Rockaway Parkway Bridge. The Mill Basin Draw Bridge, a fixed structure with 60-foot clearance over ""Mean High Water"" obviating the need for opening and closing the bridge, is now scheduled for completion.  All impacts to wetlands will be mitigated in accordance with Federal and State regulations.  The landscaping contract will complete the project this year.   Transportation issues persist to rank high on the problem list for our Community Board. Pedestrian, cyclist, and motor vehicle occupant safety at many of the intersections and streets within our Board area are the source of major concern.  With no enforcement of regulations in place, the administration is still aggressively expanding biker-friendly infrastructure.  The number of bile paths citywide has more than doubled in the last decade.  Bicycle lanes clearly offer both an environmental and practical benefit in areas served by adequate mass transit alternatives and a biker-friendly population. Bike lanes, if not properly placed and enforced, will only create hazardous conditions in our board area and jeopardize the safety of pedestrians, cyclists, and motor vehicle occupants.   Public education and community participation in new street designs and configurations to improve safety must continue to be an integral part of the planning and placement process along with expanded enforcement against dangerous moving violations for drivers and cyclists to ensure safety on city streets. ","Numerous costly and time consuming studies have been performed by outside consultants, the Departments of Transportation and City Planning, as well as the Borough President's Office, in an effort to improve pedestrian, vehicular, and bus circulation problems at the intersection of Flatbush Avenue and Avenue U.  It remains one of the most accident plagued intersections in the city.  The studies continue to identify the same problems and continue to propose a myriad number of improvements including changes in bus stop locations and operations, directional signage, street configuration with the widening of Avenue U and Flatbush Avenue, and the installation of pedestrian safety fencing along the South side of Avenue U, from Flatbush Avenue to East 55th Street, and on the center traffic island on Flatbush Avenue, between Avenues U and V.  Conditions were worsened by the creation of a ""bus layover/turnaround"" and an illegal ""dollar"" van pick-up area on Flatbush Avenue at Avenue U, in and around Kings Plaza Shopping Center.  The ""App"" driven car services send an Uber or Lyft to that location and have taken a bad situation and made it worse.  They added to the congestion and made Flatbush Avenue and Avenue U crossroads into a pedestrian and motor vehicle traffic nightmare!    Our Community Board included in our Capital Budget Priorities and Requests a request for the construction of an elevated pedestrian overpass at this intersection.  -- To date... nothing of consequence has been done, except for the creation of a major ""bus layover/turnaround"" in front of the Kings Plaza Shopping Center causing buses, leaving the layover, to sharply cross five (5) lanes of traffic on Flatbush Avenue to turn left onto Avenue U.  The widening of the traffic islands on Flatbush Avenue has created additional confusion, danger, and further bottleneck at this dangerous intersection!  All the studies performed...All the dollars spent...All the changes suggested...All the promises made...All the time and money wasted -- To date...nothing of consequence has been done.  The problem is self-evident -- the solutions have been proposed -- implement the recommendations.       The intersection of Flatlands and Ralph Avenues continues to be problematic with constant traffic congestion and hazardous pedestrian crossings.  Traffic congestion on Ralph Avenue was exacerbated by what was projected by DOT as an engineering solution when, in fact, it complicated an already existing problem.  These recent so-called ""improvements,"" under the guise of ""Vision Zero,"" have created hardship for the motorists, pedestrians and the City's long-time landscaping nursery tenant on the corner of Ralph and Flatlands Avenues.      The MTA Select Bus Service (SBS) has failed to improve ""bus reliability"" ... the bus riders' chief complaint.  The installation of dedicated bus lanes and longer bus stops, to accommodate the longer buses, has succeeded in causing a reduction of parking spaces for homeowners, shoppers and the inability for businesses to receive curbside deliveries during peak hours.  Many of our heavily travelled roads were not designed for single-lane motor vehicle traffic, bus and bicycle lanes.      The dedicated bus lane signage is confusing to motorists and pedestrians, and should ONLY ensure the lanes remain clear during peak hours and violators fined ONLY during peak hours.   We implore the Administration to place a moratorium on new SBS routes until the MTA and DOT can provide a complete, fair and accurate analysis to include SBS reliability, peak hour ridership, ridership fare evasion or fare machine reliability, pedestrian street access, and motorist traffic flow.","","","","","Park care and maintenance","","The maintenance and upkeep of our parks and playgrounds continues to remain a major area of concern due to insufficient staffing and funding.  Some parks and playgrounds in our District are in various stages of design, scope and reconstruction.  The Board fully supports the continued funding of these projects.  Several of our smaller parks and playgrounds require reconstruction or ""in-house"" spruce-up.  We urge that these projects as well as increased staffing be addressed through the Capital and Expense Budget.  The Greenstreets Program provides us with an opportunity to beautify our barren neighborhood triangles and traffic islands.  We wholeheartedly support the continuation of this program.  Seasonal plantings must be part of the program for it to “win” broader acceptance and acclaim.  We encourage strategies for additional conservation and beautification programs.  They must include sorely needed maintenance provisions.   Parks' Department equipment and personnel are always in short supply.  We urge that our requests, as well as Departmental requests, be given a high priority in budget negotiations for adequate maintenance and operation of our parks.  The park areas within Community Board #18 provide recreational and cultural outlets for all ages and neighborhoods, and are truly a valued natural resource that must be protected and maintained.  As previously stated, Marine Park comprising 798 acres, and Canarsie Park comprising 132.2 acres, are regional facilities that serve a large population outside our local neighborhoods.    The large geographic area of our Community Board and its residential neighborhoods are also the ""home"" to the largest street tree population in the Borough.  Department of Parks and Recreation budget allocations for Forestry and Maintenance must be increased to adequately address the needs of our huge parkland and tree population. ","The maintenance, upkeep and improvement of our parks and playgrounds is a major concern, as previously stated.  ","Community Board #18 supports an enhancement, on a city-wide basis, of our world-class Cultural Institutions and Programs.  The New York City Department of Cultural Affairs (DCLA) is dedicated to supporting and strengthening New York City's vibrant cultural life. Among their primary missions is to ensure adequate public funding for non-profit cultural organizations, both large and small, throughout the five boroughs. DCLA also works to promote and advocate for quality arts programming and to articulate the contribution made by the cultural community to the City's economic vitality. The Department represents and serves non-profit cultural organizations involved in the visual, literary and performing arts; public-oriented science and humanities institutions including zoos, botanical gardens and historic and preservation societies; and creative artists at all skill levels who live and work within the City's five boroughs. Through its Materials for the Arts Program, DCLA provides free supplies for use in arts programs offered by non-profit groups and New York City public schools. DCLA has also changed the physical landscape of New York City through its Percent for Art program by commissioning more than 180 works of art by some of the world's leading artists at public building sites throughout the city.  We support their efforts and funding sources. ","Our Community Board is ""home"" to five (5) branches of the Brooklyn Public Library -- Canarsie, Flatlands, Jamaica Bay, Mill Basin, and Paerdegat.  The hours of operation must be permanently extended to provide easy access to accommodate the needs of our children and working-class population.  Funds must be allocated to inspect, upgrade and maintain these buildings to provide our residents with up-to-the-minute information, program and technical access opportunities. ","We urge the Administration to increase the budgets of Community Boards to allow for the hiring of a ""planner"" consistent with Sections 191(b)(5) and 2800(g) of the City Charter and for additional office staff in order to meet the increasing needs of the community for government access, information and programs.      Community Board #18 and Community Boards, in general, cannot perform Charter mandated responsibilities with the current meager budget allocation.","","","","","Explanation","","","","","","","","","","BK18","","","","","","","","","","",""

During this time, public and private investment of over $30 billion was made in our neighborhood. Our location at the hub of the nation's largest mass-transit network - originally built to deliver workers to the center - now works also to provide working families with a location from which they can tap into all of our region's opportunities for work, education, recreation and culture. Lower Manhattan remains a resilient place more people want to live, work and visit. We have a lot of work to do to assure that these powerful growth trends result in a district that is livable for all. This document describes the needs of our district for more schools, more open spaces, efficient transportation, less crowded streets and thorough preparation for future disasters. Our needs are great but the opportunity is immense: we can show how New York City can be the 21st Century's model city for livable, equitable and thriving urban life. Pedestrian and Streetscape Surveys In response to a pedestrian survey conducted by students at Pace University during 2014, 2015 and 2016, close to 2,000 residents, workers, tourists and students were asked to identify the most serious problems for each geographic sub-district in CD1. The results varied by neighborhood, but the overall responses ranked overcrowded sidewalks and streets, unclean subway stations, too much noise and garbage on the streets and the lack of affordable housing as the most serious issues facing the district. Too much construction and homelessness ranked not far behind the lack of affordable housing. In summary, residents, workers, tourists and students all want more affordable housing, more parks and open spaces and improved mobility and pedestrian experience in CD1. They also want less construction and all of its attendant byproducts of garbage, pollution, poor air quality and noise. People do still love to live, work, and visit lower Manhattan because a significant number of respondents said: ""Its Nice Here!"" Livability Index In July 2017 under direction of CB1 Fund for the City of New York Community Planning Fellow Jahnavi Aluri completed a year-long study of livability in our district. The study identified the factors that affect quality of life for residents in NYC neighborhoods, measured this quality of life on a scale and compared the quality of life across different NYC neighborhoods through the Livability Index to determine how Community District 1 compares to other NYC neighborhoods. Over 200 quality of life factors were analyzed in the categories of health care and human services; youth, education and child welfare; public safety; core infrastructure and city services; land use, housing and human development; transportation; and community facilities, parks and cultural. The purpose of the study was to quantify anecdotal evidence about quality of life, to better understand where CD1 performs well or poorly, and to develop actionable steps to improve quality of life issues. The Index showed that while CD1 scored generally well, it scored notably poorly in the area of Core Infrastructure and City Services, particularly due to low scores related to pollution and street conditions. Some notable factors that CD1 scored poorly on are: homelessness; quantity of public schools; air quality; noise pollution; community center capacity; street conditions; potholes; sanitation; residential stability (transient population). ","","","","","Infrastructure resiliency","","2021 marks 9 years since Superstorm Sandy which brought surges of 14 feet and numerous, serious disruptions to residents and businesses in Lower Manhattan, including power outages and loss of steam (for heat and hot water), telephone, data services and transportation, including subways which experienced flooding of tunnels. Two people were trapped by rising water and drowned. Disruptions were particularly severe in the South Street Seaport; historic buildings suffered great damage and while many businesses have reopened, some businesses and non-profit institutions are still struggling and have not fully recovered. The neighborhood surrounding the South Street Seaport was especially devastated by water up to seven feet above street level.  To date, most of the Lower Manhattan coastal areas are still left largely unprotected. The Lower Manhattan Coastal Resiliency Project includes resilience plans for 3 of the District’s 4 coastal neighborhoods, including the Fidi/Seaport Climate Resilience Master Plan, The Battery Coast Resilience Plan and the Battery Park City Resiliency Plans. Capital funds have been provided for The Battery Park City Plans and some of the Battery Plans. In October 2021, the de Blasio administration announced that it will allocate $110 million to a new capital project to help address sea level rise and storm surge in the Seaport area, but capital funds for the long-term Fidi/Seaport Climate Resilience Master Plan have not yet been secured. There are no plans or funding for research or resiliency on the West side in Tribeca and north. Additionally, the future of the Army Corps NY & NJ Harbor Tributaries Study (HATS) is still unclear. The risk for extreme weather events is only increasing and, CD1 is still left largely unprotected. The need for interim and permanent resiliency measures remains acute in CD1.  To date, there are no permanent resiliency measures in place in Community District  1. The Lower Manhattan Coastal Resiliency Project includes resilience plans  for 3 of the District’s 4 coastal neighborhoods, including the Fidi Seaport Resilience Plan, The Battery Coast Resilience Plan and the Battery Park City Resiliency Plans.  Capital funds have been provided for The Battery Park City Plans and some of the Battery Plans only.   No capital funds have been earmarked for construction for the Fidi Seaport plans.  There are no plans or funding for research for resiliency on the West side in Tribeca and north.  There are only two areas where the District has interim floor barrier measures leaving most of the coastal district exposed.   Additionally, federal funding for the Army Corps NY & NJ Harbor Tributaries Study (HATS) has been removed.  The risk for extreme weather events is only increasing and CD1 is still left unprotected.  The need for interim and permanent resiliency measures remains acute in CD 1.","Land use trends","","Within the last year, CB1 has been inundated with review of numerous projects of great impact without adequate time or resources to allow for proper and thorough review. CD1 is burdened with large-scale public and private development projects. CD1 contains the Manhattan site of the City’s Borough-Based Jails plan. CB1 adopted a resolution on Borough Based Jails in May 2019 in response to an unprecedented ULURP application spanning four sites in four different boroughs for a massive municipal works project to be completed as design-build (the first design-build project to have gone through the ULURP process). This enormous public works project will fundamentally change the fabric of its neighborhood and it will have untold impacts on the surrounding community. As design-build, most important decisions on this project will be made now that the ULURP process has concluded. Though the De Blasio administration has repeatedly promised a transparent and representative post-ULURP planning process, they have also repeatedly failed to deliver on that project and engagement has been sparse and anemic.CD1 has had several recent major ULURP applications, such as the Governors Island Rezoning and the redevelopment of 250 Water Street in the historic South Street Seaport.  CB1 finds the land use review process to be inherently flawed in a way that systematically disadvantages the community. While applicants are well-resourced and can spend months or years developing a proposal under the guidance of legal and technical experts, Community Boards are given 60 days or less to review proposals and issue recommendations. This is simply not enough time for meaningful review or consideration of major proposals such as those mentioned above, especially by a group of volunteers. Community Boards must be engaged earlier in the land use process so that their input is weighed in from the early stages of development proposals, and additional technical expertise must be made available to Community Boards in a way that allows them to fully understand and comment on land use proposals. ","Traffic","","The rapid growth of our district has been accompanied by many challenges that have been exacerbated from Covid19 with competitive uses of our streets, sidewalks and open spaces. Our growth was never properly planned for despite billions of dollars invested in residential and commercial development through public and private funding. Much of our district consists of the original colonial-era street grid characterized with narrow streets and sidewalks.  The streets were designed for people and horse traffic, not the flood of cars, motorized bikes, bicycles, trucks and buses we see today. The narrow ribbons of the historic districts in Fidi, Seaport and Tribeca are characterized with sidewalks as narrow as 1.7 feet in comparison to the modern closed street grid of the World Trade Center Campus.  Review of the Harvey Map (https://www.sidewalkwidths.nyc/#13/40.714/-74.005) using the NYC Sidewalk Data Set provides startling clarity to the difficulties of social distancing. Combined usage for approximately 15 million tourists annually, hundreds of thousands of workers daily, over 78,000 permanent residents and growing, added with the rise of homelessness, makes mobility an inherent problem.  Narrow, crowded sidewalks and giant residential towers have resulted in walls of garbage. Placard and Agency parking continue to be a major problem with both legal and illegal, given that this neighborhood is the center of the City’s government and headquarters to many City, State and Federal agencies and Courthouses. Crowding in Lower Manhattan is compounded by the sheer number of double-decker, regular and charter tour buses, personal cars and commuter buses that fill our streets. This congestion leads to critical issues such as emergency vehicles being blocked in the streets, resulting in potentially deadly increases in response times. We are encouraged by the $500,000 dedicated for a Lower Manhattan traffic/pedestrian study and the increase in dedicated bike lanes.  We are also experiencing a surge in bicycle and motorized bike traffic that often do not follow traffic rules. Furthermore, the addition of outdoor dining on sidewalks and streets has added an unplanned and studied usage. The scope is currently being developed by NYC DOT needs to pause and reconsider a complete review of all uses per street and we only hope that it results in a study that is holistic enough to capture the complex issues. Over the last 30 years our district’s population has been growing rapidly, more than doubling since the year 2000. However, despite this sustained growth, we have yet to see any planned infrastructure changes. CB1 has been tracking new residential units added to our district via new construction or remodels as a way to estimate population increase, which has illustrated a continuation of this rapid population growth. The 2020 Census confirms this trend, with our district being one of the fastest growing in the city.  In addition to the rapid overall population growth, there are specific growth trends within our child population groups. When we last analyzed census data from 2000 to 2010, we saw astonishing metrics within our population demographics for children, looking at the 0 - 19 population there was a 246% increase in the Financial District, 67% in Tribeca, and 125% in Battery Park City. While there was no net change in the Seaport/Civic Center's child population, the 0 - 4 age group increased by 57%, and the 5 - 9 age group by 44%. This trend has continued, with our under 18 population growing by 60.3% from 2010 to 2020. These changes have been massive for the district, making us the second fastest growing district in the city, for children under the age of 18. These demographic trends have grave implications for our district. There has been very little planning for infrastructure or additional open spaces. The pandemic has highlighted many of the issues around the need for larger open spaces, less crowding and density in schools, and current demand for alternate needs and uses for our sidewalks and streets. CB1 wants a more holistic review to reduce street spaces for placard and agency parking, options for refuse storage and removal that improves the sidewalks and streets and mobility throughout.","","","","","Services to reduce or prevent homelessness","","CD1 has a long history of concern for homeless people in our community. We supported John Heuss House, a drop-in facility for homeless and hungry people that was operated by Trinity Church until it closed in 2010. We also have a close relationship with the NYC Rescue Mission, which expanded its capacity in 2015 to 220 beds. The success of our efforts to reclaim the Lower Manhattan waterfront and other open spaces as community amenities requires that people are safe and secure when they visit. In this regard, it is important that all levels of government maintain acceptable funding for agencies that provide outreach and services to homeless people. We continue to receive reports of groups of homeless people in encampments in different locations in our district, both on the street/sidewalks and in the subway stations. It is important that resources are available to reach out to the people living in these locations. Recently, Manhattan Community Board 1 began dealing directly with the current mayoral administration as well as Department of Homeless Services leadership in what may be the improper siting of a permanent shelter, despite the clear methodology that is required by the NYC Charter to properly analyze the site of any kind of public facility. Community Board 1 will be closely monitoring this process. ","The largest publicly accessible medical facility in Lower Manhattan is the privately-owned New York Presbyterian - Lower Manhattan Hospital complex. Gouverneur Health is the closest municipal hospital to CD1 and some of our residents receive medical treatment there. It is located in CD3, CD1's neighbor to the northeast. In addition, Gouverneur, along with the Bellevue Hospital Center in CD6, is one of the WTC Environmental Health Centers of Excellence, which were established to address physical and mental health issues resulting from September 11, 2001. These Centers are part of the WTC Health Program, which is administered by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) which was established by the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act of 2010. The Zadroga Act was extended for 75 years by the U.S. Congress in December, 2016. CB1 advocated for this renewal in many resolutions and testimonies, and it was strongly supported by Rep. Jerrold Nadler, who represents CD1, and other U.S. Representatives and elected officials. The renewal was a very important victory for the community. We are also very concerned about the loss of hospital beds in all Lower Manhattan community districts. There has been an increase in illnesses in CB1 related to 9/11 and the community must have sufficient care facilities. Several years ago we lost St. Vincent's Hospital in Greenwich Village in CB2, which created great concern about whether remaining bed are sufficient for growing populations. The merger of Beth Israel and Mount Sinai has led to plans to very greatly reduce the number of beds at Beth Israel's hospital in CD6.  ","There is a need to recognize Naturally Occurring Retirement Communities in Community District 1. Large complexes that began their story as Mitchell-Lama developments have large concentrations of seniors and targeted programs to meet them where they are will make a large difference in mental and physical health outcomes. CB1 is especially concerned about the ability of seniors to remain and age in place in our district. Fixed incomes cannot keep pace with rapid inflation in housing costs, especially rent and property taxes, that rise as neighborhoods become more desirable. Many already considered the affordable prewar construction areas of our district to be fully gentrified and aging in place in neighborhoods that were originally built for affordability, such as Battery Park City, structured rent escalations make aging-in-place an impossibility for most. ","CD1 has a long history of concern for homeless people in our community. We supported John Heuss House, a drop-in facility for homeless and hungry people that was operated by Trinity Church until it closed in 2010. We also have a close relationship with the NYC Rescue Mission, which expanded its capacity in 2015 to 220 beds. The success of our efforts to reclaim the Lower Manhattan waterfront and other open spaces as community amenities requires that people are safe and secure when they visit.

Community Board 1 will be closely monitoring this process. ","It is a priority of CB 1 to ensure that existing rent stabilized and affordable units in the district are preserved and that development of new affordable housing units continues. We must ensure that people who teach our children, patrol our streets, and fight our fires can afford to live in the neighborhoods they serve. We therefore urge the city to build more affordable housing downtown as well as do everything possible to preserve existing units. Additionally, we voice our concern about building owners attempting to leave programs that require rents in their buildings to remain subsidized as well as the expiration of taxation incentives for stabilized apartments. We urge the City to do everything possible to ensure that Lower Manhattan remains a diverse community that is affordable to people in a wide range of income levels and demographic groups. This issue is further complicated by the unique governance structure that oversees buildings within Battery Park City. There are a number of affordable units within the area under the Batter Park City Authority and we call upon HPD to work with the Authority to preserve existing affordable units there. ","","","","","School and educational facilities (Capacity)","","A priority issue in our district in recent years had been the development of new school seats to serve our rapidly growing population of young people. We therefore welcomed the announcement in December 2015 by the School Construction Authority that it would build a new 476-seat K-5 school at 77 Greenwich Street. But, the Department of Education has only provided half the 1,000 seats promised to the community. In addition, we need funds to create another high school that operates with the same model as Millennium High School. The New York Assembly Harbor School on Governors island and Lower Manhattan Community Middle School are in need of expansion to full achieve the promise of their unique programming.","Construct the sufficient number of school seats in CB1 in the next 5-year capital plan to meet the need resulting from the rapid growth in the population of our district in recent years. Class sizes must be brought back to Blue Book density guidelines as researched and documented by the local CEC. ","As a growing residential community, CD1 needs additional active and passive indoor and outdoor recreational space including ballfields. This issue remains a top priority for CB1, and with so little active recreation space available in Lower Manhattan, we are forced to search for available fields outside of our district to accommodate our growing population of children and the resulting growth in sports leagues. Community sports are important for the development of youth and sense of community. We also need additional funding for after-school programs. Child Welfare has never been brought to the board as a standing issue to be addressed. The pandemic continues to weaken our local providers and much research will be necessary to reasses the state of services when social distancing is no longer required. ","","","","","Traffic violations and enforcement","","In order to continue to thrive, our community must remain secure and retain the quality of life valued by its residents and workers. In recent years the crime rate in our district has remained at reasonably low levels aside from what is hopefully a temporary rise in burglaries, grand larceny and grand theft auto, however, we cannot take for granted that this will continue. In addition to preventing and responding to crimes against people and property, we rely on the NYPD as well as other enforcement agencies to control quality of life problems in our busy mixed-use district, which is also a major tourist destination. These issues include idling buses, illegal placard parking, double-parking, unsafe vehicle operation, homelessness, vendors, and improper use of human-powered and electric bicycles on sidewalks and greenways. Dangerous intersections remain a primary concern for our district. Crossing guards are especially important near schools and CB1 has advocated along with our elected officials for guards to protect the schoolchildren who cross at such intersections. The NYPD has been responsive in recent months and has provided protection for children at these locations until permanent guards can be placed there. Off Street parking for official and personal NYPD vehicles may be necessary to end the NYPD practice of creating improvised fortress environments as a response to perceived and credible threats.","CB1 identified numerous and significant needs in the area of public safety. The NYPD has developed a WTC Campus Security Plan to restrict and regulate traffic at the perimeters of the site. Although we are concerned about creating a fortress- like presence in our community, CB1 is working with the NYPD, local leaders and stakeholders to find the right balance between safety considerations and livability so that the area will be thriving and vibrant, commercially successful as well as secure. We also strongly recommend that to the greatest extent possible, where safety concerns allow, areas closed after September 11, 2001 be re-opened to the public. We have worked with Friends of City Hall Park to increase public access to restricted parts of City Hall Park. Comparable ways to safely reopen Park Row are necessary to relieve severe burdens placed on nearby residents and businesses by restrictions associated with 1 Police Plaza. We are encouraged that the City has allowed Park Row to be re-opened to pedestrians and cyclists, but to the extent possible, we are interested in having Park Row re-opened and re-integrated into street grid. In addition to crime against people and property, CD1 also has many significant quality of life problems. We rely on the NYPD as well as other agencies for enforcement to keep these problems under control. Our district is a destination for many double-decker as well as commuter and tour buses. These generate complaints about idling, blocking sidewalks and street crossings, and other disruptive activity. Enforcement in this area by the NYPD, NYC DOT, DEP and other relevant agencies such as the agency that issues their permits, the NYC Department of Consumer Affairs, must continue. Other quality of life problems that occur excessively in our district include the abuse of placard parking. CB1 is home to many government agency offices and facilities, and enforcement is needed to keep under control the chronic and acute problem with government- authorized vehicles occupying limited space for parking and taking up spaces needed by emergency service and commercial vehicles. We also need to address the homeless situation discussed elsewhere by providing adequate and appropriate services for this vulnerable population.  ","Currently, the only impediments that CB 1 identifies as potentially hurting response times to 911 calls is non-standard jurisdictional boundaries and awkwardly stored street names in the various EMS databases. Lower Manhattan has a number of oddly abbreviated street names, which may be difficult for operators to identify if the are not familiar with a caller referring to them in a different form. Three such cases are South William Street, North End Avenue, and South End Avenue, which are commonly abbreviated as S William Street, N End Avenue and S End Avenue respectively. That South William Street and William Street are so close and the former is far more obscure than the latter is not an infrequent issue. South End and North End avenues are in Battery Park City, which is largely under the jurisdiction of the Battery Park City Authority (BPCA) have proven to be challenging for EMS operators to locate during calls. Furthermore, emergencies within parks that are in the jurisdiction of the BPCA are not New York State parks, nor are they New York City parks. They are something else entirely and do not have an established way for those who call for emergency services to direct arrival to specific locations within those areas in the same way that Central Park has numbered light poles, as an example. ","","","","","Protective infrastructure (sea walls, flood walls, etc.)","","At a height of seven feet, CB1 experienced one of the highest inundation levels in Manhattan during Superstorm Sandy. Two people in our district drowned and we suffered extreme damage to residential and commercial property, tunnels, public transit, telecommunications and our electrical grid. CB1 has played an active and positive role in the public process of recovery, resiliency and sustainability since Superstorm Sandy. Lower Manhattan is in immediate need of resiliency and hardening measures. It has been nearly a decade since Sandy and we are concerned about both the short-term and long-term time frame. Lower Manhattan remains largely unprotected while we face an increasing potential for suffering extreme weather events and subsequent damage. New York City has a combined sewer and storm water system. During heavy rain and snow storms, combined sewers receive higher than normal flows. According to the NYC Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), treatment plants are unable to handle flows more than twice design capacity and when this occurs, a mix of sea level rise, excess stormwater, and untreated wastewater discharges directly into the City’s waterways at certain outfalls. This is called a combined sewer overflow (CSO). We are concerned about CSOs because of their effect on water quality and recreational uses. ","There is an ongoing need to mitigate the negative impact of dozens of major public and private construction projects in the approximately 1.5 square miles of CB1 to assure a healthy quality of life. Inspection of construction sites to monitor and regulate dust, noise, air pollution and safety is needed daily including weekends as deliveries of supplies and removal of debris are shifted to off hours to avoid peak traffic congestion. CB1 encourages the use of greenscaping throughout the District with the addition of green parklets, trees, greenbelts and bio swales. Helicopters, specifically those catering to tourists, cause innumerable quality of life issues for our district including environmental concerns like noise and air pollution. There have been inroads in lessening the effects of air traffic, but CB1 asks that the City be vigilant in continuing work toward the goal of eliminating all helicopter tourism. ","The increase in our district's residential population and associated commercial activity has significantly increased the amount of garbage on our streets. The 9/11 Memorial along with the Statue of Liberty, The Battery, African Burial Ground, Federal Hall and other tourist attractions also put pressure on sanitation. It is important that the Sanitation Department be given the resources that it needs to ensure that the streets in our district are kept clean. Resources should also be increased to address the proliferation of vermin in Lower Manhattan. Mounds of plastic trash bags often clutter narrow streets during both day and night and are unsightly and a health hazard as well as an impediment to pedestrians. The frequency of garbage pick-ups needs to be increased. The number of days when there are piles of refuse on the street is increased because there are separate days for pickup of recyclables and trash and residential and commercial waste. When new buildings are built or old buildings are converted, the design process should take into consideration where the residents' garbage will go and how it will be picked up. The landmarked street grid of the Financial District has narrow sidewalks and streets, making it difficult and unpleasant to navigate areas congested with piles of garbage and waste left out for recycling. The addition of the Open Restaurants Program has added to the congestion of the sidewalks and streets while not addressing sanitation needs. CB1 has joined together with a group of community stakeholders to advocate for a managed street plan in Lower Manhattan to better handle a variety of issues pertaining to vehicular, pedestrian and cyclist mobility with a large focus on sanitation. Our priorities are to ensure that the overarching scope is appropriate and assesses critical areas like sanitation. It is imperative to the continued growth and economic development of this community that the City use the mobility study to develop and recommend to the community a set of specific and implementable measures to address the congestion challenges, mainly including the trash piles. The Department of Sanitation must also explore alternatives to storing residential trash on the sidewalk. Many cities around the world have invested in capital projects to store trash both above and below curb lanes and not within the pedestrian rights-of-way. The availability of the curb lanes and sidewalk space has been further diminished with the permanent Open Restaurant Program which increases the need for more frequent sanitation collection. Lastly, the rate of commercial to residential conversions in Lower Manhattan is not slowing and the amount of trash that will end up on the sidewalk will only increase over time. ","","","","","Land use and zoning","","CD1 is not adequately stocked with existing affordable housing, nor does it have many opportunities to generate new affordable units. Existing zoning for much of the financial district is already set to the maximum residential density as allowed by state law. The balance of the district is either within a historic district, special zoning district regulations, or is under the jurisdiction of the Battery Park City Authority. There are simply not enough emerging units for area residents who are being pushed out of their homes as buildings exit older affordability programs such as Mitchell-Lama or other tax-levied conveyances. We caution our sister agencies against pursuing a larger-scale zoning strategy before fully exploring other economic development options such as Economic Opportunity Zones are their equivalent, should the pandemic relief picture develop such pathways to jumpstart the lagging local economy. CB1 is a rapidly changing district with dramatic increases in population, facing an enormous amount of construction, is still recovering from Superstorm Sandy and will now face untold changes due to COVID19. The loss of small businesses was already of great concern to all residents and after COVID the picture has become catastrophically grim. CB1 supports small business and believes that it is important for merchant’s associations like the Tribeca Alliance Partnership to receive support from the city in resources and attention. Given the residential and office population density of our district, we are not well served by small commercial units that best serve local retail establishments. Regional retail is expanding within the district and without more opportunities for inexpensive retail, small businesses will continue to be pushed out.","Decades-long increases in the numbers of residents, office workers and tourists have significantly increased the density of our district. This has heightened concerns about infrastructure capacity, including overcrowded streets and sidewalks, resiliency, public school seats, public transportation capacity, open spaces, and much more. Our waterfront remains particularly vulnerable. CB1 has discussed various ways to handle these infrastructure issues, including studying the related mobility issues, creating zoning rules to deal with how new developments can help internalize some of the impacts, concepts of a capital ""impact fund"" to pay for needed critical infrastructure in the district, etc. Many recently completed large developments in the CB1 area as well as those underway will add to this pressure. Earlier we described the immense impact of several new projects (Borough Based Jails/Manhattan Detention Complex, Governors Island and 250 Water Street/South Street Seaport). Already a community out of balance, these significant developments will continue to put incalculable strain on community facilities and infrastructure. ","The rapid and continuing growth of the population of CD1 in recent decades has created significant challenges. Since 9/11, our district's population has been increasing rapidly. The U.S. Census documented a 77% growth between 2000 and 2010 from 34,420 to 60,978, a trend that has continued into 2020 as the district remains the fastest growing in Manhattan.In comparison, the entire population of New York City increased only 2% during the same time period. Since the last Decennial Census, our Board has been tracking the addition of new residential units to estimate increased population using a proven methodology. The rate at which new residential units are added to our district indicates that this growth trend continues. Since 2010, at least 10,000 new residential units have been added or are planned for our district, and there has been a major demographic shift from unrelated singles to couples, families and children, with our under 18 population having grown by over 60% since 2010. CD1's rapidly growing residential population and the ongoing addition of residential units to the district's housing stock create a unique set of housing challenges in Lower Manhattan. After 9/11, incentives for the development of housing units in Lower Manhattan spurred a boom in residential conversions, and development remains strong today. However, community infrastructure falls woefully short in meeting the needs of this considerable residential growth. As a result, CB1's top priorities include more school seats, community centers and resources for seniors. As a district with many ongoing construction projects, CD1 has extensive sidewalk sheds, scaffolding, detours, and other construction-related impacts. Scaffolding is a particular blight on our district, as City laws make it very easy for property owners to renew permits that enable them to keep it in place indefinitely, creating circulation and safety issues and hindering economic development by blighting blocks with conditions unfriendly to retail and commercial businesses. CD1 also strongly supports the retaining existing affordable housing units in the district and developing as many new affordable units as possible. This has traditionally been a community with a diversity of income levels and a strong middle class, and government at all levels should do everything it can to keep this important demographic diversity. ","Lower Manhattan has long served as a unique tourist destination, as it is rich in iconic historical, cultural, and economic assets. We receive approximately 15 million tourists annually. Small businesses, or ""mom and pop"" operations are very important to our District. Supporting and preserving them are of great importance to our Board. CD1 has seen dramatic changes in our business population during COVID19 response and recovery. CD1 is unique in that it has a disproportionate number of workers, students and tourists that may visit the district by day but do not live here permanently. Now that many workers and students are remote and tourism is still recovering, many businesses who were reliant on that traffic have now closed their doors. CB1 is working tirelessly with our elected officials, city agencies and advocacy groups to support businesses in our district that have managed to remain, and to incentivize long-term recovery and growth. However, we cannot understate the dire situation among our business community. The current needs greatly outweigh available resources and we still have a long way to go in stabilizing our business community. ","","","","","Traffic congestion","","In Lower Manhattan, narrow streets, a large number of ongoing public and private construction projects, vehicular and pedestrian conflict and crowded public transportation present many challenges. Much work needs to be done to ensure that our streets are safe and accessible to all. We are in a period of transition following the implementation of the City's bike share program and the opening of the Fulton Transit Center and the WTC Transportation hub, but we still have many significant challenges and areas of interest such as the need to better regulate commercial cyclists, improve subway and ferry service, further restrict tourist helicopters, and implement a one-seat ride to the airport and build an extension to Lower Manhattan of the 2nd Avenue Subway line. With regards to congestion pricing, we ask that the NYC Department of Transportation take care that revenue profile of congestion pricing is not built upon the backs of the residents of Community District 1.","While Lower Manhattan has plans for transportation improvements, all efforts must be made to protect one of its most valuable assets - its dense transportation network. All efforts must be made to make subways, bus routes, tunnels/underpasses, the Brooklyn Bridge, ferries and docks resilient to extreme weather events. Billions of dollars of existing investment must be hardened. Currently underway are three major tunnel repairs due to Sandy: the Hugh L. Carey Tunnel (formerly Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel), the South Ferry Station and the Battery Park Underpass. These repairs are costly, take years to complete and add to commuter travel time.

","","","","","Park access and park facility access","","Quality parks are essential to the mental and physical well-being of community residents and strengthen resiliency to storms and extreme climate events. CD1 lacks sufficient active and recreational space to meet the needs of its rapidly growing population. In July 2011, CB1 documented this inadequacy in a report which found that there are approximately 3.5 million square feet of open and park space in our district. However, the analysis conducted for the report concluded that a large portion of this open space does not serve the community, is not accessible, and does not facilitate active recreation. Therefore it is extremely important that the parkland we have is of the highest quality possible and that as much new parkland and open space as possible be developed in CD1. The opening of the Hills on Governor's Island brought an important new amenity to the district. CB1 has long advocated for the development of public open space on Governor's Island as a resource for residents of CD1 and elsewhere.","CB1 has some important needs associated with our existing parks and open spaces. The Battery is a vibrant part of the CD1 waterfront. Its beauty and integrity must be maintained particularly in light of the city resiliency plans for the Battery Wharf and the adjacent Pier A Plaza and BPCA's Wagner Park. Money must be allocated to assure that the new plans for the Battery and Wagner Park work seamlessly with the existing and proposed designs of the park, the roadways, new access points, bike lanes, concessions, public buildings etc. In the Battery, the City must step up enforcement to continue to work to curtail the ticket sellers and hawkers. Open space on the east side of Lower Manhattan is in short supply, though the CB is grateful for completion of the East River Esplanade. Additional funds will be needed to fully implement the comprehensive waterfront interim protection from Wall Street south along the East River. CB1 urges NYC EDC , Department of City Planning, DEP and DOT to complete the Barnett Newman Triangle,(promised since 2010), and to identify additional funds to research the greening of the space under the Brooklyn Bridge. ","The East Side of our community, which includes the South Street Seaport/Civic Center and Financial District, has radically transformed into a thriving mixed-use community with a large residential population. To date, the densely populated area does not have a community center, public library or other public recreational facility. The South Street Seaport Museum has been unable to open its galleries at 12-14 Fulton St. because of damage to the electrical systems from Sandy. Exhibits can't be mounted in rooms that are not correctly heated and air conditioned. The Museum needs to keep both its land-based premises and its ships to tell the story of how New York began and grew as a great port. They are an important cultural hub in a historic district that is unique in New York City. We also strongly support creation of the WTC Performing Arts Center (PAC) at the World Trade Center. This major new cultural center will provide needed arts programming in Lower Manhattan and also create construction and long term jobs and promote the economic revitalization of the neighborhood. The Manhattan Youth Downtown Community Center in Tribeca serves people of all ages and has developed programs in response to evolving community needs. In addition, the Asphalt Green community center and the community center at Stuyvesant High School, both in Battery Park City, serve our growing community. We need to ensure that all such facilities in CD1 receive needed funding to provide places where children and teenagers can play, learn, and grow; where our seniors can socialize and find needed resources and intellectual stimulation; and where all adults can pursue personal enrichment through fitness and continuing education. These existing facilities serve as models for what is needed east of Broadway as well. ","The population in Lower Manhattan has grown rapidly and continues to increase. Though the majority of the recent population growth has occurred east of Broadway, the Financial District and Seaport areas are still without a public library branch. A new library is needed to serve the many new residents in these areas. It is also important that our existing libraries in Battery Park City and on Murray Street receive sufficient resources to meet the needs of our growing population, and that funds are allocated to ensure that these libraries are open at times when residents and children need them most. ","Community boards are charged with ensuring service delivery and protecting quality of life for those who live, work in, and visit our many districts. Furthermore, community boards often take the lead on amplifying important issues and shining a light on matters that might otherwise be missed. Over the years, community boards have grown in responsibilities while seeing their budgets remain stagnant. Community Board 1 is an incredibly important node for discussion that brings together federal, state and local governments to have important conversations about complex topics. Currently, CB 1s Environmental Protection Committee is operating like a local town hall to bring the New York State Department of Environmental Protection together with vulnerable populations to discuss brownfield remediation in the Seaport Area. The Quality of Life Committee provides a way for district residents and business owners to coordinate with utilities and the Department of Design & Construction to mitigate impacts, but also save the city money by improving the planning around these projects. The common theme is that the CB 1 office has the responsibility to engage with the stakeholders, private industry, and government to make this possible. Community Boards are the only city agencies that are based on geographies as opposed to a scope of work, it makes sense to allow each board to specialize its staffing strategy to meet geographic needs. Currently, the budget barely permits boards to have enough staff to keep the office running and sustain the charter-mandated goals. An increase in our budget to allow boards to hire specialized staff would allow us to expand our reach and further improve coordination between community and government as well as coordination between levels of government.

Home to some of the most valuable residential and commercial real estate in the Country and residents of notable affluence, not all of CB2's residents share in the affluence for which it is renowned, and the District also remains home to those who witnessed the explosion of property values and income levels without participating in them.  The District is also challenged by the presence and unmet needs of a significant population of chronically unhoused residents.  The District also is at the forefront of rapidly evolving changes in our society.  The first licensed cannabis dispensary under the State's programs to legalize recreational marijuana use is located in our District, as are two additional dispensaries licensed under the portion of the legalization program that focus on dispensaries operated either by not-for-profits or those previously involved in the justice system due to non-violent marijuana offenses.  In the Fall of 2023, the State rushed to expand the potential availability of dispensary licenses to a broader group of would-be licensees, our District was again at the fore, with over 75 applications competing for limited spaces and opportunities.  Developing procedures and criteria to evaluate and make recommendations on this flood of applications while upholding the equity and social justice impetus for the legalization legislation occasioned the creation of CB2' Cannabis Licensing Committee as a separate standing committee.  That Committee is continuing to develop means to overcome at-best unclear directives in order to fulfill the intent of the State legislation.  The end of the Covid state of emergency declarations is continuing to have multiple impacts on the District as well as the City beyond.  During the 3 years of the Covid state of emergency, pursuant to City Council legislation, the City Department of Transportation (""DoT"") initiated an outdoor dining program built upon a series of general guidelines for the use of sidewalks and, for the first time, roadways as spaces for serving patrons of restaurants, bars and other hospitality industry establishments.  The use of the sidewalks and roadways during the COvid-era outdoor dining regime included a wide variety of structures ranging from traditional sidewalk seating to fully enclosed structures, all of which were allowed to be constructed and to remain in place based on self-certification by the sponsoring establishment that the structures conformed to the DoT's rules and guidelines, even where non-compliance was manifest.    The use of the sidewalks and roadways during the Covid state of emergency was inaugurated as a means to rescue the hospitality industry in the wake of the initial government-required shutdown of virtually all businesses and all entertainment and tourist activities in the Spring and Summer of 2020.  The use of the sidewalks and roadways continued under this scheme as part of the continuing efforts to rebuild the City's economy.    As the recovery continued, increasing attention has been paid to the impact of the manner in which the sidewalk and roadway cafes impacted the surrounding community.  For example, the effects of the uses of sidewalks and roadways increasingly raised concerns about noise, trash, vermin infestation and pedestrian and vehicular access based on the presence of sidewalk and roadway structures.  These concerns were amplified in our District, whose charm and challenge can be defined by the width of our streets and sidewalks creating narrower than usual passages than other parts of Manhattan or our City.  Reports of the inability of emergency vehicles and larger delivery and carting trucks to navigate the slalom required to navigate narrow streets with roadway sheds have grown more frequent.  In addition, many sidewalk and roadway enclosures remained in place, albeit in increasingly dilapidated condition, after the sponsoring restaurant of establishment ceased to operate, creating both eyesores and havens for vermin.  With the passage of Local Law 121 of 2023, the Mayor and the City Council have embarked our City upon a permanent program of outdoor dining, to be known as ""Dining Out NYC.""  The regulations that will implement that law and establish key definitions, requirements and templates for the permanent use of the sidewalks and roadways for hospitality are under review as this statement goes to press,    Unlike the Covid-era program, use of the sidewalks and roadways will require a revocable consent and a license from DoT.  As documented in the District Needs Statements of previous years, CB2 is the District with the single highest number of outdoor dining structures during the Covid-era temporary program.  There is every reason to believe that CB2 will again lead the City in applications for sidewalk and roadway cafe licenses under Dining Out NYC.  CB2 will thus need to adapt and process a flood of such applications, along with an impending flood of applications for licenses to serve alcohol, beer and wine in such cafes.  An internal challenge is also being faced by CB2 and all Community Boards as a result of the end of the state of emergency declarations by the Mayor and Governor.  Community Boards are subject to the State Open Meetings Law (found in sections 100-111 of the New York State Public Officers Law, hereafter the ""OML"").  One key requirement of the OML even after recent amendments is that, in order to convene a meeting of a public body (defined to include Community Boards), at least a quorum of the body's members meet in person at a venue accessible to the public (with certain exceptions for the participation of members with qualifying disabilities).  The end of the state of emergency declarations also ended the suspension of the OML that allowed Community Boards and other bodies to meet virtually such as over the Zoom, Webex, Google Meet, or Microsoft Teams platforms.    While opinions vary widely as to whether in-person or virtual meetings are to be preferred, for example pitting the broader reach to a wider swath of the public for virtual meetings against the more personal and more collegial tenor of in-person gatherings, it is universally accepted that attempting to accommodate both - in-person meetings of the Board Members with remote access by the public - creates unique challenges ranging from the sophistication of hardware to effect such transmission (and of the personnel to operate it), to the infrastructure resident in venues used for the in-person portion of the meeting.  Those challenges are drawn into stark relief with respect to Community Boards, who are subject to the requirements to hold in person meetings that are available for broadcast or live streaming, without being provided with a dedicated conforming venue from which to convene such meetings.  In addition to these societal and governmental challenges, the residents and service providers living and operating in CB2 continue to struggle to meet the needs and address the impacts of those who suffer from severe mental illness, those who are chemically addicted, those who are chronically unhoused (with significant perceived overlaps among those populations), as well as those who prey upon these vulnerable populations.  The persistence of incidents of aggressive behavior toward residents, businesses, students and tourists, among many others, occasionally resulting in tragedies but always impacting the ability to feel safe and be safe, form a troubling counterpoint to the success of law enforcement to reduce the incidence of more serious index crimes such as murder, arson, felony assault and grand larceny.  There is much work ahead to build and rebuild a sustainable community.  DISTRICT OVERVIEW  A. Geography  Community Board 2 is a diverse district, bounded on the north by 14th Street, the south by Canal Street, the east by the Bowery/Fourth Avenue, and the west by the Hudson River. It is a unique and rapidly expanding community that includes the vibrant neighborhoods of Little Italy, part of Chinatown, SoHo, NoHo, Nolita, Greenwich Village, the West Village, Gansevoort Market, the South Village and Hudson Square.  B. Population  The population of Community Board 2 has been steadily rising since 2010, with an estimated population of 92,445, according to the 2020 Census, which is an increase of 2.7% since 2010. While there was some concern that the COVID-19 pandemic would result in a decrease in population, the 2020 Census indicates those concerns may have been unfounded.  It should also be noted that the five major universities in the district - New York University, the New School, the Cooper Union, Hebrew Union College, and Cardozo Law School typically add a substantial non-permanent population to our neighborhoods, which are returning to occupancy in the post-pandemic world.  With both NYU and The New School continuing to expand, we expect the student populations to grow further in the years ahead. While the students that join us every year are welcome, it is clear that the city needs to consider their numbers when looking to allocate services to Community District 2.  C. Income structure  Much of the architecture and history of our district has been maintained by residents who are determined to preserve the middle class, live-work, merchant and artisan atmosphere of our neighborhoods, past and future, but socioeconomic patterns are changing drastically. According to the 2015 - 2019 American Community Survey (ACS), the median income for District 2 was $127,116, while the poverty rate was 8.0% and the unemployment rate was 2.8%.  The gap between those who define the affluence of our Community, and those who witness that gorwth of affluence without any direct participation in or benefit from it, is expected to continue to widen.  D. Housing  In recent years, the median monthly rent in District 2 increased to the highest in the City at $2,311, according to the 2015 - 2019 ACS with 39% of renters in Community District 2 considered rent burdened (spent at least 30% of household income on rent) and 18.5% of renters in Community District 2 considered severely rent burdened (spent more than 50% of household income on rent).   E.  Public Health  In addtion to the needs identified in the following section on Health and Human Services, our community board continues to work diligently with the World Trade Center Environmental Health Center&#39;s Community Advisory Council to pass federal legislation that would provide permanent funding for this center along with the other centers dedicated to those affected by 9/11. In the interim, it is important that the City continue its funding and support of these centers.  We are very interested in ensuring that the number of new HIV infections in the City decreases and that those living with HIV and AIDS receive the services they need to remain healthy and to have stable living environments. It is essential that the City fund - and advocate forcefully with the State and Federal governments to fund - new methods to help prevent new infections, research into how to effectively reach the populations that are seeing higher infection rates, and support for the non-profit service providers who are the best responders to the epidemic and yet are losing government funding.  F. Tourism/Visitors  The proliferation of bars, restaurants and other hospitality venues, combined with world-class entertainment and cultural resources and equally renown institutions of higher learning, have enabled Community District 2 to rebound from the brutal economic consequences of the government-mandated shutdown during the early stages of the Covid pandemic.  Balancing those positive impacts on the local economy, as well as the enhanced safety created by vibrant life on our streets, against the negative externalities of the recovery in order to build a fully sustainable new community model is the next and on-going challenge to be met by the community, to which the Community Board is committed to contributing.   G.  Resilience  CD2 is a coastal district, with over a mile of waterfront along the Hudson River and over 10,000 residents living within the FEMA 0.2% chance floodplain. The district was impacted by Superstorm Sandy in 2012, with a portion of the district being inundated by floodwaters, causing significant property damage. As sea levels are projected to continue rising in the coming decades, storm-surge related risks are expected to increase.  Additionally, in summer and fall of 2021, as well as in several instances during the summer and fall of 2023, a series of heavy rain events resulted in significant flooding across much of the city. The effects of climate change are likely to increase the frequency of such events in the future.  The US Army Corps of Engineers (""USACE"") has recently released a study of the NY-NJ area which includes resiliency recommendations which fall within CD2. However, due to the complexity of overlapping jurisdictions within the floodplain along the Hudson, CB2 believes a more comprehensive, localized study of resiliency and flood risk along the West Side may need to be undertaken that incorporates the wide range of relevant stakeholders including the Community Boards, City agencies (DOT and DEP), State agencies (DOT and DEC), relevant utilities such as Consolidated Edison, and the Hudson River Park Trust. Additionally, with the growing combined risk of coastal and rainwater flooding, CB2 encourages the city to continue working with community stakeholders to develop an overall plan for resiliency within the district (including but not limited to coastal protection), which could include, among other things, greater investment in green infrastructure. Additionally, it is crucial that any allocation of funding for resiliency projects within CD2, as well as the specific design elements of such projects, be coordinated with significant local community review and input, from the earliest planning stages through the completion of such projects.  H.  Environment and Sanitation  New residents, replacing the manufacturers who previously hired private carters, must now rely on collection by the NYC Sanitation Department. With the reopening of international travel and the end of COVID-19 restrictions, tourism is expected to return to pre-pandemic levels and further straining sanitation services. Sanitation District 2&#39;s limited staff is hard pressed to meet the community&#39;s growing needs as the area has increasingly become home to a twenty-four hour population. In particular, the agency's decision a few years ago to cut the number of supervisors in each district has made it more difficult to clean the streets as thoroughly as they had been cleaned in the past.  While the city has restored many cuts made to sanitation services during COVID-19, sanitation does not adequately service corner garbage bins that see increased usage in many areas from weekend use especially from to go food and drink containers.  The advent of roadside dining has also created impacts on local residential trash pickups and missed collections and roadside dining structures are anticipated to have significant impacts on snow removal operations throughout CB2, in particular on narrow streets and areas where there are multiple eating and drinking establishments on the same block.  We are pleased the City has dedicated significant resources and is now taking a pro-active approach in combating the rat population in our City. In particular, we applaud the Rat Indexing Initiative. We urge the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene and particularly the Parks Department to continue these aggressive efforts and to coordinate these efforts to address the recent increase in the rat population due to the growth of the Temporary Open Restaurant program. Additionally, we encourage the city to continue with the expansion of programs that have the potential to further combat the increase in rats as well as improve the overall sanitation situation in CD2, such as ""clean curbs"" style containerization programs, containerized curbside composting, and more frequent pickups of residential waste and corner bins.  Light pollution is another environmental concern which has been growing in severity over the last few years. New methods of advertising including LED lights, neon signs, bright television screens displayed in windows, vehicles serving as ""moving billboards"" with LED signs attached, and ads projected onto the sides of buildings, can all be found frequently throughout CD2. Many of these advertisements are already against DOB / DOT rules and should be subject to enforcement from these agencies.  I.  Sidewalks, Street Activities and Pedestrian Plazas  -- Sidewalks  As the City's outdoor dining program transitions into a permanent one in early 2023, it has the potential to severely impact the quality of life for residents in the community amid permanent decisions being made during a pandemic with unknown long term consequences. CB2 requests the opportunity to review and provide detailed input on the permanent outdoor dining program, details of which are expected to be laid out in the coming months.  COVID-19 has dramatically increased the pressure on sidewalk access and usage. The existing sidewalk caf&eacute; regime that existed prior to COVID-19 that was administered by the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection was suspended during the onset of the pandemic. In June, CB2 provided a comprehensive set of recommendations to both the Mayor and City Council with an extensive set of suggestions related to exploring new outdoor dining options. In the summer of 2020 and 2021, with the advent of several outdoor dining initiatives under the auspices of the Department of Transportation, new semi-permanent build outs were created in roadbeds and to some extent on the sidewalk. As we enter the third winter with COVID-19 still prominent, the dramatic proliferation in a short period of time of full structures on both the sidewalk and in roadbeds where none had previously existed has significantly changed and impacted the use of sidewalks in our community with rampant illegal uses allowed to proliferate as a result of a lack of any uniform enforcement or clear guidance.  CB2 Manhattan continues to see more pressure on sidewalk access and usage. The list of incursions grows as businesses try ever harder to differentiate themselves, particularly in the current economic conditions. The sidewalks are often home to sidewalk cafes, newsstands, sidewalk vendors, food truck crowds, benches, A-frame signs and other items taking pedestrian and open space, often illegally.  Community District 2 is an extremely popular area for tourists and tri-state visitors and the relatively narrow width of many of our sidewalks, especially on side streets, can lead to intense congestion that often forces people to walk in the streets, which is undesirable and unsafe. The incursions mentioned above, both legal and illegal, contribute to the problem.  These situations often create unsanitary conditions, limit or make pedestrian access treacherous in what is public right-of-way, and create an uneven playing field that encourages responsible establishments to break the rules as well, if only to compete with their opportunistic neighbors.  -- Street Activities  CB2 probably hosts more street fairs, block parties, etc. than any other district in the city. Although street fairs are a longstanding tradition in our neighborhoods, there are too many generic, promoter-based multi-block events that have no indigenous relationship to our neighborhoods. These long multi-block events take business away from the merchants who pay rent and taxes, and generally detract from the quality of life of our residents. We appreciate that there is a citywide moratorium on new multi-block fairs, but we urge the City to look for ways to better ensure sponsors are indeed functional organizations and are viable members of the immediate community.  CB2 remains disturbed by the endless proliferation of promotional and commercial events, some permitted and some not, which are occurring regularly in SoHo and, to a lesser extent, in NoHo. These events clog sidewalks and streets and often result in chaotic street scenes costing the City money and resources as it struggles to bring order to the mayhem. Residents are inconvenienced and neighboring businesses are hurt as temporary ""pop-up"" shops commandeer the sidewalks, close streets and often blast music that illegally impacts the quality of life of the neighbors. The City needs to focus on this growing problem and come up with ways to successfully address and contain it.  CB2 values the opportunity to review proposed street activities during our monthly meetings. However, under current SAPO policy, it is possible for certain street event applications to be submitted fewer than 30 days prior to the proposed event (in some cases as little as 10 or 15 days ahead of the event) which means there is no way for CB2 to review such events. While understanding that some of these short-dated applications are minor, CB2 wants to ensure that we have the opportunity to review any event that could have a significantly impact on Quality of Life for the surrounding residents.  -- Pedestrian Plazas  Community District 2 is home to three pedestrian plazas that were created under the Department of Transportation&#39;s Plaza Program; Gansevoort Plaza (Plaza Partner-Meatpacking BID), Astor Place (Plaza Partner-Village Alliance), and Cooper Square (Plaza Partner-Grace Church School). Recently, Community Board 2 has received applications from the Street Activity Permit Office (SAPO) for large, long-duration commercial events within the pedestrian plazas. The substantial event fees paid by the applicants is used by each BID to provide enhanced maintenance and programming of the pedestrian plazas and the City receives substantial revenue, as well. The Plaza Program was created to provide ""vibrant, accessible public spaces and walkable destinations"" for the community. Programming is intended to make the plazas vibrant centers of activity and should include activities such as holiday events, food or craft markets, temporary public art installations or exhibits, and music and dancing. Pursuant to Plaza Program requirements, advertising is not permitted in the plazas. However, the Gansevoort Pedestrian Plaza, in particular, has seen a proliferation of events from corporate entities like Disney, Netflix, Dior, Kate Spade, and more. Often, the events continue for multiple days and feature an abundance of branding and advertising. In certain instances, SAPO has approved commercial events even after the Community Board recommended denial because of the over-commercialization of public space. Community Board 2 will continue to monitor the use of our pedestrian plazas, especially to prevent advertising which is not permitted in the plazas pursuant to Plaza Program requirements.             ","","","","","Affordable Housing","","#3:  Create and Preserve Affordable Housing in our District CB2 remains committed to protecting and preserving the affordable housing that we have and supporting opportunities to build affordable housing where practicable and appropriate. We urge the city to increase direct city investment in 100% affordable housing construction, adaptive reuse of existing buildings, and revise requirements that mandate far greater numbers of affordable housing units with lower median incomes and fewer loopholes than currently under the city’s Mandatory Inclusionary Housing program Current Affordable Housing Stock in CB2. We are already home to thousands of affordable housing units of various types. Among them are traditional rent stabilized units, Joint Live-Work Quarters for Artists (JLWQA) units in rent stabilization, Interim Multiple Dwelling (IMD) units currently under the supervision of the Loft Board, previous IMD loft units that are now rent stabilized, Mitchell Lama housing units and project-based Section-8 buildings. Rent stabilized units can be found in great  numbers throughout CB2 in almost all of our neighborhoods including in Greenwich Village, the West Village, South Village, SoHo, NoHo, Little Italy, Nolita and Chinatown, and to a lesser extent in the Meatpacking District, Union Square South, and Hudson Square. The passage of the Housing Stability and Tenant Protections Act of 2019 strengthened existing rent stabilization laws and included provisions to end high-rent vacancy deregulation, narrowed the preferential rent loophole, and put in place more protections against unnecessary major capital improvements (MCIs) and individual apartment improvements (IAI). A recent report derived from tax bills indicates that between 2007 and 2020 there was an increase of 1,975 rent stabilized units in CB2. During that same time period, 6,407 units were removed from rent stabilization yielding a net loss of 4,432 affordable units. CB2 supports anti-displacement provisions that: a) prohibit upzoning of any site that has rent-regulated or loft law units because this will create financial incentives for demolition; b) eliminate sites where additional FAR can only be used to add vertical enlargements because this will result in penthouse additions and no affordable housing; and c) include Certification of No Harassment provisions before applying for a permit for a change in use or demolition. Reliance on legal remedies that can take years to work their way through the courts to cure displacement by construction, neglect or harassment requires tenants to take often-unavailable time to find and consult with attorney and take off from work to provide testimony and attend related appointments--all while the tenants and their families experience dangerous, sometimes barely livable conditions.   Priority Action Item:  Create the Opportunity for Affordable Housing through Mayoral and Agency Support for the Transfer of Ownership to the City of the Property at 2 Howard Street.  The federal government currently owns and controls an unneeded parking garage located at 2 Howard Street.  The best and highest use of that site would be to contribute it to the on-going effort to address the housing needs of all New Yorkers by making it the location of permanently affordable housing.    The near-total absence of vacant lots in District 2, especially in the SoHo, Little Italy and Chinatown portions of the District, requires that opportunities for affordable housing be found among existing structures whose uses do not meet the most pressing needs of the Community and the City.  The federal parking garage at 2 Howard Street is just such a site.  Its 12,700 square feet could be redeveloped into affordable housing under the right circumstances.  The lynchpin to converting this site to 100% affordable housing would be the transfer of the entire site from the federal government to the City.  Only through such an effort would the Department of Housing Preservation and Development be able to ensure that all of the units built at the site would be 100% permanently affordable, instead of a fraction of that total if left to private development under the Mandatory Inclusionary Housing program or other potentially applicable programs.    CB2 renews its call for this transfer so that an appropriate site can be put to its highest and best use, and so that our Community can meet its goal of contributing to the affordable housing so desperately needed in our community and beyond.","Health care services","","#1:  Addressing serious mental health issues, especially among unhoused residents, through enhanced Intensive Mobile Treatment outreach.  Perhaps the most challenging confluence of needs in our District is found in the impact on residential, commercial, academic and tourist segments of our community from those afflicted by serious mental health needs.  Those needs are often but not exclusively manifested among the chronically unhoused and those with chemical or substance addictions.  This need could just as easily been classified under the rubrics of ""homelessness"" or ""crime and public safety,"" as the impacts transcend categories.  Frequently those with serious mental illness exhibit behavior that is dangerous to others or themselves, and which materially and negatively degrades the quality of life of virtually all other segments of the community.  The immediate collateral effect of these unmet mental health needs include the collateral impact of those who are chronically homeless, increasing both the severity of their needs and the difficulty in addressing them.    For example, the unmet needs of those with serious mental health and chemical addiction issues ineluctably lead to the presence of those who supply the illicit drugs and substances to feed these addictions.  The illegal drug trade, often brazenly in public view, nearly always includes those armed or otherwise ready to protect the sellers and suppliers from physical violence in this all-cash outdoor business.  The illegal drugs and substances to which those afflicted by serious mental health issues, and the chronically homeless who are too often swept up in the wake of the drug trade, not only make exceedingly more difficult the task of outreach aimed at offering supportive services to address these needs.  The drug use that this omnipresent illicit trade fosters often leads to aggressive behavior both in the search for funds to support the habit and in the antisocial behavior while under the influence.  Rather than focus on the endlessly revolving door of the enforcement of criminal laws, Community Board 2 prioritizes addressing one of the root causes of this cycle.    Research and experience have proved the efficacy of Intensive Mobile Treatment (""IMT"") programs as a tool in addressing serious mental health issues.  The IMT programs have demonstrated successes in removing individuals from the unhealthy environment that reinforces the cycle of addiction and deprives to which this population is prey, and creates a pathway to the services needed to address the severe mental health disorders in which they are trapped.  While no one program can cure all of the impacts of the pernicious cycle of aggressive and antisocial behavior visited on residents, businesses, students and tourists, addressing the most desperate of needs with programs proven to work is a welcome and worthy alternative to the increasingly frustrating cycle of too few resources attempting to address these problems through law enforcement and incarceration.   ","Schools","","#2: Building a New School to Address Needs for Class Size Reduction, Improved Facilities, and Educational Options.  As part of its 2012 up-zoning, New York University’s (NYU) key community benefit concession was to create the option for the City of New York to build a 100,000 sq. ft. public school on NYU-owned land located on Bleecker Street (the ""Bleecker School”).   The School Construction Authority (SCA) has until December 31, 2023 to exercise this option. Otherwise, the development rights associated with the Bleecker School will revert to NYU for university use.  Based on the average price per buildable square foot in Manhattan, the failure to exercise this option would be the loss of over $65-Million in value to NYC taxpayers and a corresponding benefit to NYU.  Since real estate values in the Greenwich Village area typically far exceed the Manhattan average, and given the dearth of open lots in our District, the failure to exercise this option likely far exceed that already significant figure.  (Please note, if the option expires, NYU would allocate no less than 25,000 square feet of above grade space for a community facility, when and if it decides to build on the site of the Bleecker School.  However, if for any one-year period NYU is unable to rent this space, 100% of the site reverts to NYU permanently.)   The Bleecker School can serve public school students from pre-kindergarten to 8th grade, i.e. PK-5, 6-8 or PK-8. A high school would require NYU consent. The Bleecker School can serve general education students, Students with Disabilities, such as students with dyslexia, or other learning disabilities and/or District 75 students.  System-wide, the lack of appropriate facilities to address these learning disabilities grows regardless of enrollment trends.  CB 2’s Position. CB 2’s March 2022 ""Resolution in Support of Ensuring the Bleecker School is Built: An Option Worth $65 Million to NYC Taxpayers"" urges the city to 1) Confirm its intention to construct a school on Bleecker Street before it loses the option and the site return entirely to NYU’s control; 2) Immediately advocate to meet the extended deadline NYU has offered, and meet with CB2 to discuss ways the our board can support the DOE’s commitment to siting the school at 130 Bleecker Street; and 3) Continue to support that when the Bleecker School is funded and built, it serves the educational needs of our community, with particular focus on the possibility of developing a school to serve students with dyslexia and other language-based learning disabilities. For updates, please visit bit.ly/Bleecker FAQ.    A false conflict has been created in the dialogue surrounding the exercise of the option and the construction of the Bleecker School.  The site offered for the Bleecker School option is currently a beloved supermarket, which serves the needs of residents including those not able to shop at higher-end markets, and which provides employment to dozens of workers from our Community and beyond.    The conflict is false because both benefits to our Community can be accommodated.  One option would b e to include a replacement supermarket at another NYU facility - such an opportunity was already proposed, but contrary to community expectations was not realized.  Other options still abound, and should be evaluated and included in an overall program to meet the total needs of the community.  Additional education needs are:  2) Building the new school at 2 Hudson Square, including the public gym space. For additional details, visit bit.ly/2HudsonSq;  3) Funding ongoing technology needs for smart boards, laptops, tablets and high speed broadband and other capital improvements to century old public school buildings, specifically:   - Broome Street Academy. Cafeteria upgrade and library, which also would be available to The Door members; - Chelsea CTE & NYC iSchool: Upgrade the gymatorium by leveling the flooring and replacing seats with bleachers; - City-As-School. Gender-neutral bathrooms and converting a janitor’s closet to another bathroom to service 500 students; - Harvest Collegiate. Access to more outdoor space; green roof for education and outdoor play; - PS 130. Upgrade windows on the building and light fixtures; and, - 75 Morton. Playground upgrade to include permanent basketball hoops.  4) Expanding programs that increase diversity and support our most vulnerable students, including: a) NYC Men Teach to recruit, train and retain talented non-traditional public school educators  to close the representation gap between our students and those that teach them, b) teacher training and reading and writing curricula in structured literacy and c) arts education to maintain most recent baseline funding.  ","","","","","Mental health and substance abuse treatment and prevention programs","","The top concern for CB2 is those who are living without shelter, who suffer severe mental illness, and/or who are addicted to drugs. A meeting CB2 organized in April with other Community Boards highlighted this critical need for services in downtown Manhattan recognizing that they may be difficult to connect to help. The Manhattan Outreach Consortium says it can take scores engagements to build trust. This problem is a humanitarian concern that also impacts on our quality of life, our economy, and public safety.   Intensive Mobile Treatment units and the Assertive Community Treatment program offer the best hope for help and should be expanded until the waiting list for access is eliminated. Staffing teams requires increasing salaries to attract and retain behavioral health professionals.   The District suffers from a paucity of homeless shelters, Safe Havens, and drop-in centers. The popularity of Paul’s Place demonstrates the success of a low-threshold model that provides rest, food and hygiene, and increased case management services. Neighborhood spillover effects of Paul’s Place are being conscientiously addressed by operator CUCS through a CAB that is responsive to residents and business owners’ concerns.   CB2 inquires if some needs of unsheltered NYers could be met with mobile units in addition to facilities such as Paul’s Place. Showers, toilet facilities, laundry and haircuts might be supplied with low-cost, innovative means.  The influx of migrant populations, whether asylum-seekers or other newly arrived immigrants, continues to stress the responsiveness of City Agencies to the breaking point.  While DHS operates the Hanbee Hotel in our District for asylum-seekers, the Citywide need and effort are daunting.  Seniors account for 16.5% of our population, a figure that is slightly higher than the city’s 14.1%. Older adults traditionally arrived in Greenwich Village long before it became an affluent neighborhood of high living and housing costs. Our primary provider of adult services is Greenwich House, which refined programming among its network of senior centers thanks to revised city contract guidelines. CB2 welcomes GH’s increased emphasis on health and wellness and supports funding a shuttle that would facilitate transportation between its centers.   The young people that are served by The Door come from all over the city. CB2 supports the expansion of its mental health facility in the face of growing need in this area.   CB2 applauds the use of the Northern Dispensary building by God’s Love We Deliverto advance its mission of home delivery of meals and fellowship.   Lenox Health Greenwich Village, the first stand-alone emergency department in Manhattan, stands where a full-service hospital served our community for 160 years. Ten years after a post-closing impact assessment, a follow-up impact study to assess the success of this model in serving the needs of our community is overdue.  ","Perhaps the most challenging confluence of needs in our District is found in the impact on residential, commercial, academic and tourist segments of our community from those afflicted by serious mental health needs.

COVID-19, while declared to be no longer an ""emergency,"" continues to have a dramatic impact on New York City and CB2 at this time, which is currently difficult to evaluate except that it is clear that the impacts have been disproportionate across communities of color and income levels.  Our community board continues to work diligently with the World Trade Center Environmental Health Center's Community Advisory Council to pass federal legislation that would provide permanent funding for this center along with the other centers dedicated to those affected by 9/11. In the interim, it is important that the City continue its funding and support of these centers.  We are very interested in ensuring that the number of new HIV infections in the City decreases and that those living with HIV and AIDS receive the services they need to remain healthy and to have stable living environments. It is essential that the City fund - and advocate forcefully with the State and Federal governments to fund - new methods to help prevent new infections, research into how to effectively reach the populations that are seeing higher infection rates, and support for the non-profit service providers who are the best responders to the epidemic and yet are losing government funding. ","Many elders in our district have decided to “age in place”, but services for our older residents have been cut drastically. The meal program at one of our centers (First Presbyterian) was eliminated a few years ago, and our other centers are overcrowded, with multiple seatings.  An important part of the meal program, social contact, seems to be ignored completely. We would like to understand the goals of the Department for the Aging because they do not seem to be in accord with our understanding of the needs.    We note that several cost-effective programs for seniors – Visiting Neighbors is the most obvious – have lost funding.  Again, we are joining our elected officials to work to solve this problem, but we need the City to support Visiting Neighbors, as well as adult day care facilities, in order to allow seniors to live independently in their own homes.        Our elderly are vulnerable to the rampant building boom in our community, when landlords seek to push seniors out. New building permits must accommodate the elderly. Many of our seniors continue to live in rent-regulated walk-up apartments. Renovation, not removal, is needed.","CB2 applauds the outreach efforts of Goddard-Riverside and the Manhattan Outreach Consortium.  It takes multiple scores of interactions with many unhoused clients to convince them to accept any form of support, including a temporary safe haven placement, shelter, or any form of physical or mental health services.    Any meaningful attempt to meet the needs of the chronically unhoused and those often found on our streets exhibiting aggressive behavior and/or chemical addiction benefits from the these services.

To exercise this option, the DOE must fund the school by December 31, 2018 and start construction by July 31, 2020. The DOE may build a school to serve students through 8th grade (not high school students.) If the DOE does not exercise this option, the buildable rights revert to NYU and NYU would allocate no less than 25,000 square feet of above grade space for a community facility. In addition, under the Restrictive Declaration, NYU has the right to build up to 70,000 square feet of below grade space. Currently, the Bleecker School is not funded in the DOE Capital Plan for 2015-2019, updated in February 2017. Need for School Seats: CB 2 recognizes the need for 600 public school seats at the Bleecker School, based on our June 2017 analysis that shows: 1. 148 to 337 seat shortfall from overcrowding at all three CB 2 elementary schools for 2015-2016, based on outdated Blue Book figures that underestimate overcrowding, at 112% at PS 3, 109% at PS 41 and 109% at PS 130 as well as 114% at PS 11, 2. 88 seat shortfall at the Duarte Square School, based on a CEQR multiplier of 0.16, 3. 169 to 225 seat shortfall resulting from the 550 Washington rezoning - approved with out any school seats - based on a CEQR multipliers of 0.12 and 0.16 respectively, 4. 100+ seats to reduce kindergarten class size to comply with Contract for Excellence class size reductions (and 650+ seats for grades K-5), 5. 69 seats to expand pre-kindergarten seats to 50% of the kindergarten cohort, 6. 131 seats to expand 3K programs to 25% of the kindergarten cohort, 7. 44 seats for District 75 students at Duarte Square, 8. 60 seats for District 75 students at Bleecker, and, 9. Additional square footage and seats to comply with physical education requirements, Next Steps: Community Board 2 is committed to ensuring that the NYC School Construction Authority exercises its option to build a school on the Bleecker Street site. To ensure that this happens, NYU needs to reinstate the School Election Notice to 2025, which was NYU's original proposal. CB 2 also urges the SCA and the DOE to take into account the demographic analysis and projections developed by CB 2 and fund the Bleecker School in the SCA's next five year Capital Plan. Existing Elementary Schools All three of our current primary schools (P.S. 3, 41, and 130) are overcrowded and in need of regular capital investment to maintain the adequacy of the physical plant. For us, excellent public schools are a priority. In FY 2017, the near term capital needs are for improved technology and new water fountains. Funding, Siting and Building New Public Schools The City Environment Quality Review (CEQR) process is flawed for analyzing how new development impacts public schools and overcrowding. Most development projects do not trigger an analysis of their impact on school seats and even when a new development triggers an Environmental Impact Analysis, the CEQR Technical Manual and EIS guidelines to do not accurately estimate the need for new public schools seats. CB 2 recommends that: 1. The Department of City Planning develop new and better formulas, based upon current demographics, that more accurately represent the percentage of families with school age children that comprise our local population, and considers the number of families who can be expected to move into new residential development; 2. The Department of City Planning to institute a policy that would require a school impact study, using local data as required under the 2014 law, on all new residential construction and conversion, regardless of size; and, 3. The City develop a mechanism that would require developers of all new residential buildings to contribute to a capital fund for public schools, and/or include new school seats within their projects. ","Positive afterschool experiences, whether academic, sports or games, are essential to keeping our youth engaged, away from troubling negative influences, and ready for school and progress.  These services are needed in CB2's District to ensure that the children of those who do not enjoy the affluence and financial benefits for which the District is known will have a level playing field with those who do. ","","","","","Public nuisance (noise, other disturbances)","","The line between public nuisance and crime grows thinner and thinner in our District.  There are zones within our District, including the northwest corner of Washington Square Park, the 6th Avenue corridor between Bleecker and West 14th Streets and along West 8th Street, Crosby Street adjacent to Houston, and others, at which both quality of life issues such as public drug use (and sales), aggressive behavior and unsanitary practices, and encampments challenge both law enforcement and providers of mental and physical health services and the efforts of the Departments of Homeless Services, Sanitation, and Health and Mental Hygiene, among others.  The brazen manner in which some of this behavior is visited on residents, businesses, students and faculty, and those visiting our District erodes the quality of life and at times presents serious threats to person and property.  Our District is proudly home to the first-ever licensed cannabis dispensaries, but for every legitimate outlet there seem to be dozens of unlicensed smoke shops (and ad hoc tables in parks) selling cannabis products whose composition and quality is completely unknown.  These illegal sources of unregulated product pose both a law enforcement risk and a blow to the quality of life to residents and legitimate businesses nearby.  In addition to this aggressive and unsavory behavior, we remain concerned about other quality of life issues throughout our District. The large number of bars, clubs, and restaurants at times compete with residences within close proximity. We receive a significant number of noise complaints from residents, often about bars or clubs that crank up the amplified sound and, at times, exacerbate the situation by leaving their doors and windows open.  Too many of these establishments respond to noise complaints and visits from the Precincts by turning down the volume only until law enforcement leaves, and then amps the noise back up as if in defiance.   Other areas of concern include the sites of Open Streets such as Petrosino Square and the northern portion of Washington Square Park where skateboarders' aggressive riding and trick-performances interfere with the use of those areas by pedestrians, cyclists and other street users.  The feeling of threat from this behavior is real, especially for those less agile or mobility-challenged, but the level of offense often does not justify aggressive enforcement action.  The proliferation of street vendors, selling merchandise and food, has become a bane to many residents and businesses, particularly on Broadway, near Astor Place, and throughout SoHo, although the efforts of the local Business Improvement Districts have improved enforcement efforts. ","No comments","No comments","","","","","Preparedness for extreme weather events (incl. coastal flooding, heat waves, cold snaps, heavy wind and rain)","","CD2 is a coastal district, with over a mile of waterfront along the Hudson River and over 10,000 residents living within the FEMA 0.2% chance floodplain. The district was impacted by Superstorm Sandy in 2012, with a portion of the district being inundated by floodwaters, causing significant property damage. As sea levels are projected to continue rising in the coming decades, storm-surge related risks are expected to increase.   Additionally, in summer and fall of 2021, as well as in several instances during the summer and fall of 2023, a series of heavy rain events resulted in significant flooding across much of the city. The effects of climate change are likely to increase the frequency of such events in the future.   The US Army Corps of Engineers (“USACE”) has recently released a study of the NY-NJ area which includes resiliency recommendations which fall within CD2. However, due to the complexity of overlapping jurisdictions within the floodplain along the Hudson, CB2 believes a more comprehensive, localized study of resiliency and flood risk along the West Side may need to be undertaken that incorporates the wide range of relevant stakeholders including the Community Boards, City agencies (DOT and DEP), State agencies (DOT and DEC), relevant utilities such as Consolidated Edison, and the Hudson River Park Trust. Additionally, with the growing combined risk of coastal and rainwater flooding, CB2 encourages the city to continue working with community stakeholders to develop an overall plan for resiliency within the district (including but not limited to coastal protection), which could include, among other things, greater investment in green infrastructure. Additionally, it is crucial that any allocation of funding for resiliency projects within CD2, as well as the specific design elements of such projects, be coordinated with significant local community review and input, from the earliest planning stages through the completion of such projects ","CD2 is a coastal district, with over a mile of waterfront along the Hudson River and over 10,000 residents living within the FEMA 0.2% chance floodplain.

","The recent changes from DSNY, including the containerization requirements for certain commercial trash collection, to be followed in short order by similar containerization rules for residential buildings and businesses other than food service, are welcome steps forward in attempting to address the overwhelming and discouraging scourge of rat infestations.  To be effective, these efforts must combine progressive policies with outreach and education to convey the common-sense need to halt the outdoor smorgasbord from which rats and vermin feed.  New residents, replacing the manufacturers who previously hired private carters, must now rely on collection by the NYC Sanitation Department. With the reopening of international travel and the end of COVID-19 restrictions, tourism is expected to return to pre-pandemic levels and further straining sanitation services. Sanitation District 2's limited staff is hard pressed to meet the community's growing needs as the area has increasingly become home to a twenty-four hour population. In particular, the agency's decision a few years ago to cut the number of supervisors in each district has made it more difficult to clean the streets as thoroughly as they had been cleaned in the past.  While the city has restored many cuts made to sanitation services during COVID-19, sanitation does not adequately service corner garbage bins that see increased usage in many areas from weekend use especially from to go food and drink containers.  The advent of roadside dining has also created impacts on local residential trash pickups and missed collections and roadside dining structures are anticipated to have significant impacts on snow removal operations throughout CB2, in particular on narrow streets and areas where there are multiple eating and drinking establishments on the same block.  We are pleased the City has dedicated significant resources and is now taking a pro-active approach in combating the rat population in our City. In particular, we applaud the Rat Indexing Initiative. We urge the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene and particularly the Parks Department to continue these aggressive efforts and to coordinate these efforts to address the recent increase in the rat population due to the growth of the Temporary Open Restaurant program. Additionally, we encourage the city to continue with the expansion of programs that have the potential to further combat the increase in rats as well as improve the overall sanitation situation in CD2, such as ""clean curbs"" style containerization programs, containerized curbside composting, and more frequent pickups of residential waste and corner bins.  Light pollution is another environmental concern which has been growing in severity over the last few years. New methods of advertising including LED lights, neon signs, bright television screens displayed in windows, vehicles serving as ""moving billboards"" with LED signs attached, and ads projected onto the sides of buildings, can all be found frequently throughout CD2. Many of these advertisements are already against DOB / DOT rules and should be subject to enforcement from these agencies. ","","","","","Affordable housing creation","","CB2 remains committed to protecting and preserving the affordable housing that we have and supporting opportunities to build affordable housing where practicable and appropriate. We urge the city to increase direct city investment in 100% affordable housing construction, adaptive reuse of existing buildings, and revise requirements that mandate far greater numbers of affordable housing units with lower median incomes and fewer loopholes than currently under the city’s Mandatory Inclusionary Housing program  Current Affordable Housing Stock in CB2. We are already home to thousands of affordable housing units of various types.  Among them are traditional rent stabilized units, Joint Live-Work Quarters for Artists (JLWQA) units in rent stabilization, Interim Multiple Dwelling (IMD) units currently under the supervision of the Loft Board, previous IMD loft units that are now rent stabilized, Mitchell Lama housing units and project-based Section-8 buildings. Rent stabilized units can be found in great numbers throughout CB2 in almost all of our neighborhoods including in Greenwich Village, the West Village, South Village, SoHo, NoHo, Little Italy, Nolita and Chinatown, and to a lesser extent in the Meatpacking District, Union Square South, and Hudson Square.    The passage of the Housing Stability and Tenant Protections Act of 2019 strengthened existing rent stabilization laws and included provisions to end high-rent vacancy deregulation, narrowed the preferential rent loophole, and put in place more protections against unnecessary major capital improvements (MCIs) and individual apartment improvements (IAI).    A recent report derived from tax bills indicates that between 2007 and 2020 there was an increase of 1,975 rent stabilized units in CB2. During that same time period, 6,407 units were removed from rent stabilization yielding a net loss of 4,432 affordable units.  CB2 supports anti-displacement provisions that: a) prohibit upzoning of any site that has rent-regulated or loft law units because this will create financial incentives for demolition; b) eliminate sites where additional FAR can only be used to add vertical enlargements because this will result in penthouse additions and no affordable housing; and c) include Certification of No Harassment provisions before applying for a permit for a change in use or demolition. Reliance on legal remedies that can take years to work their way through the courts to cure displacement by construction, neglect or harassment requires tenants to take often-unavailable time to find and consult with attorney and take off from work to provide testimony and attend related appointments--all while the tenants and their families experience dangerous, sometimes barely livable conditions.","The recent re-invigoration of the opportunity to build affordable housing on vacant, City-owned land located at 388 Hudson Street underscores the interrelation between zoning and land use regulations and practices and the achievement of virtually all other social and programmatic goals for our District.  While very much still a work in progress, using existing provisions of the Zoning Resolution, and working with partners in the various City Agencies whose jurisdiction overlap with respect to this parcel, demonstrates that Land Use decisions will carry enormous weight in determining the degree to which we will be successful in using the limited opportunities at our disposal to meet the needs of those most affected by the pernicious shortage of affordable housing. ","CB2 remains committed to protecting and preserving the affordable housing that we have and supporting opportunities to build affordable housing where practicable and appropriate. We urge the city to increase direct city investment in 100% affordable housing construction, adaptive reuse of existing buildings, and revise requirements that mandate far greater numbers of affordable housing units with lower median incomes and fewer loopholes than currently under the city's Mandatory Inclusionary Housing program Current Affordable Housing Stock in CB2. We are already home to thousands of affordable housing units of various types. Among them are traditional rent stabilized units, Joint Live-Work Quarters for Artists (JLWQA) units in rent stabilization, Interim Multiple Dwelling (IMD) units currently under the supervision of the Loft Board, previous IMD loft units that are now rent stabilized, Mitchell Lama housing units and project-based Section-8 buildings. Rent stabilized units can be found in great numbers throughout CB2 in almost all of our neighborhoods including in Greenwich Village, the West Village, South Village, SoHo, NoHo, Little Italy, Nolita and Chinatown, and to a lesser extent in the Meatpacking District, Union Square South, and Hudson Square.

Apart from the foregoing discussion of 388 Hudson Street in the section concerning Land Use, CB2 has few undeveloped sites left that are appropriate for large-scale development. Exceptions include St. John's Terminal and the Special Hudson Square District. In 2013, the City approved the Special Hudson Square District in the southwestern portion of our district. This rezoning created a mixed-use district by incentivizing residential development in combination with affordable/inclusionary housing, expanded community facility uses, ground-floor retail, and limiting as-of-right hotel development, while at the same time ensuring that commercial and manufacturing uses are retained. The proposal also included height limits and set-back regulations that will help to preserve the unique identity of the district. We are starting to see applications for conversions to residential from this neighborhood, many of which include affordable units under the auspices of the Inclusionary Housing program. Our goal is to not only encourage projects that provide affordable housing, but also encourage a sense of community and social interactions. Developer amenity packages pose a significant challenge in this regard. Another challenge is the loss of affordable units due to luxury and vacancy decontrols as well as tenant harassment, illegal landlord behavior especially with respect to construction and false DOB filings. In light of the mayor's mandate to add affordable units, the community has been encouraging consideration of a large site that provides access and repair of the underground water infrastructure at 388 Hudson Street (next to a park) as a possible and appropriate affordable housing development site. We had strongly urged the City to consider this site in lieu of the tiny site in Little Italy known as the Elizabeth Street Garden. Our preference has gone unheeded and we continue to pursue the protection of a vital and much-loved garden in a neighborhood starved for open space. ","No comments","","","","","Traffic safety and enforcement (cars, scooters, ebikes, etc.)","","The safety of all street users continues to be the most pressing Transportation concern in our District.  Our population (residents, visitors and those passing through) is endangered by the growing threat of vehicular conflicts to our safety and of vehicular emissions to our health.  One of CB2’s major traffic problems continues to be with vehicular congestion around the entrance and exit to the Holland Tunnel. The tunnel brings in great volumes of private vehicles visiting the city from out of state, but there also is increasing automotive traffic from all entryways as more and more people choose to drive rather than use mass transit even after the surge in private vehicle use during Covid.    We are looking forward to congestion pricing helping to turn this tide, not only by making our streets safer and quieter with cleaner air while helping to provide necessary support for transit, but also in creating more livable space in our community. We are hopeful that differences concerning congestion pricing can be quickly balanced and implementation be speedily accomplished.    Trucks are a major concern, making many local commercial deliveries, and using our narrow streets to travel from the Hudson River to the F.D.R. Drive, south to the Financial District and to the outer boroughs. Our fragile network of narrow streets is vulnerable to these trucks' heavy impact on our infrastructure, while those who walk our streets are at risk of colliding with them, which already has resulted in serious injuries and fatalities.  This is compounded by more on-line shopping than ever before, leading to more deliveries and an upsurge of delivery trucks cramming our streets.  We've been asking for the use of cargo bike/delivery cart bicycle vehicles and, if trucks must be used, to employ smaller, electrically powered ones with ""Direct Vision"" cabs that give total visibility to activities outside the trucks.  We also support off-hours deliveries, at night if feasible, and Neighborhood Loading Zones.  Our District is also swept up in the on-going debate concerning a host of delivery and other electric-powered and gas-powered vehicles, too many of whom do not cede sidewalks to pedestrians, and who ride in ways that create a feeling of great danger in pedestrians even where the actual risk is materially different than the perceived risk.  The proliferation of tour buses on our small, historic streets has produced a host of negative impacts, including pedestrian endangerment, air and noise pollution, traffic congestion, and broken street beds. CB2 calls for increased regulation, enforcement, and relocation of tour bus routes to larger, more accommodating thoroughfares. A tour bus route-plan is long overdue, as is legislation putting it into action.","Disabled access in our subway stations is greatly lacking, with not even a handful of stations in the CB2 District providing either elevators and/or escalators to enable the many physically challenged in our area to use the subways. Although the Capital Plan is providing for installation of more elevators and escalators throughout the city, many, many stations where such ADA accessibility is needed will still go without, including most of those in CB2.  Our goal is to have every one of the subway stations in CB2 be furnished with the elevators and escalators that will give all of our citizens the rightful access they need to get around.  In addition, every effort needs to be made to repair and rehabilitate our deteriorating subway stations for users' comfort and safety. In particular, the West 4th Street station has been severely deteriorating over many years of neglect to the point that current conditions are not only off-putting, but also a threat to people's health and safety.  All of the platforms and surrounding areas are plagued with moldy, leaky and peeling walls and ceilings, and a full rehabilitation is long overdue. ","Community District 2 has several internationally known tourist destinations that encourage heavy nighttime and weekend usage of the district’s streets, by both cars and pedestrians. New York City Transit should be initiating a major effort to increase the use of public transportation in this context as well as in general by making it more comfortable, convenient, accessible and frequent, and making transit access points more user friendly for both visitors and residents. The removal of many of our subway station agents compromises our safety and takes away our source for vital information and orientation. We vehemently oppose these cuts that are completely counter to the sustainability goals of PlaNYC and Vision Zero. Public transportation makes more efficient use of space and energy, significantly reduces air and noise pollution, and minimizes pedestrian/vehicular conflicts. Therefore, instead of imposing these destructive cuts on a population that already depends so strongly on transit and its benefits, opportunities must be explored and followed through in providing new transit access and routes in areas of need, and sources of funding for our suffering transit system must be pinpointed and secured.  CB2 has passed at different times at least three resolutions in support of congestion pricing, both to raise funds for transit improvements and to curtail the ever-growing congestion that disrupts our streets.      One major transit deprivation impact has resulted from the removal of the M6 bus route and the diversion of the M1, M3, and M5 buses from the routes they followed for many years in District 2. The new route locations are difficult, if not impossible, to reach for CB2’s sizable and growing senior and disabled populations who have depended on convenient bus service to access important destinations, such as medical facilities and food shopping. They have resulted in distances, timing, stop locations, and reduced frequencies that severely penalize the entire District’s residents, workers, parents and children because of the long waits, crowded buses, far apart stops and lack of needed accessibility. These routes need to be restored to their former locations that provide the service the community needs although with every passing year, the likelihood of this happening becomes more doubtful, but we're hopeful that the remaining existing routes can be modified for the comfort and convenience of our seniors and all our citizens who depend on these buses for transportation.     In addition, every effort needs to be made to repair and rehabilitate our deteriorating subway stations for users’ comfort and safety. In particular, the West 4th Street station has been severely deteriorating over many years of neglect to the point that current conditions are not only off-putting, but also a threat to people’s health and safety. All of the platforms and surrounding areas are plagued with moldy, leaky and peeling walls and ceilings, and a full rehabilitation is long overdue. L-train stations along 14th Street are also in need of upgrades, and their 15-month closing during the Canarsie Tunnel Project presents a perfect opportunity for carrying out needed improvements, including ADA accessibility, at all three CB2 L-train stations. At this point, agreement has been reached for renovations to be done that make our 6th Avenue 14th Street station ADA accessible.  We are hoping that not only CB2's other two stations on 14th Street along the L line can be made accessible in the very near future, but that all the subway stations in our district can be converted into ADA-accessible ones very quickly, something that is very needed and long overdue.","","","","","Insufficient park or open space","","Preserve Elizabeth Street Garden and Build More Affordable Senior Housing at Alternative Site.   Since 2013, CB2 has held seven public hearings and passed five resolutions in support of the permanent preservation of Elizabeth Street Garden in its entirety as public open, green space and urges the City to transfer jurisdiction over this lot to the Parks Department. CB2 also supports the development of affordable housing at an alternative city-owned site at Hudson and Clarkson Streets where up to five times as much senior housing can be built, but only if Elizabeth Street Garden is preserved in its entirety.  Neighborhood Underserved by Open Space. The neighborhood around Elizabeth Street Garden lacks open space. Little Italy and SoHo account for 23% of CB2's population but have only 3% of its open space, virtually 100% paved, for an open space ratio of only 0.07 acres per 1,000 residents, as compared with the City Planning goal of 2.5 acres per 1,000 residents. Furthermore, the majority of CB2's open space is in Washington Square and Hudson River Parks, nearly a mile and 1.2 miles from the Garden, respectively. Residents in Little Italy and SoHo are less likely to use these spaces with frequency. Furthermore, Elizabeth Street Garden is located in the only downtown Manhattan neighborhood that the NYC Parks Department defines as “underserved” by open space.  About the Garden. Elizabeth Street Garden is a unique community park and green space with open lawn, majestic trees, flowering garden beds, and sculptural artworks located in the Little Italy neighborhood of Manhattan, between Prince and Spring Streets. City-owned and privately leased, the Garden attracts more than 100,000 visitors each year, including local elementary students, families and seniors, as well as residents from around the city and tourists from around the world, who learn about the Garden from several travel websites and guidebooks.   The Garden is open to the public, weather permitting and volunteers provide free public and educational programming. The Garden's design, size and configuration make it ideally suited for movies, music, yoga, community festivals, arts performances, educational programs, gardening and quiet meditation that are not offered in any other nearby public community space.","With only about .58 acres of parkland per 1000 residents, our District has one of the lowest ratios of public open space in the City, and with next-to-no unbuilt lots and the property values for our fully built up land being in the stratosphere, the City standard of 2.5 acres is an unobtainable goal.  Meeting the needs of our community for both passive and active recreation space is thus a priority and a challenge.   One means to address these needs is to provide a fully functional Recreation Center in the West Village.  Our community requires and deserves a Recreation Center and an outdoor pool. The Tony Dapolito Recreation Center has been closed for years and is expected to remain in this state for at least a couple more years. We are no longer confident that the building will be able to be repaired or that doing so is worth doing for the cost that will be required. The pool that sits next to it has had to be closed for two summers and will remain closed for at least two more because the wall of the rec center building is potentially unstable and collapse of it could injure pool users.  In part to provide a viable alternative solution, CB2 in July2023 called for the new proposed affordable housing building at 388 Hudson Street to ""include a NYC Parks recreation center of at least three floors at the base of the building footprint.""  Despite these challenges, important progress has been made in recent years. There has been a steady and ongoing stream of improvements to the quality and condition of our parks with recently completed renovations at Passanante Playground and DeSalvio Playground (thanks to support from our elected officials and an active and energetic group of parents) as well as the opening of new improvements at Pier 40 and the Hudson River.  The community looks forward to the realization of usable open space at Duarte Square, for which funding is in place, as well as passive open space at a portion of the 388 Hudson Street site. Funding and design work has progressed for upgrades at Father Fagan Park and Jackson Square. These initiatives will make our parks more attractive and safer, thereby providing more people a better park experience.  These additions and improvements are critical, but they have not been sufficient because the population of families with young children continues to rise in our district, increasing the overcrowding of our active play spaces. In addition, several large-scale development projects and major rezoning proposals recently have been approved which will add to the pressure on our parks and the need for more open space, particularly those in which active recreation will be possible. We now see a need to strive to take advantage of every opportunity to create new open space.  We thank our elected officials and City agencies for their support and we urge them to continue to help us protect, preserve and improve the public open space while we ask that they work with us to pursue every opportunity for creating new open space in our district. In addition, while the replacement of lost steet trees remains a priority for the overall quality of life especially in areas distant from true open space, a 5-Borough President initiative provides much-needed support for that effort. ","Community Board 2 is delighted by the arts and culture that the Whitney Museum of American Art in the Gansevoort Market district has infused into our district since opening its doors in May 2015, and also appreciates the institution's regular communications with and support of our board. This important institution, which was originally founded in our district, is a great asset to the Far West Village and has begun to help re-focus the neighborhood as an art and design district. The Museum is an exciting center of art, with exterior exhibition spaces as well the traditional interior spaces. Integrated with the High Line Park that runs along the eastern face of the building, the museum offers restaurants, gathering places, and other public areas as part of its overall design. In addition, our district has several other fine museums, including the NYC Fire Museum, the Children's Museum of the Arts, the Museum of Chinese in America, the Leslie Lohman Museum of Gay and Lesbian Art, the Merchant's House Museum, and The Drawing Center, among others. CB2 is also excited about the Jackie Robinson Museum, which is scheduled to open in our district within the next couple of years. Community District 2 is also home to a unique array of performance spaces, Off-Broadway and independent theaters, film centers, and dance organizations. We take tremendous pride in the vibrant cultural scene that these organizations provide our community. These cultural organizations include: HB Playwrights; Cherry Lane Theatre; HERE; Rattlestick Playwrights Theater; Greenwich House & Greenwich House Pottery; The Gym at Judson; IRT Theater; IFC Center; Film Forum; Angelika; Cinema Village; Quad Theater; Actors Playhouse ; 13th Street Rep; Minetta Lane Theater; Westbeth Center; New Ohio; The Public Theater; Joe's Pub; Ars Nova; Axis Theater; The Duplex; Cornelia Street Café; Peridance; Martha Graham Dance Studio; Soho Playhouse; The Greene Space (WNYC Radio); Tenri Cultural Institute; New York Studio School of Drawing, Painting and Sculpture; Lucille Lortel Theater; Village Vanguard; Institutional theaters of NYU and The New School, among others. While we have a vibrant arts and culture scene in our area, we continue to be concerned about the impact on the downtown arts scene due to the closure of so many of the district's Off-Broadway and small theaters and other cultural spaces. The main causes are the exponential increase in rents and ongoing funding challenges faced by non-profits. Some years ago, we supported a proposal to use tax incentives that would encourage landlords to retain live performance space. In addition, CB2 strongly supports funding for the arts both in our area and citywide, and increased arts education in public schools, as a growing body of studies presents compelling evidence connecting student learning in the arts to a wide array of academic and social benefits. Namely, these various studies continue to indicate that the arts help to improve visual analysis skills and critical judgments, inspire creativity and improve motivation, collaboration, attitudes and attendance. B. Arts Advocacy Advocating for arts organizations and artists located within CB2 and for those that produce, program or present arts and culture within CB2 has been, and remains, a top priority for our board. For one, our committee has a history of writing resolutions and letters of support for non-profit arts organizations located within our district that are seeking funding or restoration of funding from grant organizations and city agencies. We were also the first community board City-wide to write a letter of support for New York City's first comprehensive cultural plan. In addition, we speak out against entities and agencies that seek to utilize our local parks and public spaces for arts-related projects that do not have wide community support, while strongly supporting public arts projects that are in alignment with the spirit of our community and neighborhoods. We also strive to foster connections amongst arts organizations located within our district to forge stronger cultural alliances. Finally, as is widely known, CB2 has historically been the home of a wide array of talented artists and, as such, our committee remains dedicated to advocating that the work of these local artists is a part of planned arts programming within our district whenever possible. ","We are happy that long-awaited renovations and upgrades to the Jefferson Market Library are under way. On that note, we also think it is time for a master plan to renovate the Hudson Park branch to make its amenities more available. It is an amazing, albeit, somewhat inaccessible facility that has great potential if it was more readily used by the community-at-large. Finally, we are continue to be concerned that budget cuts have resulted in a reduction in staff and in the hours of operation at the libraries in our district. These reductions impact young children and the elderly most of all. We continue to request that additional funds be allocated to keep the libraries and their community rooms open for as many hours as possible. We also ask that the New York Public Library provide a dedicated staff to create special youth programming. ","Community Board budgets have not received an increase to their baseline funding in years, and yet Community Boards are required to do more with less every year.  Community Boards adapted to virtual meetings during the pandemic.  The end of the Covid-era emergency declarations required CBs to return to in-person meetings, but the public now expects fully interactive hybrid meetings.  Yet CBs are given neither the expense nor the capital funding needed to address these heightened needs.

It is bounded by 14th Street to the north, the East River to the east, the Brooklyn Bridge to the south, and Fourth Avenue and the Bowery to the west, extending to Baxter and Pearl Streets south of Canal Street. This community is filled with a diversity of cultures, religions, incomes, and languages. Its character comes from its heritage as a historic and present-day first stop for many immigrants. CD 3 is one of the most densely populated Community Districts in New York City, with approximately 141,066 residents.[1] Our community is diverse: we identify as 28% Asian, 11% Black, 25% Hispanic, and 33% White.[2] With this diversity comes different language needs. Twenty-seven percent of the district speaks English less than ""very well,"" which highlights the need for translation and interpretation services. Within CD 3 the percentage break down of languages is 16% speak Spanish, 25.6% speak Asian and Pacific Island languages, and only 53% speak only English.[3] Our residents are very proud of their historic and diverse neighborhood, however, the very characteristics that make this district unique also make it a challenging place to plan and ensure services for all residents and businesses.  Growing Inequality and the Impact of COVID-19  Many people within our community live on the edge of homelessness and economic survival. Inequality and housing precarity are tied to rising housing costs and stagnating incomes within the Community District. In the 2nd quarter of 2022, there was a 43% increase in median asking rents in CD 3 compared to the same time period in 2021. The median asking rent of CD 3 in Q2 2023 is $4,295 a month. This would require a renter household to have an income of $163,000 to not be considered rent burdened,[4] while the median household income for CD 3 is $52,720 and 84.3% of district residents are renters.[5] The gap between the lowest and highest earners in CD 3 continues to widen.[6] In 2021, 24 percent of renter households in CD 3 were severely rent burdened (spent more than 50 percent of household income on rent.)[7] Before COVID-19, an estimated 24 percent of residents in CD 3 were living below poverty level, with approximately 36 percent of children under the age of 18 and 31 percent of adults 65 and over living below the poverty level.[8] COVID-19 increased hardships for low-income residents and residents of color (68 percent of the CD 3 population), creating even more destitution and need for resources.[9]  The onset of COVID-19 in early 2020 significantly impacted the residents and business owners in CD 3 and emphasized the inequalities and income disparities that previously existed among our different communities. The COVID-19 case rate in CD 3 between February 2020 and April 2021 was 87.2 (per 1,000 residents) and the death rate between March 2020 and April 2021 was 2.7 (per 1,000 residents).[10] We now know that New York City residents from low-income communities like CD 3 have tested positive for COVID-19 antibodies at a higher- than-average rate, underscoring the disproportionate impact of the disease on people of color.[11] The district now has one of the highest diversity (income diversity gap) in household incomes out of all 59 districts in New York City and it continues to grow.[12]  The pandemic has also exacerbated New York City's housing crisis, a major issue in CD 3 prior to COVID-19, and this impact has hit particularly hard for Black and Hispanic New Yorkers who have lost work. It has heightened existing inequities in our District and is highlighting the need for more resources to support our community.  Community-based organizations that provide essential services for residents in CD 3 continue to struggle to provide more services and fund themselves with fewer resources, particularly in the fiscal environment that COVID-19 has created. Community healthcare and social service providers face similar challenges and residents are left to grapple with service reductions while they are experiencing extreme economic and health vulnerability.  CD 3 is also a coastal community that was severely impacted by Superstorm Sandy in 2012, and the area is increasingly vulnerable to future climate change impacts and extreme weather scenarios that affect the waterfront. Several coastal resiliency projects have been planned for the district and are in various phases of approval, funding, or construction. This issue of coastal vulnerability is further compounded by the city's identification of a majority of CD 3 being an environmental justice area.  According to local law, an environmental justice area is a low-income community or a minority community, based on US Census data.[13] These areas are more vulnerable to potential environmental injustice because of the history of racism and inequitable resource distribution.

Additionally, CD 3 is experiencing a crisis of street homelessness. While new affordable housing is needed, it must be targeted at affordability levels appropriate for current neighborhood incomes. Under the City’s Housing New York Plan, there were 859 new affordable housing unit starts in CD 3 between 2014 and 2020, with 25 percent targeted at households earning more than $82,000 per year. However, the median household income in the district is just $43,400.   ","Homelessness","","Street homelessness increased in areas in CD 3 before the pandemic The recent history of street homelessness as measured by the Hope Count for Manhattan showed a 40% increase in 2016 followed by decreases of two and ﬁve percent, and then an increase of 55 percent in the January 2020 report. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated street homelessness. We expect New York City to continue to be in a homelessness crisis in FY24 as there appears to be no plan to address the many issues associated with homelessness which were evident before COVID-19. COVID-19 has highlighted social, economic, and racial inequities, and people of color and people living with disabilities are disproportionately represented in the homeless population in New York City. There is a recognized need for mental health services and a variety of programs for those experiencing homelessness, however there are no benchmarks or tracking systems to show effectiveness of programs. The need for effective mental health outreach and treatment was evident before the COVID-19 pandemic, but the shutdown of services, isolation, and other consequences of the pandemic means that enhanced outreach and targeted services will be needed in the current and coming year. One of the lessons learned from COVID-19 may be that congregate shelters are not as safe as smaller units for both health and personal safety. The City should also investigate creating smaller modular units within shelters for both safety and privacy. CB 3 has long advocated for more Safe Havens and supportive housing as well as more affordable housing as part of the solution to end homelessness. Two of our parks, Tompkins Square Park and Sara Delano Roosevelt (SDR) Park, have for the last several years become the only open space for some shelter residents as well as magnets for drug dealers, users, and other crime. A harm reduction approach is needed for individuals experiencing homelessness who also actively use substances. ","Senior services","","CD 3 needs critically important investments to help older residents live healthier and more fulﬁlling lives as they age in place. In CD 3: • There are 31, 259 residents over the age of 65; • Approximately 33% of all seniors in the district live below the poverty line; • 43% of seniors are living with a disability; • 33% of seniors experience ambulatory difﬁculties; and • 50% of seniors live alone.  Fifty-nine percent of CD 3 seniors are foreign born, with 24% speaking Spanish at home and 45% speaking Asian and Paciﬁc Island languages at home. Therefore, CD 3 requires culturally and linguistically appropriate health and social services for its large senior population. In practice, seniors require care on a continuum that covers their diverse cultural, health and wellness needs. Priority concerns of seniors that have been identiﬁed are: • Concerns about isolation • Food access • Wellness concerns such as needs for physical activity, mental stimulation, coping with depression, low self-esteem & self-worth issues (especially amongst the oldest) • Staying informed with accurate information about health and other issues. Programs at senior centers and Naturally Occurring Retirement Communities (NORCs) provide programs to address these concerns. ","","","","","Mental health and substance abuse treatment and prevention programs","","During 2021, the aftereffects of the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the need for heightened mental health services, both general and targeted. Models of care that eliminate or decrease barriers to access, including the CONNECT model and improved telehealth services, should be expanded, scaled, and made sustainable. Mental health support services should also be expanded, including programs that focus on mindfulness and well-being, in addition to programs for those with diagnosed mental illnesses. The demand for mental health services among the Asian-American community has grown partly due to anti-Asian hate crimes and isolation associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Targeted mental health services, including services for migrant families, individuals and families experiencing homelessness, young people, older adults, and other priority populations in CB3, should also be strengthened (Burrowes, Hyacinth. (2023). Manhattan Community Board 3 Mental Health Resources Survey. https://www.nyc.gov/assets/manhattancb3/downloads/resources/CB3-mental-health-survey-directory-2023.pdf).  In addition, behavioral health services are a priority for people with underlying conditions: seniors, first responders, and those with substance abuse disorders and pre-existing health conditions, people with disabilities, and those who have experienced traumatic changes in their employment. An overall plan to address the continuing increase in substance abuse and an increase in outreach/harm reduction services is needed. ","COVID-19 has highlighted health justice inequities that are particularly notable in CD 3 because of the large gap between the lowest and highest income populations and concentration of lower income communities of color who are at two to three times higher risk of contracting COVID-19 than wealthier, white residents.[1] Underlying health conditions and low-paying essential jobs are two of the most visible conditions causing this disparity. There are seven federally qualified health care centers in CD 3 according to the Health Resources and Services Administration locator tool.  The changes in responding to health care needs due to COVID-19 have highlighted areas of unmet needs as well as new trends in the provision of health care. In 2021, approximately 5 percent of CD 3 residents were uninsured.[2] The trends and priorities below were reported to the CB 3 Health and Human Services Committee by the following community health care facilities: Charles B. Wang Community Health Center, the Betances Health Center, and the Gouverneur Health Facility.      [1] Serkez, Y. (June 4, 2020).

","CD 3 needs critically important investments to help older residents live healthier and more fulfilling lives as they age in place, specifically, case management, healthcare assistance, and activities that support aging-in-place in CD 3[1]:   	There are 38,867 residents (24.5 percent of total CD 3 population) over the age of 60;    	Approximately 33 percent of all seniors in the district-live below the poverty line; 	32 percent of seniors are living with a disability; 	29 percent of seniors experience ambulatory difficulties; and 	53 percent of seniors live alone[2]      In practice, seniors require care on a continuum that covers their diverse cultural, health and wellness needs. Priority concerns of seniors that have been identified are:   	Concerns about isolation 	Food access 	Wellness concerns such as needs for physical activity, mental stimulation, coping with depression, low self-esteem & self-worth issues (especially amongst the oldest) 	Staying informed with accurate information about health and other issues      Programs at Older Adult Centers and Naturally Occurring Retirement Communities (NORCs) provide programs to address these concerns:   	Older Adult Centers   According to the Department for the Aging (DFTA), in CD 3 there are 13 DFTA-funded Older Adult Centers (formerly known as senior centers).[3] Each center is particularly important as they are culturally sensitive to the needs of our diverse communities. Given the growing senior population, there is a need to maintain and expand the existing facilities and to address significant capital maintenance needs.      	Naturally Occurring Retirement Communities   In addition to senior centers, NORCs are also vital in CD 3. A NORC is a multi-age housing development or neighborhood that was not originally designed for seniors, but now is home to a significant number of older persons. There are eight NORCs in CD 3 that provide Supportive Services Programs to maximize and support the successful aging in place of older residents (See appendix for list of NORCs in CD 3).     Often, NORC residents can access health and social services in their own buildings, building complexes or locally within their neighborhoods. Both the City Council and DFTA recognize the need for NORCs in the community and are working to budget more NORC programs. NORC programs are a model for bringing necessary care and support to seniors living in age-integrated buildings and neighborhoods. Nurses and social workers are necessary to provide supportive services.      [1] Burrowes, Hyacinth. (2023).

Aging Connect. https://www1.nyc.gov/site/dfta/about/contact-aging-connect.page ","In January 2023, more than 72,000 people each night slept in New York City's main shelter system, the highest number since the city started keeping count forty years ago.[1] While this number includes the migrants, the crisis of unsheltered New Yorkers existed before the migrant crisis as evidenced by the increase in the number of New Yorkers currently living on the streets and subways [as shown by the 2022 Homeless Outreach Population Estimate (HOPE) Count].[2]  The annual HOPE count survey conducted by New York City counted 4,042 people sleeping on the streets or in the subways on January 24, 2023-up from 3,439 in 2022. The previous year, the same report also showed an increase of about 1,000 people from the preceding year. Department of Social Services, attributed the rise partially to end of COVID-related interventions, such as the use of federally funded private rooms in commercial hotels, which led to a far lower count earlier in the pandemic.[3]  Street Homeless Outreach   Manhattan Outreach Consortium (MOC) workers are the primary contacts for case management and outreach to those unhoused on the street in the effort to have them accept placements and services. Providing necessary tools for these workers are of primary importance:   	More outreach staff are needed-both to fill vacancies and handle the increase in clients and higher salaries to retain staff. Current caseload sizes are 30-40 clients while the ideal caseload would be 25 clients per worker.[4] 	Translation resources are needed. Currently there are a few Spanish speaking staff and no Chinese speaking staff. Outreach to the homeless requires building trust and culturally sensitive communication. Phone translation does not provide this and often translators are not familiar with terms used. 	Outreach workers report an increase in fentanyl overdoses. Goddard staff has created a partnership with local harm reduction providers to include harm reduction outreach. A formalized, funded program is needed to have this coordinated outreach more frequently and throughout the District. 	Mental Health resources are lacking. There is anecdotally an increase in homeless people needing mental health services. Services must be provided with consistent follow up where the people are living-on the street. There are currently not enough outreach psychiatric health care services.[5]      Shelters  CD 3 is home to 13 permanent shelters, among the highest in the city.55 The perception of many people experiencing homelessness that the shelters are unsafe appears to contribute to the many homeless people refusing services unless there is a Safe Haven bed available in a community they are connected to.  In 2017-2018, the Coalition for the Homeless conducted a survey of individuals sleeping on the streets and subways. The majority of those interviewed on the streets had stayed in the DHS shelter system at some point and were unwilling to return to the shelter system because they feared for their safety and/or experienced difficulty following the rules and procedures. Additionally, two-thirds of those interviewed had mental health needs.[6]  Coalition for the Homeless' State of The Homeless 2023 report cites the following factors that contribute to an increase in shelter population[7]:   	Average length of time that families and single adults must spend in shelters is now longer than it has ever been; 	The number of homeless households provided with City rent vouchers to help them move from shelters into permanent housing reached its lowest level in five years; 	The number of homeless single adults placed into supportive housing was at the second-lowest level since 2004 (with only the previous year being marginally lower).      CB 3 has long advocated for more Safe Havens and supportive housing as well as more affordable housing as part of the solution to end homelessness. As noted in the 2022 State of the Homeless report, while the long-term retention rate for individuals referred to congregate shelters was only about 24 percent in the 19 months leading up to December 2021. The rate for those referred to Safe Havens was far higher, at roughly 63 percent. (Community issues sometimes arise around adult shelters.) Outdoor space and programming that engages the residents is necessary. Better security is also necessary for both the neighboring community members and the shelter residents.

","","","","","","Other - Write In (Required)","","Social workers and counselors All schools have social workers but for the majority of schools, this is a part time position focused on managing mandated services. Eleven out of 19 schools in School District 1 report a need for a full-time social worker who can support the mandated services, support students and families' additional needs and work proactively to support future needs before they arise.  In school year 2022-23, School District 1 was able to partner with Families Thriving and NYU SW intern program and it positively impacted services to students and families.  However, schools need full time support staff as opposed to itinerant staff because it better supports relationship building.   Community Board 3 has overlapping unmet needs that restrict the ability for our social service organizations to serve our most underserved residents, particularly children and seniors.  •Families no longer qualified for programs due to outdated income requirements Many families now surpass the federal maximum income requirement for programs serving low-income families (such as Head Start). This is often the result of wage increases from minimum wage to living wage without corresponding increases in maximum income requirements. Families earning a living wage are still in need of these programs.  •Pay disparity and competitive compensation There is a lack of pay parity between staff of DYCD funded programs and staff of DOE funded programs. Staff of DOE programs receive COLA, while staff of DYCD programs do not, the result is that pay parity is not sustained. Service providers saw an exodus of staff from DYCD funded programs as a result.  In 2021, City Council legislation required pay parity for educators in early childhood programs, whether funded by DOE or DYCD (CBO based). However, the pay parity is not sustained. While first year CBO-based teachers receive a salary that is comparable to that of DOE teachers, DOE teachers also receive salary increases over time whereas CBO teachers do not (Education Alliance (n.d.) https://edalliance.org/).  Service providers saw an exodus of staff from DYCD funded programs as a result. In order to operate sustainable programs, pay parity is needed regardless of funding agencies (Cheng, M., Director Child Development Services, Ho, W., President). The lack of competitive compensation for staff impacts mental health programs and youth serving programs as well.  Local providers report recruitment and retention of highly qualified staff is hindered by the inability to offer competitive compensation.  This compensation would not only enable them to serve more people, but also promote recruitment and retention of a diverse, culturally sensitive, linguistically competent staff(https://www.nyc.gov/assets/man.)Youth service providers report that they are unable to recruit and retain more direct service staff such as program group leaders because they are competing with other industries such as the retail industry when hiring.  ","Community School District 1 (CSD1) schools are outdated and under-resourced. From 2012-2022, CSD1 lost 3,643 students.[1] CD 3 is in need of a new public-school facility for the following reasons:   	Eighty-five percent of CSD1 schools share a building with one or more schools resulting in inadequate access to gym, arts and enrichment, science labs, and acceptable hours for school lunch. Sixteen percent of schools share a gym and/or yard space with three or more schools and almost 1/4 of these schools share gym facilities between two schools. This lack of access is further exacerbated by the fact that 35 percent of gym facilities are used for multiple purposes, creating ""cafegymalabatoriums.""[2] 	The NYC Department of Education (DOE) mandates 120 minutes of physical education per week. Students in CD 3 do not have equal access to physical education and activity due to inadequate space. 	Inadequate, aging buildings were not designed for today's students. Middle and high school students often learn in classrooms designed for elementary school students. CD 3 has schools built from 1900 on-the average age of CD 3 schools is 80 years old. (See school age chart in appendix.) 	The lack of technology infrastructure in all these aging buildings prevents CD 3 children from access to 21st Century College and Career Ready skills. With the advent of updated state testing moving to an online format, these aging buildings will limit students' ability to compete in this new online testing format. There is a dearth of K-8 schools in the western side of School District 1 where the proposed site is located.       [1] New York City Department of Education. (2021).

Gym Survey. https://cec1nyc.org/gym-survey/. ","Families in CD 3 rely heavily on community-based programs during after-school hours, weekends, and holidays because 32 percent of our children under 18 years of age live below poverty level.[1] The biggest need is for after-school options for 3K and PK. Restrictions for CBOs who run these programs lead to lack of free affordable options for the youngest learners. It also means families are not entering our schools in 3K and PK but instead opting for full day programs so they can work. There is a need to provide support to families to access public education in 3K because this would provide the most benefit to early childhood literacy development.[2]      [1] NYU Furman Center.

Lower East Side/Chinatown MN03. https://furmancenter.org/neighborhoods/view/lower-east-side-chinatown).  Major felonies include murder, robbery, felony assault, burglary, grand larceny along with drug dealing. Crime between January and July across precincts 5, 7, and 9 increased 45.8% from 2021 to 2022. In January through July 2022, Precinct 5 experienced a total of 635 crimes committed (410 in 2021), Precinct 7 a total of 816 crimes committed (569 in 2021), and Precinct 9 experienced a total of 1,116 crimes committed (803 in 2021). There was an increase of burglary, assault and grand larceny, across all three precincts. However, between June 2022 and June 2023, crime across Precincts 5, 7, and 9 fell 4.01%, from 2,167 to 2080 (City of New York Police Department. 2023. NYPD CompStat2.0. https://compstat.nypdonline.org/2e5c3f4b-85c1-4635-83c6- 22b27fe7c75c/view/89).  There has been a significant increase in the number of complaints to the Community Board regarding open drug use and crime. One of our parks, SDR, is known as the destination location in NYC to buy K2 (https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/15/nyregion/sara-roosevelt-park-nyc.html). There are complaints from residents for some blocks and developments that are home to drug dealers as well residents seeking safe homes. We have seen gang violence result in murder and drug dealers murdered over land jurisdiction (https://evgrieve.com/2022/05/after-deadly-shooting-fearful-residents.html). Police have been contacted and have some short-term successes, but there does not appear to strategies and plans to bring safety in all areas of CD 3. This displays a need for more harm reduction resources in addition to resources with a proactive focus on the root causes of these issues.  Hate Crimes in CB 3 are primarily Anti-Asian, Anti-Jewish, and Anti-Gay. During the COVID pandemic in CB 3, Anti-Asian crimes rose to 25 reported to NYPD from March 2021 to March 2022, then lowered to 3 the following year. Anti-Jewish reported crimes rose from 9 to 10 in the same years. A report by the Asian American Bar Association of NY notes that hate crimes and incidents often go unreported because, for many victims, filing an official report can be time consuming, too personal, and burdensome. There may be language barriers, as well as fear of backlash from the community or retaliation from the perpetrator (Asian American Bar Association of New York. 2021. A Rising Tide of Hate and Violence against Asian Americans in New York During COVID-19: Impact, Causes, Solutions. https://cdn.ymaws.com/www.aabany.org/resource/resmgr/press_releases/2021/a_rising_tide_of_hate_and_vi.pdf).

Manhattan CD 3 Community Profile. https://communityprofiles.planning.nyc.gov/manhattan/3). Current programs that finance residential resiliency upgrades are not being widely used in CD 3, and there is a need for the City to tailor programs to the specific financial needs of low- and moderate-income housing providers, including HDFC co-op boards, so that they can complete critical building infrastructure upgrades and take proactive steps to become environmentally resilient. Waterfront Pier 42 has been partially funded, but the delayed project leaves the unfulfilled need to complete the critical missing link of public access along Lower Manhattan’s East River shoreline. Although additional funding from the city has been provided as part of the East Side Coastal Resiliency mitigations, this is only for the construction of temporary fields and amenities. The full masterplan approved by CB 3 in 2013 would provide needed access to the waterfront at Pier 42 with passive recreation space, barriers to storm surges, marine habitat, and ecological education opportunities.  ","","CD 3 was one of three core rat reduction neighborhoods in the City due to the immense number of rats. in Manhattan. The program was paused during the shutdown and has now been reactivated. Gains due to rat reduction have been lost. 311 rat complaints have increased. From January to June 2019 there were 340 complaints. In the same time period in 2022, there were 401 complaints. Compared to 2019, overall burrow counts at NYCHA are higher in 2022. However, burrow counts peaked in April 2022, and then steadily declined through June 2022. Inspections restarted in March and Active Rat Sign (ARS) failure rate has ranged from 17 percent to 12 percent but is now trending toward 20 percent. Compliance inspections of properties in 2021 has the extraordinarily high rate of 51 percent ARS failure rate. (Dept of Health and Mental Hygiene, Director of Neighborhood Intervention Pest Control Services) The year lost to the program during the shutdown will be added back to the program. The Open Streets/ Restaurants with roadside and sidewalk dining has created additional need for sanitation inspection and enforcement.

","","","","","Affordable housing creation","","Build and Preserve Affordable Housing  Since 2010, city-wide housing development of new units has lagged far behind population growth, largely due to restrictive regulations and high construction costs. At the same, time the share of rent-burdened households paying more than 30 percent of their income for housing has steadily increased, while the number of apartments available at low rents has shrunk, leaving the lowest-income households with few options.  There is a need for more deeply affordable housing in CD 3 to address the crises of inadequate housing supply, affordability, inequality, and homelessness in the district. New opportunities for affordable housing must be found, including senior housing, supportive housing, housing for the formerly homeless, hotel and commercial conversions to residential uses, community opportunities to purchase distressed properties, and long-term preservation of existing affordable housing in the district. CD 3 also needs more family-sized affordable housing, with higher volumes of 2- and 3-bedroom affordable units than the typical affordable unit mix. In addition, the homeownership rate in CD 3 is 15.5%, which is lower than the citywide share of 33.3%.  Along with expanding affordable rental housing, there is a need to expand affordable homeownership opportunities like the kind seen in previous decades with programs like Mitchell-Lama. Sufficient funding for capital projects and housing subsidy programs from the City will be required to ensure much needed affordable housing continues to be constructed. Additionally, unnecessary administrative and bureaucratic roadblocks in the approval process are some of the largest financial costs in building new affordable homes, which often renders desirable projects financially unfeasible. Community-based organizations in CD 3 which provide essential services to tenants dealing with the termination of basic services, egregious building code violations, and avoidable evictions need expanded support to ensure tenants can remain in their homes and that existing affordable housing is protected.

","Community District 3's economic ecosystem continues to be impacted with the residual impacts from the COVID 19 shutdown.   	Retail stores, restaurants, bars, arts venues, personal care salons, hotels and many other local businesses are still recovering from significant revenue losses and continue to struggle to pay expenses such as rent, mortgages, utilities, and payroll.[1] 	Unemployment reached a high of 20 percent in May 2020 but has now dropped to 5.3 percent for New York City as of August 2023[2] Businesses now struggle to hire staff.   There was a sustained loss of independent ""mom-and-pop"" stores providing a variety of goods and services in CD 3 prior to the pandemic. As the local economy becomes more homogenous, residents must increasingly leave our community or shop online to meet basic needs-a trend that was accelerated by COVID-19.[3] Since reopening after the pandemic, there has been a slight increase in chain stores in Manhattan of just over three percent. This slight increase is reflected in CD 3. Zip Code 10009 had 22 chain stores in 2021 which increased to 26 in 2022, an 18.2% change. Zip Code 10002 currently has 39 chain stores; down from 51 stores pre-COVID in 2019.[4]  The still significant presence of these chain stores, despite the loss of 17 chain stores since 2020, has altered the character of the Lower East Side by shifting purchasing power to mass-market retailers and constructing facades out of context with the rest of the historical community.[5] Retail stores that do survive in our community are threatened by the rising costs of doing business in NYC without sufficient relief or protection from the City.

Commuting Characteristics by Sex, 2021: ACS 5-year Estimates Subject Tables. https://data.census.gov/table?q=United+States&t=Commuting&g=795XX00US3603809&tid=ACSST5Y2021.S0801). Many residents are poorly served by the subway system, with 13 percent living more than ½ mile from the nearest subway stop (NYU Furman Center. 2023. Lower East Side/Chinatown MN03. https://furmancenter.org/neighborhoods/view/lower-east-side-chinatown.). Therefore: •	There is a need for more east/west bus service south of 8th Street. The ease of East/West travel has been diminished by the elimination of the Grand Street Bus in the early 1980's and by the limited number of M14A buses. Even though the Grand Street crosstown bus was eliminated over 40 years ago, there’s still a dire need for a crosstown bus south of 8th Street. •	There is a need to take strong, creative measures in CD 3 to reduce traffic congestion, which contributes to a vicious cycle of reduced ridership and reduced service. The MTA/NYCT reduces service after ridership on a bus route drops below a certain threshold. Service cuts have a severely negative impact on vulnerable populations, including the elderly and disabled, who rely on public transportation. ","Accessibility and Safety Accessibility and pedestrian safety are a CB 3 priority, especially with 8.7 percent of residents of the area reporting ambulatory difficulty.  There are several ways to address this issue in the district:   •    Improved accessibility of bus stops, which is necessary for seniors and people with disabilities. There are complaints to the community board and observations of bus stops being used as loading zones and short-term parking, which render the stops inaccessible for those in wheelchairs and walkers. NYPD needs to enforce bus stop regulations.  Pedestrian and Traffic Safety In the first four months of 2020, 303 total injuries and two fatalities have resulted from crashes in CD 3. The density of injuries in CD 3 is high in comparison to other community districts in Manhattan and the rest of the City. The highest volume of crashes were located on:  •    East Houston Street (between Avenue A and Bowery) •    Delancey Street (between Bowery and Clinton) •    Grand Street (between Bowery and Clinton) •    Bowery (between East Houston and Delancey) •    Third Ave (between East Houston and East 10th St) Pedestrian safety improvements and traffic calming measures are needed on these key corridors and high priority intersections to reduce overall traffic crashes and ensure the safety of pedestrians on our most dangerous streets.  Delivery and Curbside Management The increased demand for deliveries driven by on-line shopping, the proliferation of cargo delivery bicycles, and the need for loading/unloading zones by local businesses necessitate planning to ensure safety. The proliferation of mid-box stores with ongoing delivery needs but without appropriate loading zones exacerbates these problems. The effect on traffic due to commercial and residential deliveries calls for overall planning by the City to address these issues and develop a plan that will allow both the steady flow of traffic and safe access to sidewalks.   ","CD 3 is underserved by public transportation despite the fact that 93 percent of workers in the district do not use a car to commute to work.[1] Many residents are poorly served by the subway system, with 13 percent living more than 1/2 mile from the nearest subway stop.[2] Therefore:   	There is a need for more east/west bus service south of 8th Street. The ease of East/West travel has been diminished by the elimination of the Grand Street Bus in the early 1980's and by the limited number of M14A buses. Even though the Grand Street crosstown bus was eliminated over 40 years ago, there's still a dire need for a crosstown bus south of 8th Street. 	There is a need to take strong, creative measures in CD 3 to reduce traffic congestion, which contributes to a vicious cycle of reduced ridership and reduced service. The MTA/NYCT reduces service after ridership on a bus route drops below a certain threshold. Service cuts have a severely negative impact on vulnerable populations, including the elderly and disabled, who rely on public transportation.       [1] U.S. Census Bureau. (2023).

","","","","","Community board resources (offices, staff, and equipment)","","Community Boards have not had a significant baseline budget expansion since 2014. The community boards need a significant budget increase to maintain their Charter-mandated duties which have become more technologically complex and costly since COVID. Boards need funding for consistent access to technology, functional office space, and expertise in land use and zoning. Most importantly, Boards need baseline funding for salaries both to hire staff with appropriate expertise and to retain staff in the competitive environment with other city agencies","CD 3, like most community districts in New York City, is underserved in terms of open space, with less than the City-recommended 2.5 acres of open space per 1000 residents.   •    Citywide the median open space ratio is 1.5 acres per 1,000 residents  - CD 3 is slightly below that average at 1.2 acres per 1,000 residents.  •    While 99 percent of residential units in CD 3 are located within 1/4 mile of a park, not all parks are easily accessible or maintained at an acceptable level.  •    Open space is not evenly distributed throughout the district, with the area west of Avenue A and Chinatown lacking adequate open space. •    With the impending closure of East River Park for a minimum of 3.5 years, other parks in CD 3 risk being inundated and over-used by people looking for alternative spaces.  Parks Buildings There are numerous Parks Department buildings in the district that are underutilized. These spaces are either completely closed or are used as store houses for citywide Parks operations. Our local park houses should not bear this disproportionate burden for other neighborhoods. These buildings would be better used as community facilities that could serve as neighborhood safe anchors thus increasing park safety.  We believe these buildings should be renovated and reopened for community use. According to a 596 Acres Study, the following properties are underutilized in the district:   •    SDR Park: The Stanton Street Park House in SDR Park was a community center until the 1970s and must be returned to community use (only the restrooms are open to the public). Three out of four Parks buildings in SDR Park are used for citywide Parks maintenance or communication centers. Public restrooms are closed in one park house and open only for limited, unsupervised and sporadic hours in the three others. This inequitable distribution of resources does not allow CD 3 to meet its needs for community space, programming and park safety, especially in this very densely used and troubled park straddling the Lower East Side and Chinatown and a Scope of Work is needed to move this forward. •    SDR Park: Hester St. Building (Used by Parks. Only the restrooms are open to public) •    Allen Street Mall Comfort Station (Completely closed. RFPs for food vendor still in progress, which would open bathrooms) •    Seward Park ""Park House"" Building (Bathrooms are open, space slated for temporary use by Lower East Side Ecology Center at the time of this writing as an East Side Coastal Resiliency project mitigation)      •    LaGuardia Houses Playground Building (demolished and converted to open turf area. However, this is a temporary conversion and Parks needs to commit to building a permanent community recreation facility.) •    Baruch Houses Bathhouse (Completely closed, RFP has been issued.) •    Tompkins Square Park Building (Bathrooms are open. the rest of the building is closed to the community.)                                Recreational Use The lack of park space is exacerbated by a lack of recreational sports fields. While CB 3 does not seek to exclude outside groups from our parks, the Board had taken the following positions:  •    Priority access to recreational sports fields should be given to not-for-profit organizations serving the youth of CD 3 especially considering the full closure of East River Park. •    NYC Parks must revisit the policy of grandfathering sports field permits to certain organizations. •    Fields must be maintained to optimize use. This includes providing drainage so that fields can be used after rain and snow.  Rodents in Parks and Community Gardens The Rat Reduction program implemented in 2017 has not shown success uniformly in CD 3, but there has been success in parks. The pandemic put a pause on the program, which was then activated in May 2021. Parks that show increased active rats signs are Columbus Park, East River Park, SDR Park, Seward Park, and Strauss Square. Tompkins Square Park and Cooper Triangle are the only parks that have shown improvement.   Wireless Access CD 3 residents would benefit greatly from free wireless access in all public parks, such as the networks currently available in Alfred E. Smith Playground, Tompkins Square Park and Hamilton Fish Park, which allow all in the community to use their laptops and other devices in parks.            Maintenance CB 3 members have routinely observed parks, playgrounds, plazas, Greenstreets, and street trees with plantings not being properly and regularly maintained or mowed. This issue has been particularly exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic as more people than ever turn to their local parks and open spaces to escape their apartments for fresh air while they shelter in place. Many CD 3 parks have become overrun with overflowing trash cans, litter, overgrown lawns (some at almost 2-feet high) and rampant weeds. All this while parks in more affluent districts are maintained in pristine condition. Therefore CB 3 requests:   •    Adequate staffing of Parks mobile maintenance staff  •    Regular maintenance of parks mechanical equipment to ensure that they are always at the ready •    More frequent cleaning of playgrounds in parks, as well as standalone park playgrounds during the weekends and on summer weekdays, especially in all spray showers and water fountains, to maintain safety and sanitation  •    Maintenance of new street trees and bioswales      Community Gardens CD 3 has one of the highest concentrations of Greenthumb gardens in New York City and the densest distribution of gardens in the city.  It is essential that our community gardens are protected. Currently gardens can still be sold as they are not legally Parks property. CB 3 supports:  •    The creation of a new Special Purpose ""Community Garden District"" that would offer a measure of protection, as would a new protected NYC zoning designation of ""Community Garden.""  Since all community gardens have the same maintenance and resource needs as public parks, CB 3 requests that:  •    All gardens under NYC Parks jurisdiction receive funding through Greenthumb and should be provided with adequate infrastructure, such as available water spigots, ongoing topsoil renewal, wrought iron fencing, and electricity/solar lighting where applicable. There should be installation of Bruckner Boxes in all parks that require them to ensure watering facilities are adequate to sustain greenery.  Keeping the gardens well-lit is a public safety need. The increase in illicit drug use, as reported by area gardeners, makes garden lighting especially relevant. Therefore:  •    For these safety reasons, an additional PEP Officer should be hired to specifically patrol the community gardens in CD 3.  Bioswales, Tree Plantings Bioswales and tree plantings (tree canopy) needs to begin now especially considering the ESCR project. Indigenous plantings should also be distributed throughout CD 3.  Waterfront Pier 42 has been partially funded, but the delayed project leaves the unfulfilled need to complete the critical  missing link of public access along Lower Manhattan's East River shoreline. Although additional funding  from the city has been provided as part of the East Side Coastal Resiliency mitigations, this is only for the  construction of temporary fields and amenities. The full masterplan approved by CB 3 in 2013 would  provide needed access to the waterfront at Pier 42 with passive recreation space, barriers to storm surges, marine habitat, and ecological education opportunities.   Composting Composting renewal and expansion of city-wide composting in parks and community gardens wherever practicable is needed to ensure that the environmental benefits of composting remain cost efficient and locally-based.   The Lower East Side Ecology Center headquartered in the East River Park Fire Boat House and the compost yard must return to East River Park to continue to serve as a model for park regenerative practices. Each week, 3,500 people contribute eight tons of food scraps to the Center's programs which divert food scraps from waste streams.     ","In CD 3, arts and cultural activities are an important means of preserving and exploring our exceptionally diverse community culture. Arts and cultural activities are also an important economic engine for our district that has a large concentration of artists and arts and cultural organizations-large and small, professional and community-based, experimental and culturally specific.  Artists, cultural workers and arts and cultural organizations of all sizes were impacted to a devastating degree by COVID-19 in 2020. The performing arts sector was one of the hardest hit industries in NYC, putting cultural workers, including performing artists and administrators, in vulnerable positions.  Many artists and cultural producers have not had an income since March 2020. The sector lost 56 percent of its total jobs between February 2020 and suffered the highest peak of sectoral unemployment in July 2020. As of April 2021, the sector has begun to slowly recover with a 11 percent improvement over July 2020. The negative economic impact on the arts and cultural sector is anticipated to last months, if not years depending on sector specificities.   City funding for small, vulnerable arts organizations is also not certain. The Department of Cultural Affairs (DCLA) primarily funds larger, well-known cultural institutions, with less funding typically awarded to small arts nonprofits located in CD 3. There is a need for equitable funding, support and resource opportunities for small local organizations in CD 3 that focus on the population most impacted by COVID-19, which are low-income people of color.    CB 3 has identified the following priority needs for Arts & Culture:  •    In May 2021, NYC announced the Artists Corps program, which was created to assist with pandemic recovery and provided a $25 million investment in grant funding for local artists across the City. This should become an ongoing program to meet the long-term needs of artists recovering from loss of income during the pandemic.  •    There is a need for more affordable and accessible workspaces for artists in CD 3. •    There is a need for more equitable funding for small and mid-sized cultural organizations, which are limited in their capacity to plan for the future since their funding is not baselined, unlike the Cultural Institutions Group (CIG). CB 3's dozens of small cultural organizations, many of which are Black, Latinx, and Chinese-run, are not members of the CIG and do not have the same access to wealthy donors. These organizations also need better access to cross-sectoral and inter-agency partnerships, which was outlined as a priority in the 2017 DCLA Cultural Plan.  •    There is a need for increased engagement with the Community Board for community space and art programming in new developments in the District. It should be encouraged that arts and culture organizations be included in the planning of City projects and new private development, such as setting aside designated arts and cultural spaces and providing opportunities for local arts and cultural organizations to be involved in the programming and design of new public spaces.      •    There is a need for CHARAS/El Bohio, a nonprofit community and cultural center that served as a much-needed axis for a local web of organizations, stakeholders and leaders that reflected the values of the communities in which they serve, to be restored in order to address a deeply felt loss in the community. ","CD 3 has five branches of the New York Public Library (NYPL) system: Chatham Square, Hamilton Fish, Ottendorfer, Seward Park, and Tompkins Square. The branches in CD 3 have amongst the highest numbers of visits in the NYPL system visits during FY20:      	 		 			 			  			 			 			Manhattan Community Board 3 			 		 		 			 			Branch 			 			 			Visits 			 			 			Program Attendance 			 		 		 			 			Chatham Square Branch 			 			 			250,155 			 			 			46, 598 			 		 		 			 			Hamilton Fish Park Branch 			 			 			118,305    			 			 			10,324 			 		 		 			 			Ottendorfer Branch 			 			 			37,447 			 			 			13,542   			 		 		 			 			Seward Park Branch 			 			 			284,370 			 			 			57,470 			 		 		 			 			Tompkins Square Branch 			 			 			  164,797 			 			 			35,370 			 		 		 			 			Totals 			 			 			855,074 			 			 			163,302 			 		 		 			  			  			  			  		 	    NYPL is currently balancing what they have learned during the pandemic about the value of digital and remote services along with reconnecting with the community. The library will be looking at new initiatives such as modifying after-school programs and supporting greater proficiency in marketable technology skills. To this end, NYPL will implement a strategy for a hybrid model of course delivery in addition to in-person and online programming. The current COVID-19 crisis has shown that our libraries are needed to meet public health, social, and economic challenges. There is a need to increase or maintain services to ensure the most vulnerable residents have access to library services six days a week and expand to seven-day service.

Portions of several well-known and economy-driven areas exist within MCD4's boundaries, including the Garment District, the Flower District, the Gansevoort Market Historic District, the Ladies' Mile Shopping District, the West Chelsea Historic District and the Theater District. Other notable sites in MCD4 include: Restaurant Row, The High Line, Columbus Circle, the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum, the Farley Building/Moynihan Station, the Lincoln Tunnel, the Port Authority Bus Terminal, the Javits Center, the Manhattan Cruise Ship Terminal, Bella Abzug Park, Manhattan West, the Vessel and The Shed at Hudson Yards, the Circle Line, the Rubin Museum, Chelsea art galleries, Maritime Piers 56-99, and the northern half of Hudson River Park.     Community District 4 Trends  In addition to acute challenges induced by the pandemic and the migrant crisis, our district was already undergoing tremendous shifts. Since 2010, the population of MCD4 has grown over 27%(1). This comes on the heels of a 20% growth between 2000 and 2010, much of it concentrated in recently rezoned areas. This rate of growth is four times faster than New York City's. The rapid increase in land value accelerated the displacement of many long- time tenants and small business owners, while the new benefits of new development are slow to materialize. Members of MCD4 have strived for balance between the redevelopment of these areas with the preservation and expansion of the district's residential neighborhoods. A major priority, highlighted by the pandemic, is ensuring that new development helps produce more permanently affordable housing. To add to the dwindling affordable housing stock is the City's lack of oversight and enforcement of building neglect by landlords. This includes illegal demolition and demolition by neglect.  Overall, the rezonings and subsequent construction has contributed to the deterioration of the quality of life of MCD4 residents. This mass of new construction is exacerbated by the development of large-scale proposals within MCD4, including Hudson Yards, Manhattan West, the Port Authority Bus Terminal, Amtrak's Gateway Tunnel proposal, and the conversion of the Farley Post Office into the new Moynihan Train Station. City Agencies' planning divisions, such as Sanitation, NYPD, and others, are slow to react to these trends and, consequently, our services and infrastructure are deficient for our rapidly growing population.  A consequence of the increased development coupled with the injection of a large migrant population is the enormous pressure put on existing public service systems in the area. Our schools and teachers are overburdened, our shelters are overflowing and our street landscape has quickly become incredibly unsafe due to unregulated electric and motorized vehicles.  Within the last couple of years, MCD4 has seen a drastic jump in street crime, much due in much to the overall economic situation as well as changes in crime prevention and enforcement. A contributing factor is the siting of homeless facilities and social other service facilities with no planning or coordination with the community. For these reasons, for the third year in a row, public safety was far and away reflected as the top priority in our district-wide survey. The city must recognize the critical need for our requested programs making our streets and neighborhoods safer, including the value of police out of their cars and walking their neighborhoods.  Contributing to our unhealthy environment, the drastic DSNY COVID cuts from the past administration has not been fully restored resulting in litter filling the district's streets and litter bins overﬂowing on corners. Trash collection continues to be a process unchanged since the 19th Century, filling sidewalks with garbage and taking space from pedestrians. It is incompatible with the new residential zoning of the surrounding neighborhoods and more needs to be done to improve public transportation in both frequency and capacity.  Our district area is consistently recorded as having some of the worst air quality in New York City. The three main factors contributing to that dubious honor is our constant building and construction, traffic congestion of diesel fuel vehicles and, most blatantly, the cruise ship emission from vessels docked at the Manhattan Cruise Terminal. The city can make great strides in curbing two of those three with immediate action our MCD4 is requesting. There is urgency in developing public electric vehicle charging lots to encourage the elimination of gas-power vehicles on our roads. And MCD4 has long been on record for the conversion to electric shore power at the Manhattan Cruise Terminal.  Community District 4 - Immediate Issues  For decades, MCB4 has been a strong advocate for affordable housing at a range of incomes. Our community believes that socioeconomic diversity and integration are the only way to keep Clinton/Hell's Kitchen, Hudson Yards and Chelsea the thriving neighborhoods they are today. This constant principal frames virtually all district need discussions and is also reflected in our Statement of District Needs priority list.  Migrant Crisis & Neighborhood Effects: Layering onto our considerable challenges resulting from Covid-19 cuts, the city has placed an exceptional amount of recent asylum seekers in our District. AS of the writing of this report, MCD4 is the final destination for approximately 40 buses a week and has been the home for one intake center, one multi-service center and six temporary shelters housing migrant populations. This comes immediately after the city relocated a disproportionately high number of single, male homeless shelter residents, many with acute needs for social service, in our district. These overlapping populations have put an inordinate strain on our District's resources, including our public schools, parks and social services. Our neighborhoods are eager to embrace our new guests and we need the financial attention to do so properly.  Illegal Cannabis Shops: The long delay between cannabis legalization and the State's issuance of the first dispensary licenses resulted in a robust industry of illegal smoke shops developing across New York City.  Taking advantage of the lack of education around legal cannabis, a number of these smoke shops are operating as unlicensed cannabis stores.  As of the Spring of 2023, more than 50 such shops have opened in the MCD4 area with the majority of these stores along Eighth and Ninth Avenues from 50th Street to 34th Street.  These unregulated, unlicensed, cash-based cannabis stores have already demonstrated they present a danger to public safety.  Robberies and gun violence have occurred at several illegal cannabis shops this year.  Additionally, unapproved products sold at unlicensed stores present a health risk to customers, particularly to minors. The majority of cannabis stores do not check for identification to ensure customers are over 21 and they implement images and neon signage which attract young people.  Lack of clarity around enforcement has allowed many of these stores to continue to operate and gain a customer base.  This puts at risk the success of legal dispensaries and the potential tax revenue that should be generated from a robust, legal cannabis market.  MCB4 was one of the first Community Boards to identify the scope of the issue and as early as July 2022. The City will need to provide resources for education and enforcement to combat the rise of unlicensed cannabis stores and the risk they pose to our community.  E-Bikes & Moped Use: In MCD4 the sheer volume of cyclists, pedestrians, delivery requests and delivery workers creates a growing hazard for the community. The rapid growth of delivery cyclists also called ""deliveristas"" is driven by the COVID era behavior of ordering products instead of picking them up at the store. This coincides with incredible growth of the app based delivery market. In the last three months of 2021, zip code 10019 in Manhattan district 4, ranked second highest in New York City for online deliveries.  Zip code 10001 also in District 4 ranked very high. Neither our infrastructure nor our institutions have been adjusted to this new reality. Senior citizens and people with disabilities are most at risk as there are many cyclists, including Citibike cyclists, who ride on the sidewalk. The increased use of e-bikes and mopeds as modes of transportation have heightened the risks to all populations.  Additionally this practice is a contributing factor to increased use of plastic containers and accumulation of garbage within our district.  To combat these issues, resources are needed for both enforcement and education, particularly for the asylum seekers that are housed within our community and are actively engaged in the gig economy as ""deliveristas."" While this is a new phenomenon, the number of fatalities  and injuries of pedestrians and cyclists due to vehicular collisions is at its highest in years and also requires additional resources in street design and enforcement.  Continued Deteriorating Street Life Conditions: Policy changes and budget cuts implemented during the onset of the pandemic have resulted in an increase in open drug use, street homelessness, shoplifting, rats and overflowing litter baskets still prevalent in our district today. The reductions in policing, sanitation, DOB enforcement coupled with the disproportionate placement of shelter residents and asylum seekers has noticeably changed the character of our neighborhoods.  Our large numbers of vulnerable populations have attracted predators which has taken parts of our neighborhoods back to earlier eras where homelessness and drug use overwhelmed our streets.  And while some funding was ultimately restored for a number of city-wide enrichment and social service programs, MCD4 still faces significant public safety challenges, a high rate of commercial vacancies and unsanitary street conditions. Though office foot traffic has changed considerably since the pandemic, MCD4 encompasses significant tourist attractions and economic generators for the whole of New York City.  For the opportunity to fully recover from the economic blow due to COVID-19, the City will need to recognize the accumulative effect of these issues and apply a comprehensive approach to applying resources.  Manhattan District 4's Priorities Include:    	Ensuring safe surroundings that allows all &ndash; residents, visitors, and businesses -- to thrive, feel secure and live in a fear-free environment; 	Prioritizing public safety with crime prevention resources including ""street beat"" NYPD presence; Preserving affordable housing and creating additional affordable housing for people making a broad range of incomes (including Very Low, Low, Middle and Moderate); 	Maintaining neighborhood character and preventing displacement and eviction of residents and small businesses including checks of bad-faith landlords and illegal demolition; 	Providing adequate trash & recycling pick up service and policies and keeping our streets in clean and healthy conditions; 	Providing education, registration and enforcement regarding E-bike and moped use; 	Providing education and enforcement to combat the proliferation of illegal cannabis shops; 	Maintaining the stability of a long-standing local retail presence in our communities and preserving affordable commercial space for businesses, community, arts and cultural groups; 	Developing a coherent safe, reliable, accessible, affordable and connected transportation infrastructure for our district, including increasing public safety in transportation, strengthening, and improving public bus and rapid transit systems and fostering a better balance in street usage between pedestrians, bicycles and vehicles, particularly buses, all with the goal of improving connectivity and efficiency; 	Building new elementary and middle schools, to combat overcrowding and accommodate the rapidly increasing (+30%) school-age population; 	Provide requisite staff including bilingual support, and facility space for our public schools; 	Renovating and creating additional green spaces, including electric charging hubs, to combat the lack of parkland and green infrastructure; 	Increasing services to the homeless, seniors, people with disabilities, and youth; Addressing the quality of life issues associated with construction and outdoor dining; 	Working with the City to ensure its commitments generated by previous rezoning actions (affordable housing, parks, arts spaces,) are completed within a timeframe that addresses the looming threats of gentrification.

This includes demolition restrictions, illegal hotel conversion and harassment of tenants by landlords. Only recently have state laws been strengthened to preserve and protect the existing aﬀordable housing stock. This stock has also been confronted by a tremendous increase in the development of new market rate and luxury housing. Of continued signiﬁcant importance is the preservation and creation of aﬀordable housing at all income bands. With our middle and working class dwindling, aﬀordable units across the board are essential to our district. We also strongly advocate for a much greater amount of multi-bedroom units to keep families in place and family living aﬀordable. Recently, our Community Board released our Aﬀordable Housing Plan detailing our trends and needs. Meanwhile, we must all commit to implementing the NYCHA working group recommendations for Harborview, Elliot Chelsea, and Fulton Houses NYCHA developments.","Crime and Public Safety","","In our recent district-wide survey, public safety was far and away the number one concern in our area. Our Community Board continues to hear public outcry over the state of their streets and subways. The still lingering eﬀects of COVID and subsequent policies has dramatically increased the prevalence of theft and severity of substance abuse related issues, as well as homelessness, in MCD4. Additional support for mental health outreach, more funding for increased foot patrols and overall improved coordination with MCD4 stakeholders is needed in the district. We request more oﬃcers be patrolling the streets by foot at regular intervals and be visible to the population; an additional goal is to reduce the response time for complaints and to improve coordination with the community. Some of this illicit activity is occurring in our parks therefore, we also request more Park Enforcement Patrol (PEPs officers) to help keep our parks clean and safe. ","Trash removal and cleanliness","","Trash removal & cleanliness Sanitation/Quality of Life: “Make sanitation dept. budget a super priority, quality of life issues will improve” was one of many like-minded comments that appeared in our district survey responses. Since our drastic COVID related sanitation cuts, our neighborhood hasn’t been the same. Dirty and unhealthy conditions including overﬂowing trash bins, increased rodent activity, garbage and syringe-strewn streets and a general lack of attention has sharply deteriorated the quality of life in our district. This environment is not just unsightly, it’s hazardous. MCD4 is the gateway into NYC for many travelers. Our street conditions are hindering our economy and livability. We prioritize the clean up of our district, including a greater DSNY presence, organics collection and corner basket recycling, and ask the city pay special attention to the quality of life issues that make our spaces habitable.","","","","","Services to reduce or prevent homelessness","","Services to reduce or prevent homelessness Homelessness became a major issue in MCD4 over the last several years, having been signiﬁcantly exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The large number of emergency hotel shelter sites, social services sites and large transportation hubs located within MCD4, including the Port Authority Bus Terminal and Moynihan Train Hall, mean that the district has natural gathering places for unsheltered individuals and others with social services needs. MCD4's location and built environment results in a large number of people with high social services needs, including mental health and substance abuse needs with insufficient support or treatment options. Though the COVID-19 emergency is now over, MCD4 is one of the major recipients of migrants needing emergency temporary shelter. This year, MCD4 became a drop-oﬀ, intake and housing point for a large portion of the hundred thousand of asylum seekers traveling to New York City with no notice. While MCB4 acknowledges the emergency nature of the current asylum seeker crisis, moving forward, it is vital to work with the community to plan appropriate locations, sizes and other considerations for future facilities. ","Health Care: The city has placed an exceptional number of recent asylum seekers in our District. MCD4 is the destination for approximately 40 buses a week and has been the home for one intake center, one multi-service center and six temporary shelters housing migrant populations, in particular families with children. The local community health clinic are overburdened and need both capital and expense funding to provide the needed family health care.   HIV/AIDS: The number of people living with HIV/AIDS in the Clinton\Hell's Kitchen and Chelsea neighborhoods continues to be disproportionately high compared to other neighborhoods. The recent re-opening of the Chelsea Sexual Health Clinic along with long-standing community partners in our district, i.e., Ryan-Chelsea Clinton Community Health Center, Callen-Lorde, and Gay Men's Health Crisis, are crucial partners in this fight, but more resources are needed for the e orts to make PrEP, PEP, and rapid HIV testing more accessible to all members of our community district. Public awareness campaigns around safe sex and sexual health should also be expanded.   ","According to the US Bureau of the Census, as of 2020, there are 17,000 individuals (12.9%) over 65 years of age living in the Chelsea/Clinton Neighborhoods. The number of people over age 65 began to increase substantially beginning in 2011 as the oldest members of the baby-boom generation reach the 65-year mark. The number of people age 65 or older will nearly double between 2000 and 2030. To better understand the growing needs of our seniors, in 2013, the MCD4 partnered with The Actors Fund (a human service organization for the performing arts with many constituents living in MCD4), the Visiting Nurse Service of New York and the Rodney Kirk Center of Manhattan Plaza (a 1700 unit Section 8 building with over 1100 seniors) to conduct a survey of seniors residing in MCD4. The survey identified several main priorities: Education/Outreach to seniors about the increase of SCRIE A campaign to identify and promote Age Friendly local business Expansion of affordable mental health services for seniors and medical home visit programs Support services for caregivers of the frail elderly A housing agenda for older New Yorkers. Additionally, the Community Needs Assessment completed in 2020 also concluded that seniors were one of the groups needing additional support specifically related to housing, finances, technology, transportation needs, translation services, and community space. Additional needs for people with disabilities According to the 2010 Census there has been an 8.3 percent growth in our district of people with disabilities. The Committee identified several main priorities: Affordable Housing: Increase the proportion of affordable housing units in the community for people with disabilities. Tenant Education: Making sure residents living with disabilities know federal, state, and local housing laws and property owners' responsibilities to provide ADA access and accommodations. Additional city agencies must make all sidewalks and city owned facilities accessible.   ","Homelessness has become a major issue in MCD4 over the last several years and is among the most frequently raised issues since the start of the pandemic. Large public facilities located within MCD4, such as the Port Authority Bus Terminal and Penn Station are a natural gathering places for people without homes. Many of the homeless population need social services specifically around substance use and mental health treatment. The presence of very large homeless shelters, such as BRC, and drug rehabilitation centers has also brought major stress to the community. MCB4 are open to homeless shelters in our district, however, significant consideration should be given to the location and size of any shelter opening in our community. ","According to the NYU Furman Center, MCB4 represents the interests of the neighborhoods with one of the highest levels of income inequality in New York City. Our district is also home to three large public housing developments: the Chelsea-Elliot Houses, the Robert Fulton Houses, and Harborview Terrace. MCB4's 2020 Community Needs Assessment found that families living in public housing or rent controlled units need affordable retailers such as grocery stores. As stated in an October 2017 letter, the Board is deeply concerned there are only four vendors in our district who participate in the Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), all who happen to be small businesses. More resources are needed to help MCB4 residents access WIC providers and help more grocery stores become authorized WIC vendors. https://cbmanhattan.cityofnewyork.us/cb4/all-committees/mcb4-community-needs/ ","","","","","Educational attainment","","Student achievement citywide has improved since last year. Math scores have increased from 37.9 percent in 2022 to 49.9 percent in 2023 while ELA proficiency has risen from 49 percent to 51.7 percent. In Schools District 2 (which includes CB4) enrollment is up 7% with many schools meeting or exceeding their enrollment targets. The student in temporary housing population has increased from 500 to an estimated 1,700 to 1,900 with a large number of these students residing in CB4 shelters. Our schools and families responded quickly to the waves of families seeking asylum to meet their basic needs and now a shift is being made to provide these students with a strong educational foundation. There is a continued need for teachers and teaching assistants who have language skills in Spanish, Ukrainian, and Arabic to serve our growing diverse population of English language learners as well as a need for free after school programming in all elementary schools.  In addition, many of our schools buildings are suffering from crumbling infrastructure. Roofs are leaking water into classrooms; bathrooms need updating; more safe water fountains are needed; many buildings are still not completely ADA accessible; and many need technology upgrading. Students need laptops and tablets to do their homework and to have language access and support when not in school in order to meet their basic educational standards.","In addition to most students struggling academically and many experiencing the effects of disruption to their social-emotional development, our board has also heard from the community about other major challenges the public school system is working to address the growing number of immigrants and asylum seekers recently coming to New York City. There is an enormous need for more afterschool programing as well as spanish speaking social workers and teachers. Accessing student transportation is an ongoing struggle for many families, especially those in temporary housing. Changes to housing accommodations often cause several days of delay before students are able to be scheduled for regular bus pickups, leading to loss of school days. The current number of existing and planned schools in MCD4 is not meeting the demand for seats of school-age children who are currently living in our community and the expected increase in students from all the newresidential developments. As development continues, more children will enter our district schools, impacting schools already operating at full and at over capacity. Funds need to be allocated to both acquire space for new schools and upgrade existing facilities. A great number of our school buildings are suffering from crumbling infrastructure. Roofs are leaking into classrooms; bathrooms need updating; some buildings are still not completely ADA accessible; and many need tech upgrading.   ","Students living in temporary shelters have specific needs that require supportive social services from the city. Their schools need to have permanent on-site social workers to help address the challenges they and their families are experiencing.  Our students could also benefit from workforce development programs and educational programs that promote socioeconomic mobility. As our district's population continues to become more diverse, continued effort should be made to further diversify the educator workforce in our school's teaching and administrative staff, which research has shown will improve academic outcomes, improve attendance and decrease suspensions. Our students with thinking and learning differences must be provided with additional support and all students should have test preparation available to them.   Our priority is to provide each of our students with access to the resources  that will enable them to perform at the level they are capable of academically and develop the skills they will need for success in continuing education and the 21st century workplace. ","","","","","General crime","","While the City experienced a spike in violent crime over the past few years, our district has been fortunate to see most major crime down across MCD4 precincts.  However, the impact of increased open drug use, shoplifting, pickpocketing, package theft and traffic infractions including two-wheeled vehicles has increased.  Many of these issues fall under ‘quality of life’ concerns, but in aggregate these infractions threaten the sense of safety for residents and visitors alike.  One exception is Midtown South which has one of the highest numbers of narcotics arrests in all of New York City.  Many of those that are arrested are recidivists that continue to find our communities a comfortable place to operate.  Required resources to help improve these conditions are increased staffing for “beat cops” and improved EBike/moped enforcement. Relatedly, support for Midtown Court so they could operate at full strength has been an effective tool against recidivism. ","With the development of the Hudson Yards, a 50% growth in population in the last 20 years, the addition of tens of thousands of residents, high traffic tourist destinations (the Vessel, Bella Abzug Park, Whitney Museum, High line) and commuter ﬂows (#7 subway, Lincoln tunnel and Bus terminal), increased deliveries (Whole Foods/Amazon, USPS, FedEx and UPS distribution centers in our districts) and schools (Avenues, Success Academy, PS 33) our current precincts are stretched to the limit.  The four distinct precincts that service our district creates barriers to resolving public safety issues across our communities and MCB4 has long advocated for reorganizing the precinct footprints to better serve the district. The significant increase of residential and commercial populations along with the increase in crime in the district require a better distribution of resources and a more nimble structure. The consideration of a substation 10th Precinct NYPD facility, particularly in the Hudson Yards area, will provide better coordination and service across the entire district. ","As the Westside of Manhattan has become more residential with larger and larger residential buildings being built, additional FDNY/EMS and NYPD facilities and services are needed in this growing area.  These new facilities will need to be more streamlined, energy efficient and overall more accessiable.  ","","","","","Cleanliness/trash collection","","Some of the most obvious and visible neighborhood deterioration relates to DSNY and the deleterious conditions of our streets and curbsides. The profound amount of trash overﬂowing corner bins, stacked up on sidewalks and scattered all across our public spaces is unacceptable. This is resulting in uninviting, unhealthy and sickening conditions. Poor garbage storage and pickup has led to a serious pest control problem and increased litter making its way into streets, waterways, and parks. Sites for commercial garbage storage must be developed wherever possible oﬀ-street to be used until shortly before pick-up. MCD4 prioritizes rectifying these repulsive conditions with more frequent corner basket collection, corner basket recycling and an overall commitment to getting our city clean again. We also highlight the increased sightings of used syringes and drug vials in parks, streets, sidewalks and tree beds. The need to restore a robust syringe collection unit is critical. In addition, MCB4's Sanitation Planning Working Group produced a report with a number of recommendations to streamline the storage and management of residential trash and recycling.  MCB4 Sanitation Planning Working Group Recommendations:  https://cbmanhattan.cityofnewyork.us/cb4/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2022/09/05-NB-MCB4-SPWG-Recommendations-1.pdf","The entire coastline of MCD4 and portions of the West Chelsea Historic District is categorized as High-Risk Flood Zones. As climate change brings greater threats to the city and our coastline, more of MCD4 will be at higher risk. Our antiquated sewer and water system with combined sewer overﬂows needs updating, as climate change inundates the system and forces raw sewage into the streets and basements of buildings. Upgrading the sewer system is a decades-long undertaking.   MCD4 is especially concerned about the southern and western areas of MCD4 and the entrances to the Lincoln and Amtrak tunnels. According to the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, this community suﬀers the second highest incidents of chronic lung disease of any community in Manhattan south of Harlem. Given the proximity of the Chelsea and Clinton/Hell's Kitchen neighborhoods to the Lincoln Tunnel, the Port Authority Bus Terminal and the Manhattan Cruise Terminal, MCD4 is at particular risk from unhealthy air.   Another major cause of air pollution in MCD4 is carbon emissions from buildings still using ""dirty boilers"" that burn heating oil #4 and #6. Many of the buildings using these dirty boilers are rent- regulated and cannot (or will not) pay for the cost of converting to cleaner alternatives. Noise complaints from MCD4 consistently rank among the highest registered by DEP and are rising, especially at night.   Unchecked conditions of outdoor dining have exacerbated the problem of street noise, pollution, rats and pedestrian space. With the increase in restaurants in the district, accompanying sidewalk obstructions (multiple sandwich boards, menus stands, plants, etc.) have appeared on the sidewalk making it nearly impossible for pedestrians to navigate on the sidewalk on Ninth Avenue, north of 34th Street and on 8th Avenue. Increased enforcement is required to ensure a safe pedestrian experience. ","The board is very concerned with the frequency of pick-up of garbage in the public wastebaskets that are often overflowing and attracting rodents. This situation has worsened and seen no improvement from previous years and needs immediate attention. With the increase in restaurants in the district, accompanying sidewalk obstructions (multiple sandwich boards, menus stands, plants, etc.) have appeared on the sidewalk making it nearly impossible for pedestrians to navigate on the sidewalk on Ninth Avenue, north of 34th Street and on 8th Avenue. Increased enforcement is required to ensure a safe pedestrian experience. ","","","","","Affordable housing creation","","Increased pressures from re-zoning and development have diminished existing aﬀordable housing stock. In addition, through illegal demolition, illegal hotel conversion, and harassment, aﬀordable housing stock has shrunk. The commitments to create new aﬀordable housing continue to be unmet. As a result, more permanently aﬀordable units for individuals and families of diﬀerent income bands are necessary for our community.  The MCD4 Aﬀordable Housing Plan oﬀers a roadmap for fulﬁlling and developing more aﬀordable housing units to all income bands, as do plans for mixed use and commercial conversion. In particular, MCB4 calls on the Department of City Planning and the Department of Housing Preservation and Development to work with MCB4 to stop the demolition of residential units in the special districts within our boundaries and support the rezoning of 11th Avenue from West 34th street to West 41st Street to allow for more residential units to be built.   https://cbmanhattan.cityofnewyork.us/cb4/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2020/01/Affordable-Housing-Plan-Summary-of-Sites-12.15.22.pdf    ","Years after both Hudson Yards and West Chelsea in 2005 and the Western Rail Yards in 2009, construction is in full swing, but many City commitments remain unﬁlled. Several items agreed to by the developers, the Administration, and the City Council await completion, including many aﬀordable housing units. They need the commitment of ﬁnancial resources from both the expense and capital budgets to support staﬀ and implementation from the Department of City Planning), Economic Development Corporation, Housing Preservation and Development, and other relevant agencies. ","MCD4's Aﬀordable Housing Plan states that aﬀordable housing within the district is critical to the diverse population of artists, students, minimum wage, earners, and seniors. This mixed population includes many of the frailest and isolated members of our community and the backbone of the service and cultural economy essential to NYC. The City must free up subsidies to replenish the inventory of aﬀordable housing units in Chelsea & Hell's Kitchen. MCD4 has developed a detailed plan to generate and preserve almost 10,000 units in our district. Unfortunately, MCD4 stands to lose a signiﬁcant amount of aﬀordable housing due to expiring use in the immediate future. In addition, our district has been plagued by the illegal demolition of buildings that were ""protected"" by zoning enacted mainly due to the eﬀorts of this Community Board. We have been ﬁghting against these illegal demolitions, but the City needs to step up and do its part. It is unacceptable that 150 aﬀordable housing units have already been lost because of dishonest landlords and inactive agencies. MCD4 faces additional problems from being home to the City's second greatest amount of illegal bed and breakfast conversions. Such usage is prevalent in rent-regulated housing and buildings that beneﬁt from tax abatement programs such as 421- and J-51. The largest concentration of SRO housing in our community lies between 8th and 9th Avenues from W. 42nd to W. 57th Streets. In that area, 62 buildings contain nearly 2,200 SRO units. West 51st Street alone includes 12 buildings with a total of 574 units. West 46th Street has 21 buildings with 289 units.  https://cbmanhattan.cityofnewyork.us/cb4/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2020/01/MCB4-Affordable-Housing-Plan-Summary-of-Sites-10.26.22.pdf  NYCHA and Chelsea NYCHA Working Group   From the Fall of 2019 through the Spring of 2021 MCB4 participated in the Chelsea NYCHA Working Group. The Group included tenant representatives from the two NYCHA developments in the Chelsea area (Elliot Chelsea and Fulton Developments).  The Group included a Deputy Mayor, the Chair of NYCHA, NYCHA administration, local Elected Oﬃcials, local stakeholders and both NYCHA tenant associations. The Group's goal was to devise and agree on a future development & ﬁnanicing plan to ensure the two developments had the capital resources needed to restore the building and preserve the long term affordability for the tenants while providing opportunities for additional development.  The Group produced a report which laid out a detailed plan and delivered it to the NYCHA and the City (see enclosed).  NYCHA  issued an RFP for renovation, refinancing and new development with the NYCHA residents part of the selection process to choose the developer.  MCB4 feels conﬁdent that this plan and process will result in resolving long standing capital and expense needs for both NYCHA and the tenants of Eliot Chelsea and Fulton Houses. For these reasons, MCB4 did not include a budget request for Chelsea Elliot and Fulton Houses.   https://cbmanhattan.cityofnewyork.us/cb4/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2020/12/CB4_ChelseaNYCHA_SlideshowEngagement_final_12-16-20.pptx.pdf  https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/nycha/downloads/pdf/Chelsea-NYCHA-WG-Report-Final.pdf    ","More than a decade after the rezoning of the Hudson Yards (2005) and West Chelsea (2007), and nearly a decade after the rezoning of the Western Rail Yards (2009), buildings have been built; residents have moved in. Businesses have opened, but the much-promised resources for housing and infrastructure have not been delivered: many of the City's commitments remain unfulﬁlled. New York City is struggling compared to other big US cities to recover from the economic impact of the pandemic.  footnote: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-23/nyc-s-recovery-trails-other-u-s-cities-as-tourism-loss-weighs  Remote work and the increase of crime, particularly in our transit system are impacting businesses of every size throughout our District.  Measures need to be taken to support local businesses, reduce empty storefronts and increase workforce development programs to retrain workers for the jobs that are available. ","","","","","Pedestrian safety (safer crossings, sidewalk management, etc.)","","Pedestrian safety (safer crossings, sidewalk management, etc.) Vehicular traffic has significantly increased on our avenues. Traffic of electric bikes and mopeds has exploded. Speed cameras should be installed on all avenues and rumble strips on bike lanes to make sure vehicles and motorcycles respect the 25 MPH speed limit. Split phase signals must be installed at every left turn movement. Green phase of signals should be adjusted so that gridlock is reduced and a green wave for cyclists and pedestrians to reduce the running of red lights by cyclists. Trucks and buses are a looming presence on residential streets. Due to sidewalk obstructions, including delivery bikes that do not have any parking, pedestrians are forced to compete with each other for every inch of walkable sidewalk and are often forced to walk in traffic, bike corrals should be installed in parking lanes and sidewalks widened. Bus service continues to deteriorate, and more dedicated bus lines are needed on 9th and 10th Avenue. There is less and less space for charter bus parking and it is urgent to build the garage that was promised during the Hudson Yards rezoning. The current on-street facilities for buses and commuter vans are inadequate, and environmental pollution is a constant quality of life complaint and threat to public health.","Pedestrian safety continues to be a dominant concern that is still not properly addressed. Speed cameras, split phase signals and proper crossing times must be installed as well as cameras to deter gridlock. Due to insuﬃcient capacity and sidewalk obstructions, pedestrians are forced to compete for every inch of walkable sidewalk and are often forced to walk in traﬃc. Compounding the issue, pedestrian ramps are poorly maintained. Trucks and buses are a looming presence on residential streets. The current on-street facilities for buses and commuter vans are inadequate, and environmental pollution is a constant quality of life complaint and threat to public health. There is less and less space for charter bus parking and it is urgent to build the garage that was promised during the Hudson Yards rezoning. It is impossible to discuss transportation infrastructure without stressing the need to use and install necessary green methods. All projects to better our streets and thoroughfares must use ""green friendly"" materials such as bioswales and permeable, porous substances. In addition, we request the city's swift action in providing public access to level 3 electric vehicle charging stations in order to enable the conversion of vehicles fleets to electric (private, public and commercial vehicles). Incentives should be used to accelerate the creation of this essential electric infrastructure. ","Bus service continues to deteriorate, and more dedicated bus lanes are needed on 9th Avenue and 42nd Street. With numerous high-rise oﬃce constructions already completed on the far west side, building the West 41st Street subway station is becoming imperative to reduce the proliferation of jitneys and congestion. Scores of workers coming to and from Brooklyn need additional modes of transportation, such as ferry service must be enhanced to include a route from Brooklyn to the west side. And more ADA enabled taxis and for hire vehicles are needed to improve transit for ADA and seniors. ","","","","","Other - Write In (Required)","","Insuﬃcient park or open space: The huge inﬂux in the number of residents, including the large number of migrants to our MCD4 district, means our spaces are overburdened. Thus, support for our parks cannot be an afterthought but must be prioritized. We would like to emphasize our expectation of this administration’s promise to allot 1% of the City’s overall budget to Parks. Run down conditions must be brought back up to acceptable standards and a commitment to funding Parks staff a necessity, including Park Enforcement Patrol to curb illicit park activity. As an important highlight, public bathrooms should be installed throughout our district and a mainstay in parks. As we move forward with construction, renovations and installations, we expect a greener, more climate friendly infrastructure to be automatic.  Libraries: The New York Public Library provides critical public services to our community. For newly arrived immigrants, the NYPL is a great resource providing adults with ESL classes, courses in technology and employment seeking skills. Increased funding is essential to the NYPL in order for it to meet the needs of new immigrants and asylum seekers.  The Columbus and Muhlenberg branches are undergoing substantial repairs that require them to close. In addition, delayed maintenance has greatly increased the cost of these repairs. We urge the NYPL to address needed repairs as they surface and communicate more proactively as well as to provide more details about why certain projects and branches are selected as priorities.  Arts & Culture: Post-pandemic, independent and small theaters continue to close or lose their spaces as did the New Federal Theater this past year. We urge the Department of Cultural Affairs and the Mayor’s Office of Media & Entertainment to help locate affordable rehearsal and production spaces in our district in order to help boost audience attendance. In addition, we encourage the Mayor’s Office of Ethnic & Community Media to increase the city’s advertising spending that is specifically directed to the local community media.","Restroom facilities in three major parks have not been upgraded in years, while other recreational facilities have been. Some parks received a renovation while bathrooms went untouched. This has resulted in bringing more people into our parks but not providing adequate comfort stations. Restrooms must be upgraded at all parks within MCD4. Such upgrades will also allow DPR to provide a full-time, on-site park keeper to address constituents' concerns, provide security and perform routine maintenance. Funding should also be dedicated to support Green Thumb Community Gardens, composting, and pruning for street trees. Funding should also be directed towards full- time gardeners, maintenance workers, PEP oﬃcers, as well as seasonal aides and playground associates for the summer. ","The presence of performing arts groups develop and give voice to new talent in areas of writing, performing, dancing, choreography, and directing. This vitalizes our New York City and our community, both culturally and commercially, on a block-to-block level. In addition, support services for theater and other artistic services within MCD4 in the areas of rental storage space for art, costumes, scenery, lighting, and rehearsal studios have long been located throughout Chelsea and Clinton/Hell's Kitchen. These services are also losing viable space due to development and real estate costs. The money generated from these industries provides employment and maintains the artistic life of the city. The Board is concerned with the loss of artists' studios in the District and the displacement of working artists. ","Supporting and expanding the role of libraries as continuous learning and job centers. ","Since the 1990s, budgets (outside of personnel services) have not been re-evaluated for inﬂation. Community Boards are repeatedly asked to do more with less and that cannot continue to happen. In the age of Zoom meetings and the need for hybrid meetings, Community board funding must be increased. ","","","","","Cannabis Enforcement:  Although we acknowledge that licensing of sales of Cannabis is within the State's purview and that the associated enforcement powers generally fall to the Office of Cannabis Management, the City can do more to identify illicit stores and seize illegal products.   The Future of Small Theaters:  To ensure that small theaters continue to play an integral role in New York City's cultural landscape and economy, we believe it is imperative to complete an updated study with the objective of understanding how to stimulate economic growth and sustainability during a time when audiences are shrinking.

Our boundaries extend from Lexington to 8th Avenues and 14th to 59th Streets. Within CB5's jurisdiction, one can find some of New York City's most famous and iconic areas and buildings, such as Times Square, Central Park, the Flatiron Building, the Empire State Building, Rockefeller Center and Grand Central Terminal.   Population  According to the 2020 Census, the residential population of CB5 has been growing steadily with an estimated population of 63,600 which is an increase of 23% over 2010. The 2020 Census also indicates the population is becoming more diverse with the share of Hispanic, Asian and Black residents more than doubling from the 2010 Census.   While CB5 has a much smaller residential population than many community districts, it should be noted that the area is host to many of the millions of tourists that visit New York each year.  The District also caters to over one million workers that commute into Manhattan each week.  CB5 is crisscrossed by nearly all subway lines, and the Port Authority Bus Terminal, located just beyond our western border, makes us a focal point for the city's significant pedestrian and vehicular traffic.    Housing  According to the Census, between 2010 and 2020 CB5 has added 5,773 additional units of housing representing a 15.8% increase in housing stock in the District.  During this same time period, the District also saw a significant increase in the number of vacant housing units.  The combination of smaller existing units into larger units as well as the demolition of old housing stock has contributed to the loss of affordable units in the District.  Manhattan has the highest share of  housing density in the country at 62%(as per Construction Coverage).   Tourism  After experiencing a dearth of tourism during the COVID period, Manhattan is on track to welcome over 61 million tourists in 2023.  As the hub for many of these visitors, CB5 boasts a number of hotels, theaters, entertainment spaces, restaurants, and stores, as well as iconic attractions such as the Stephen A. Schwarzman Building and the Empire State Building.  CB5 has seen over 21 new hotels added to the current stock within the District to service the influx of visitors. While CB5 welcomes these visitors as they influence the unique character of the District while recognizing that the large number of individuals visiting the District also poses challenges.  Commercial Spaces  Manhattan has seen record high vacancy rates with 22.4% of its commercial space empty as of the first quarter of 2023 much of it within the boundaries of CB5;  District is facing above borough averages for commercial vacancies.  While this is attributable to more flexible work offerings from employers, new data from the Partnership for New York City indicates that more people are returning to their offices with 58% of pre pandemic Manhattan office workers in the workplace on an average weekday. The Partnership reports that the expectation is that this will grow to 59% on a long-term basis.  According to the New York City Council Data team, some of the highest storefront vacancy rates are found in the Midtown Manhattan business areas due to rising rents, changing consumer habits and the growth of e-commerce. In terms of neighborhood vacancies, Turtle-Bay-East Midtown, which partially lies in CB5, has the highest storefront vacancy rate at 19.8% while Midtown-Midtown South comes a close second with over 550 vacant storefronts.    Homelessness  As of June 2023,  there were over 100,000 people living in New York City shelters with thousands more living on the street including nearly 19,000 families with children. The city's homeless population is now the highest it has been since the Great Depression.  While the City increased expenditure aimed at addressing the homeless crisis in 2022, the outcomes have been underwhelming. The directives succeeded in relocating only 119 individuals out of the 2,308 homeless New Yorkers residing in encampments to the shelter system. This represents a 5% success rate as per the Comptroller's most recent report. Yet the report further notes that just three of those moved to the shelter system ended up in permanent housing.  There is often a visible homeless population within CB5 particularly around the Penn Station area and the vicinity of Port Authority Bus Terminal.  These areas are heavily trafficked, with a significant number of transportation hubs and public spaces, which can attract individuals experiencing homelessness.  According to data from the New York City Department of Homeless Services, one of the areas in Manhattan with the highest rates of homelessness is Midtown, the center of CB5.  It is generally reported that a substantial portion of the homeless population experiences mental illness. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) has reported that around 25% of people experiencing homelessness in the United States have a serious mental illness which means plans to address homelessness necessarily must include mental health services.   Migrants  Over 130,600 migrants have arrived in New York City since 2022 and the City is using a landmarked former hotel within CB5 as its primary migrant intake center. While the City is currently operating over 140 emergency shelters and eight humanitarian relief centers, several located in CB5, it is currently not able to fully address migrant needs and has sought authorization to limit the entitlement to shelter.   Even prior to the request to limit shelter accommodation, CB5 has seen long lines outside of the Roosevelt Hotel with migrants, at times, sleeping outside on the sidewalk.  And as migrants continue to arrive into the City in record numbers, it is unclear how the City will process, at this single Midtown location, these new arrivals along with those who return for processing after their limited entitlement is exhausted.  Hotels within CB5 have been converted to use for migrants and many are currently being used to house migrant families with children, many who attend local CB5 schools.    Micro mobility  CB5 has seen an increase in bicycle lanes including the transformation of Broadway between Herald Square and Madison Square Park along with the pedestrian mall created on Broadway between 42nd Street and 47th Street that provided room for cyclists.  Along with this, CB5 has experienced a proliferation of various forms of micro-mobility usage including bicycles, e-bikes, electric scooters, e-scooters and mopeds an complaints include the use of these vehicles on the sidewalk,riders  riding in the wrong direction on roads and in bike lanes and failing to obey traffic laws.  Complaints about the parking of a large number of these vehicles have been registered around the Roosevelt Hotel as well as areas in which operators congregate.  Locations where micro mobility vehicles may be permitted to park so as to minimize concentration in any one area are necessary.  Open Restaurants  The Open Restaurants program that allowed restaurants to expand outdoor dining space to accommodate more patrons safely during COVID has been made permanent.  As one of the Districts perhaps most impacted by this program, CB5 created an Open Restaurant Task Force to consider the impact of this program upon the District.  The Task Force has issued recommendations at how the Open Restaurants may best serve the District and has called for neighborhood environmental impact statements as well as the ability to weigh in on the operation of the program including give backs for use of the public realms such as public bathrooms.  Penn Station   The revitalization of Penn Station is a major project within the District.  The station is one of the busiest stations in the US, and has been a significant and ongoing urban redevelopment project aimed at transforming and improving the transportation hub and the surrounding area in New York City. Penn Station serves as a central transit point for Amtrak, Long Island Rail Road (LIRR), and New Jersey Transit, as well as the New York City Subway.   The  multi-phase, multi-year project is part of ongoing efforts aimed at achieving a more efficient, attractive, and functional transportation center and  is part of a broader urban redevelopment initiative to improve public transportation in New York City.    The primary goals of the revitalization effort are to improve passenger experience, modernize the facilities, and restore the grandeur of the original Penn Station. It aims to address the overcrowding and congestion issues, enhance transit connectivity, and create a more welcoming and efficient space for commuters and travelers.  CB5 created the Community Led Improvement Plan (CLIP) Task Force to address this project which will have an indelible impact upon CB5.  Several resolutions have been adopted and work is on-going to help engage the community as well as develop recommendations to address current plans including the development of the public realm.  Cannabis  Since cannabis became legal for adults 21 and older to possess, thousands of unlicensed cannabis shops have opened in New York City without regard to their legality.  As CB5 is required to weigh in and vote on every potential cannabis location, similar to the liquor license process, and has limited time to review each application and offer their opinion to the state, the CB5 SLAP committee convened a Cannabis Task Force.  The task force developed comprehensive rules to balance the needs of the community with public safety concerns, while ensuring any proposed locations are appropriate and run by responsible operators. The rules promulgated by the task force will be used by the CB5's SLAP committee as a blueprint to evaluate any cannabis retail application which provides transparency in decision-making and clarity for those coming before the Board to request approval.  By developing and following these clear and comprehensive rules, CB5 seeks to ensure that pot shops operate responsibly, comply with regulations, and minimize any negative impacts on the community.  In line with its support of legal cannabis retail stores, CB5 supports the initiative announced by the District Attorney and Mayor to shut down New York's 1,400 unlicensed cannabis shops so that legitimate businesses within the District may flourish.  State Environmental Quality Review   The State Environmental Quality Review (SEQR) process is a legal requirement in New York State that mandates the consideration of environmental factors before certain actions are taken by state and local agencies and  is designed to assess and mitigate potential environmental impacts of proposed projects or actions.  CB5 believes that the SEQR process should be adapted to seek a more holistic assessment.  Specifically, CB5 would like to see a requirement for cumulative impact analysis. This analysis would assess the combined effects of multiple projects and activities in a defined area, rather than evaluating projects in isolation. This is extremely important in a dense urban area like CB5 where numerous projects can impact the environment collectively. As part of the holistic outlook, the SEQR formulation should also set clear environmental thresholds and standards for specific environmental parameters such as air quality, noise, water quality, sunshine protection and green space. It could consider the environmental effects of demolition versus adaptive reuse.  These standards can guide the evaluation of projects and ensure that projects contribute to rather than degrade environmental quality. Periodic comprehensive environmental reviews of specific areas within the city would allow for the ongoing evaluation of the environmental effects of multiple projects and serve to  strike a balance between protecting the environment and supporting responsible development.   Policy Specific Needs  The three  most pressing issues facing the district are : homelessness, economic recovery and development and quality of life issues.    Homelessness is rampant throughout CB5 and the City must approach the issue with a comprehensive and compassionate strategy that combines short-term assistance with long-term solutions to address the root causes of homelessness. CB5 calls upon the City to provide housing along with comprehensive support services such as job training, medical care, mental healthcare, and addiction treatment. While budgetary constraints are often offered as a reason for the lack of homeless services and housing, upfront investment in homeless housing and services is likely to result in better public health outcomes which in turn lessens the need for emergency services, including shelters and hospital services for the homeless.  Apart from the humanitarian necessity of providing such services, the presence of a large and visible homeless population negatively impacts tourism, the reputation of the District and how residents feel in their neighborhoods,which, in turn, affects businesses and jobs.  Addressing economic recovery in Midtown Manhattan is essential not only for the well-being of the local community but also for its role in the larger economic ecosystem, impacting the city, state, and nation. Strategies for recovery must involve targeted investments, incentives for businesses, tourism promotion, and support for the creative industries that New York City is known for.  As CB5 recovers economically it will enhance the overall quality of life for its residents and visitors by providing access to better services, more job opportunities, and a vibrant cultural scene.    Addressing quality of life issues within the District fosters a sense of community and social cohesion and creates a more welcoming and inclusive place for all. We would like to see investment in public safety measures, such well-lit streets and crime prevention programs to enhance security including anti-shoplifting mechanisms.  Quality of life also includes ensuring residents of all income levels can access suitable housing along with the development and maintenance of green spaces, the maintenance of our tree canopy and sightlines to iconic landmarks. Our District welcomes regulations and enforcement to mitigate excessive noise especially in residential areas.  We also wish to see improvements in cleanliness through effective waste management and sanitation services to create a more pleasant environment throughout the District .  And while we appreciate the availability of cycling and alternative modes of transportation, we need to ensure there is enforcement of our laws and that they are are followed by everyone which will make our streets safer for pedestrians, micro mobility riders and motorists.       Health Care & Human Services:  Services to reduce or prevent homelessness  Given the number of homeless individuals and families within CB5 as well as the large numbers experiencing housing insecurity, services to reduce or prevent homelessness are of primary concern to those in the District. Addressing mental health needs is a crucial aspect of homelessness prevention and assistance programs and we include that in our most important issue within this policy area.    Providing access to mental health services, supportive housing with integrated mental health care, and comprehensive support systems are essential to addressing the complex needs of individuals experiencing homelessness and mental illness and we would like to see robust funding for these programs.  We ask for additional funding for private emergency shelter accommodation as well as funding for the expansion of the City FEPS ( Family Eviction Prevention Supplement) program to help people transition to permanent housing with rent support. We have also requested funding for cost of living increases for those that are currently working in homeless community outreach. CB5 understands that one of the barriers to effective outreach is the inability to attract and retain staff and this funding will help to ensure the availability of trained homeless outreach workers.  We also have requested funding to expand the intensive mobile outreach teams who are critical in stabilizing those in supportive housing so that they do not become homeless.   CB5 recognizes that individuals facing eviction are much more likely to be evicted when they are not represented by a lawyer.  CB5 has requested that there be robust funding of the Right to Counsel program which will greatly aid those seeking to retain their homes.  Finally, as luxury developments continue to expand, there's also a concern about the potential displacement of long-term residents and the exacerbation of income inequality and we call on the City to ensure that luxury developments increase, rather than decrease, the availability of affordable units and that programs to ensure there is no displacement of long term residents be continued.  Youth Education and Child Welfare: Youth workforce and summer youth employment (SYEP)  CB5 continues to support funding SYEPs, which provide local youth with hands-on work experience while helping to instill leadership, innovation, problem solving, communication and time management. Research has found that well-designed SYEPs have positive impacts on academic and health outcomes, as well as soft skill development. These programs build the self-esteem and self-confidence of young people which in turn helps them to develop the ability to manage personal and social relationships as well as help address socioeconomic disparities by providing opportunities to those who might not have access.   Youth employment rates are very low relative to historical standards, triggering what has been called a &ldquo;youth employment crisis&rdquo;.  CB5 hopes that this program can be fully funded so that any youth that applies may be admitted to the program.   Public Safety and Emergency Services:  Crime Prevention programs  While noise complaints are consistently at the top of complaints registered at 311 for the CB5 community, crime prevention programs are of the utmost concern in this policy silo. The empty storefronts in the District attest to the need to nurture and protect retail establishments. We have seen these organizations face increased challenges related to theft and shoplifting and encourage programs that support the viability of our retail establishments.  As a primary destination for tourists as well as those who live and work here, it is important that we maintain a robust and lively streetscape in which retail establishments are often an integral part.  By investing in theft prevention programs, businesses contribute to the overall safety and well-being of the community and help foster a sense of security, making the community a more desirable place to live, work, and visit.  CB5 has also requested funding for vending enforcement which impacts our local retail.  Apart from crime prevention, the protection of local businesses are paramount as they contribute to a vibrant streetscape and contribute to the city in myriad ways. CB5 encourages the City to ensure that local businesses, especially those that were key to the District's pandemic recovery, be supported and not be undercut by other policies.  The recent shuttering of popular restaurants Marta and Maialino which occurred as the landmarked Redbury hotel transitioned to migrant housing was a blow not only to those who worked there but also to the District's economic recovery and street vibrancy.  Core Infrastructure, City Services and Resiliency: Cleanliness / trash collection  Trash and unsanitary conditions have been ongoing issues for the District and we hope that the problems will be alleviated given the new rules around commercial collections, the new rules regarding residential garbage, the new bin requirements and the increase of trash receptacles. We also hope that the new Rat Czar will have a major impact on the number of rats within the District.   We have asked for funding to ensure that the frequency of trash collections in and around the Grand Central area be increased.  In addition, we have requested funds to ensure the continued operation and success of the precision cleaning initiative as well as increased enforcement of dirty sidewalk/dirty areas and failure to clean area laws.   Although we have identified sanitation as our most important issue in this policy silo, CB5 also has grave concerns about the preparedness of the District for extreme weather events.  Rain earlier in the year overwhelmed the sewer system and flood water spilled into the subways causing major disruptions.  Accordingly, we have asked for additional funding to ensure there is a preparation and a plan to deal with extreme weather events including rainfall, flooding and extreme heat as the city's aging infrastructure, including its sewer system and transportation network, appear ill-equipped to handle the increased stress from extreme weather events.   Housing, Economic Development and Land Use:  Affordable Housing Creation  Addressing the need for affordable housing in Midtown Manhattan is an ongoing challenge, given the District's unique characteristics and the high demand for housing in this central location. However, it remains a critical goal to ensure that the area remains accessible to a broad range of residents, including those with varying income levels and background and CB5 has continually advocated for the retention of current units as well as the inclusion of affordable units in new developments. As always, CB5 requests funding for housing preservation programs, including funding for New York City's Department of  Housing Preservation and Development to expand the community land trust initiative to create and preserve permanent affordable housing.       New opportunities for affordable housing must be found, including senior housing, supportive housing, and housing for the formerly homeless, and existing affordable housing must be preserved in perpetuity as  current programs do not create affordable housing and in fact often exacerbate affordability.    Transportation and Mobility:  Traffic Safety and Enforcement  The enforcement of New York City Traffic Rules and Regulations is a complex task that includes education, licensing, infrastructure and enforcement and we support every measure taken to  ensure compliance with New York City Traffic Rules and Regulations.  Complaints in the District include bicycles, mopeds and motorcycle riders riding the wrong way in bike lanes and against traffic on the streets, failing to obey traffic rules and riding on the sidewalk.    Cyclists whether on bike, e-bike, scooter, moped or motorcycle cannot be immune to the local laws governing our public realm. CB5 encourages and requests increased funding for enforcement of local laws whether this is administered through DOT or the NYPD to ensure the safety of pedestrians, riders and drivers as we share the public realm. We also request permanent bike infrastructure on streets that do not have dedicated bike lanes.  Parks, Culture and Other Community Facilities: Quality of parks and park facilities  CB5 is perhaps unique in that most of its park space is not managed by the Parks Department.  Instead these parks are operated by private nonprofit organizations who are responsible for the day-to-day management, maintenance, and programming. These non-profits work in partnership with the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation to ensure the park's upkeep and the implementation of various activities and events.  CB5 is seeking additional green space including the creation and preservation of the tree canopy within the District.  The Board supports programs that plant trees, focus on maintenance efforts, and public awareness campaigns.  Trees play a vital role in managing stormwater runoff and help prevent flooding, decrease the strain on drainage infrastructure, and improve water quality by filtering pollutants before they enter water bodies. Moreover, access to green spaces has positive impacts on public health and well-being. Trees and greenery in the city have been linked to reduced stress levels, improved mental health, increased physical activity, and enhanced overall quality of life.

Additional well-known neighborhoods lie within our boundaries: Sutton Place, Beekman Place, Tudor City, Kips Bay, Rosehill, East Midtown Plaza, Waterside Plaza, Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village. The district is a mixture of residential, commercial, medical, educational and institutional uses with major office buildings, including 731 Lexington (""Bloomberg Tower""), 601 Lexington Avenue (former Citigroup Center), and the Chrysler building, and retail shops lining the avenues. There are several medical facilities used by all New Yorkers including VA Medical Center, Bellevue Hospital, NYU Langone Medical Center, NYU Langone Orthopedic Hospital, and Mt. Sinai Beth Israel Hospital. Numerous substance abuse, mental health, and ambulatory care clinics as well as some facilities of the New York Eye and Ear Hospital are located in the district. CD6 hosts the HRA 30th St Men's Shelter, the city's largest at 850 beds, Samaritan Village on 53rd, New Providence Women's Shelter and other homeless facilities, including a Safe Haven site on East 17th Street. The district includes the Baruch College campus, the School of Visual Arts, the NYU School of Medicine, the NYU College of Dentistry, and the Beren Campus of Yeshiva University, Stern College and other institutions. We host numerous bioscience laboratories out of the Alexandria Center for Life Science and expect more facilities as NYU continues expansion. CD6 is also home to the United Nations as well as hundreds of missions and diplomatic residences.  While recognizing the diversity of residential and commercial use, the district is primarily a middle-income community that has significant numbers of low-income residents and a large elderly population, many living on fixed incomes. We are always mindful that data about the neighborhoods of affluence in CD6 must not mask the very real need for access to affordable housing, homeless and general social services, and adequate measures for personal safety and overall well-being for all our neighbors. There are five Business Improvement Districts (BIDs) within CD6 or at its borders: The Grand Central Partnership, 34th Street Partnership, East Midtown Association, Union Square Partnership and the Flatiron/23rd Street Partnership. These continue to improve the quality of life within the district and we encourage the city to continue endorsing new BIDs where viable.  We also must draw attention to the two 197-a plans prepared by CB6 and adopted, with modifications, by the City Planning Commission and the City Council. In January 2008, the City Planning Commission approved with modifications the 197-a plan submitted by Manhattan Community Board 6. In March 2008 the City Council adopted the plan as modified by the City Planning Commission. In May of 1995, CB6 submitted a 197-a plan regarding Stuyvesant Cove. This plan was modified and adopted by the City Planning commission and City Council in 1997. These long-term planning documents should guide future action of all city agencies and are integral to the understanding of the needs of our district. This is particularly true in planning related to the waterfront and for the medical corridor that is anchored by First Avenue from 14th Street to 38th Street. CB6 is committed to seeing the planning guidelines and specific proposals of the 197-a plans fully implemented. CD6 is undergoing several major shifts in its urban planning landscape. Along the waterfront, the East Side Coastal Resiliency Project promises to transform access to additional open space and recreational opportunities, while increasing our district's ability to withstand flood damage like that experienced during Superstorm Sandy.  Recent rezoning efforts in East Midtown promise to transform several blocks in our district into more densely populated areas that could bring additional challenges to our docket. Mount Sinai Beth Israel's Campus transformation continues to pose questions, especially in the midst of a global pandemic. It is not clear how service closures will affect the community and working groups continue to meet to review the possible impacts of redevelopment of real estate at the site. Finally, affordability remains a difficult issue to solve and one which affects our middle- and working-class communities in direct, immediate ways. We will always look at any shifts in zoning (in-district or city-wide) and governmental- or institutionally-owned property as potential means to provide residents with housing units at reasonable cost based on their income levels.    ","","","","","Affordable Housing","","CD6 like many other community districts across the city is in dire need of affordable housing, particularly NEW low-income and moderate-income housing. Thanks to the passage of Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019, rent-stabilized housing remains the most effective measure of preserving existing affordable housing City-wide. We are grateful to the State legislature for passing comprehensive rent regulation reform which will preserve our district's stock of affordable rent stabilized housing. However, preserving our existing stock of affordable housing is not enough to ameliorate the housing crisis we face. Over the past 15-20 years, a loss of Mitchell-Lama, and loss of Section 8 housing, and loss of rent-controlled and loss of rent-regulated housing, have led to 13.7% of rental units being rented at 80% AMI, 20.6% of district renters are rent burdened, and 64.8% of low- income renters in the district are severely rent burdened. To support and retain population and economic diversity, the board seeks new or reclaimed low- and moderate-income housing within the district. ","Homelessness","","Despite the major residential development in Manhattan Community District 6 (CD6), affordable housing in our district is disappearing. At the same time, there has been little attention to the housing and support services needed by specific groups such as the disabled, seniors, and individuals facing homelessness. The City has opened both temporary and permanent housing for those experiencing homelessness but seldom provides the necessary support to transition individuals to permanent housing. Outreach to the chronically homeless is a long and difficult process and the basic humanitarian needs of the chronically homeless who turn to our parks and public spaces during the day are not being met. Funding for these critical support services should be increased not merely maintained. We include in basic humanitarian support, services that provide a measure of personal dignity such as restrooms and showers for those who currently have no way of accessing such services. ","Parks and open space","","CD6 has the least amount of open space of any community district in Manhattan. Census data shows our child-age population growing quickly, and therefore more playground and recreation space is needed. Residents of all ages keep our current spaces busy with active and passive uses and during the pandemic those green spaces provided a welcome relief to the necessary isolation and social distancing. Unfortunately, much of the open space we do have has fallen into disrepair and needs regular clean up and security patrols. Additionally, lack of open space is tied to air quality. Manhattan CD6 remains towards the top of several pollutant levels lists in recent municipal studies. As these levels are aggravated by lack of tree cover and extent of “impermeable surface,” additional green spaces can be considered a health matter. ","","","","","Services to reduce or prevent homelessness","","There have been state level commitments to build or rehabilitate 20,000 supportive housing units Statewide over the next fifteen years. While there has been some recent movement in a positive direction, at this time, CD6 has only one supportive housing facility, Kenmore Hall.  CB6 asks that additional supportive housing units be built in CD6—especially given CD6’s proximity to many public health facilities that support this population. Supportive housing will help our most vulnerable residents by creating a more robust social safety net to prevent a rise in street homelessness and to reduce crowding at our homeless shelters. CD6 has the largest men's homeless shelter in the country, the HRA 30th Street Men’s Shelter (located on 30th Street between 1st Avenue and the FDR Drive). This shelter maintains 850 beds and is the entry point for many citywide into the shelter system. Homelessness is a citywide issue; however, we are particularly concerned that the lack of supportive housing units in CD6 has led to an increase in street-homeless. We need to put greater focus on health care, mental health care, and other social services. CB6 asks that the City and State ensure that supportive housing providers be fully funded so that they can continue to plan, build, and operate supportive housing and the associated social services. The City continues to invest in costly temporary solutions while underinvesting in long-term systemic solutions, The structural shortage of affordable housing, the undersupply of supportive housing and social support services, and the urgent relocations for health and safety reasons forced by the covid emergency – taken together these things have made it clearer than ever that we as a community are not adequately serving unhoused New Yorkers and that we are not delivering on our social commitment to enable all our citizens to live in safety, security and dignity.","There are several major hospitals in CD6, used by all New Yorkers, including Mount Sinai Beth Israel (MSBI) Medical Center, VA Medical Center, Bellevue Hospital, NYU Langone Medical Center, and the NYU Langone Orthopedic Hospital.  Numerous substance abuse, mental health, and other ambulatory care clinics as well as some facilities of the New York Eye and Ear Hospital are located in CD6. These together essentially comprise a ""medical corridor"" within New York City, as alluded to in our 197-a Plan. We look forward to continued cooperation with these medical facilities as they expand and modernize their operations, as well as cooperation with city agencies in ensuring that these institutions have the adequate, surrounding infrastructure and supportive programming needed to properly serve both district residents and New Yorkers at large.  Mount Sinai had initially planned to sell two of their properties on its Beth Israel campus-1 and 10 Nathan Perlman Place. If the sale happened, the community would've had less access to the wide variety of care provided at these two properties, ranging from substance abuse services to treatment for heart disease. Additionally, our community had serious concerns that the campus would be purchased by a developer and turned into more luxury housing, rather than the quality affordable housing and community facilities that our district needs.   In June 2021, Mount Sinai Beth announced its decision to reconsider their plans and remain in our district. However, MSBI says that they still plan to sell a portion of their current properties, including the Bernstein Pavilion. CB6 will continue monitoring the issue and advocating to give the community a voice in the future planning and development of any MSBI campus buildings that the hospital decides to sell.  For decades, CB6 has been advocating for a strategic plan to determine Bellevue Hospital's immediate and future health care and land use needs, especially prior to any potential disposition of property. No such study has ever been conveyed to the board. We will continue to advocate for updated facilities, State-of-the-art equipment, and improved services there. We assume we will see significant changes to reflect what was learned by the response to the Covid-19 pandemic and its impact on the physical plant, medical supply chains and so much more including, most importantly, ensuring the well-being of patients and first line medical professionals. We applaud the City's response through its public hospital system and will support what they identify as emerging needs in any way we can.  CB6 has taken note of the lack of high-quality skilled nursing facilities in Manhattan and especially within CD6. Also, the number of hospice beds is woefully inadequate. The NYC Department of City Planning projects that Manhattan's elderly population, aged 65 and over, will grow by 57.9% between 2000 and 2030, adding 108,000 elderly persons. CD6 has seen an increase in the number of persons aged 65 and over of 9.8% just since the 2000 census - and more than 45% of these individuals are 75 and older. We therefore must plan for the additional health and other support services needed by this population. Consistent with the 197-a Plan, we are looking at development of health-related facilities within this ""medical corridor."" Among other options, we would welcome a sub-acute facility or multiple use facility that would allow for a continuum of care for seniors and others. Biotech incubators, such as the Alexandria Center for Life Sciences, are also well-received additions to the corridor's development. Non-medical and non-research related uses within this corridor will be subject to the greatest scrutiny and likely continued opposition. ","In CD6, over 18% of our population is 65 and older, one of the highest proportions of seniors relative to other community districts. Therefore, senior services are of paramount importance to our district, especially since seniors are more likely to have income restraints. To encourage innovative programming, we urge the city to provide funding that looks beyond just the number of meals served and focuses instead on the services seniors seek for social and mental stimulation. We recognize older adults prioritize the ability to maintain and create new relationships. Social isolation is a major concern when considering aging segments, whether due to living alone or to disabilities.  Research suggests that isolation may be as harmful as smoking, obesity and lack of physical activity. Social isolation also contributes to elder abuse and preventable deaths. And yet, our experience with the pandemic tells us that congregate situations with the elderly may pose added health risks. We look forward to working with DFTA in finding creative solutions that can provide social distancing when needed but social interaction to the extent possible.  The board also notes that falls are a serious health issue among seniors in CD6. Therefore, programming to foster social and physical activity would help prevent avoidable injury and illness in many of our seniors. We are pleased by DFTA's efforts to introduce ""innovative senior centers"" and while the social distancing required in 2020-2021 has been a challenge to senior centers of all types, the innovative centers are still a step in the right direction. Unfortunately, no innovative senior center is located in CD6. We ask that DFTA look at expanding programs for our seniors beyond the confines of the traditional senior center, making them available throughout our district. We were pleased to see funds allocated in the FY 2022 budget for as many as 25 new senior centers located throughout the City.   We note that we only have two senior centers, one at the northern- and one at the southern-most end of the map, and they are at capacity. To fill the need for residents in the middle of our district, a new center would be a welcome addition and one for which we have advocated for more than a decade.  However, recognizing that a dedicated single-site senior center may be financially challenging even with the expressed budget allocation, and recognizing that it may take some time to find and outfit a suitable location, we propose shared space with existing educational facilities such as libraries, colleges or underutilized city-owned spaces, or through partnerships with area community-based organizations. Facilities and organizations should have the funds to provide services not just for the frail, but also for active seniors. Computer labs with Internet access provide a wide range of opportunities so all seniors may research issues related to their health, keep informed of programs for their age group, and expand their skill set. Education on how to manage benefits online should lead to improved quality of life as well as greater use of federal programs and less reliance on city funds. CB6 consistently advocates for lifelong learning in budget requests to provide on-going education for seniors. In addition to meals and programming, aging-in-place services are vital, like homecare (a cheaper option than nursing homes) and escort assistance. Respite assistance for caregivers also is needed and ultimately, is a cost-cutting measure. Further, affordable housing options should keep this segment in mind - seniors should be able to remain in their neighborhoods of choice. Specialized legal needs and support for the physically and financially abused elderly have recently arisen as pressing concerns. We understand federal funding has been cut over the years, but various studies suggest an aging population and services supporting it remain vital - these requests are shared by community districts  across New York City. The city must take steps to make up the funding gap since we can no longer rely on other government sources. CB6 has consistently advocated for greater funding for senior services but it never materializes. This year, we hope the promised  budgetary support will help our City be a leader in facilities and programming for healthy and secure senior years. ","CB6 faces certain unique  housing related challenges based in large part to the close proximity of five facilities/features within a several block radius of one another - NYCHA's Nathan Straus Houses (located at 2nd Avenue between 27th and 28th Street), the HRA 30th Street Men's Shelter (located on 1st Avenue and 30th Street), ACS's Nicholas Scoppetta Children's Center (located on 1st Avenue between 26th and 27th Streets), Bellevue South Park (located between 1st and 2nd Avenues and 26th and 28th Streets), and the single largest concentration of hospitals in the city, including NYCHH's Bellevue Hospital and the VA Medical Center (all located along 1st Avenue between 23rd Street and 34th Streets) creating the largest Public Health District in the city.  The result has been a concentration of three separate constituencies: people experiencing homelessness, local residents and ACS teens, all within a few blocks of one another. Each of these groups are competing for extremely limited places to go, particularly during the day, and thereby creating a variety of challenges and pressures on this area of the district. It is no surprise then, that CB6 experiences homeless conditions and housing challenges that are complicated and high in volume and require sophisticated and thoughtful solutions. ","CD6 welcomes programming that seeks to help individuals find employment opportunities, particularly when a job can allow them to exit public assistance. It is estimated that over 5% of our district receives some form of government-funded income support; many of these residents do not have the skills to gain employment in a competitive, changing marketplace. Free or affordable job training programs and employment-readying services are essential to this mission. We acknowledge the city's progress in integrating social services to make it easier for individuals and families to reach the proper agencies and programs when they need help. AccessNYC, the city's benefits portal, allows them to more easily attain those benefits, including food assistance, rent support and supplemental health insurance, which stabilize their current hardships. Further outreach is needed to make sure CD6 residents are aware of this website. Despite recent federal cuts, we must make sure citizens know they might have food, housing and medical security in these still-difficult economic times. As CD6 continues to see luxury residential development replace low- and middle-income housing, HRA's oversight of legal services becomes an indispensable part of the affordable housing arsenal, as fixed-income constituents, including seniors, face landlord harassment and complicated visits to Housing Court. We welcome the city's major investment in legal aid for these and other purposes that assist people in staying in their current home, thereby solidifying our neighborhoods. Increased funding for these programs should be maintained in FY 2024 and beyond to avoid displacing neighbors and prevent homelessness. ","","","","","School and educational facilities (Maintenance)","","Schools in CD6 need continued investment in their aging infrastructure. HVAC issues, electrical and plumbing lines, and fiber optic cabling are just some of the areas in need of attention. We should also point out that while the welfare of students is the primary focus of any school maintenance, adult staff facilities should be kept in mind when renovations are identified and planned. Retrofitting our schools based on the COVID-19 experience has begun and has already allowed for a resumption of in-person classroom instruction, but there may be a long and expensive period ahead.","Universal Pre-K seats and insufficient afterschool and support services for children continue to be a problem in CD6. The board's ability to address the state of our schools is hampered by the lack of adequate communication about proposed educational plans, facility enhancements, and resource allocation. Although PS 281 opened in 2013, issues have already arisen, including child safety concerns due to changing traffic patterns and construction on adjacent sites, as well as the concerns about the anticipated lack of sunlight in the schoolyard and some disruption as a result of renovations to St. Vartan Park. CB6 restates its belief that communication between boards and the DOE and School Construction Authority would improve outcomes. To keep our schools up to date, they need appropriate technology upgrades and wiring to support the bandwidth of tomorrow. Some schools in CD6 have upgraded infrastructure, but many facilities remain unaddressed, including facilities used by adult staff and parents, which are often overlooked. Refurbished facilities would also be available for community events providing year-round, multi-purpose utilization of school buildings. Our schools should also be constantly monitored for air quality to protect our children from exposure to toxic substances. Overall, CD6, located in School District 2, should see a greater rate of spending per child, since IBO reports we have among the lowest per-pupil allocations in the city. CB6 continues to urge that the old Police Academy location on East 20th St should be considered a possible location for a school once the NYPD vacates. It is our current understanding that the agency does not have immediate plans to leave, but we urge the administration to include the board and surrounding community in any future planning for this site as required by the New York City Charter. CB6 has a Stated position that any future private charter schools not be placed in current public-school facilities as this undermines their efficacy. In addition, CB6 supports the establishment and continuation of stand-alone capital fund accounts formed when we experience large-scale residential or commercial development. Financial contributions by private developers and institutions in these instances would help address increased collateral needs resulting from such projects that add permanent or commuter populations to our district. These needs can include new schools, transit services and below-surface infrastructure. ","CB6 appreciates the difficulty and quantity of the caseload covering children's issues in New York. We support efforts that establish an effective and appropriate caseworker-per-child ratio. Abuse and even fatalities of children that were being monitored by ACS demonstrate that more well-qualified caseworkers are needed to ensure the safety of our kids. Proper management of these cases can help prevent other tragedies, but in some cases, can help prevent the alternative - foster care - by providing households with counseling and services that allow the family to stay intact. Kinship programs, where relatives care for the child in lieu of strangers, should be promoted where possible, and support for those caregivers must be adequately distributed. Our board also encourages lead agencies to promote foster parenting to citizens within our borders in cooperation with the CD6 office. We are pleased that a Community Advisory Board (CAB) has been established for the Nicholas Scoppetta Children's Center (ACS) on First Avenue and that it meets regularly. ACS' location within what we have referred to in previous sections as a ""public health district"" has led to needs specific to this area. For more on those needs, see the sections on homelessness and public security. Additionally, CB6 recognizes the important role ACS plays in early childhood education and welcomes new hires to manage programs and providers of such services. It is essential that, coupled with Universal Pre-K, EarlyLearn and other initiatives seek funding to achieve maximum enrollment in CD6 and beyond.  ","","","","","Other - Write In (Required)","","As previously mentioned, CD6's ""public health district,"" the several block radius that encompasses NYCHA’s Nathan Straus Houses (located at 2nd Avenue between 27th and 28th Street), the 30th Street Men’s Shelter (located on 1st Avenue and 30th Street), ACS’s Nicholas Scoppetta Children’s Center (located on 1st Avenue between 26th and 27th Streets), Bellevue South Park (located between 1st and 2nd Avenues and 26th and 28th Streets), and the single largest concentration of hospitals in the city, including NYCHH’s Bellevue Hospital and the VA Medical Center (all located along 1st Avenue between 23rd Street and 34th Streets, has resulted in a concentration of three separate constituencies (homeless, local residents and ACS teens), all within a few blocks of one another, each competing for extremely limited places to go, particularly during the day, and thereby creating a variety of challenges and pressures on this area of the district.","While our crime rates remain stable (or lower in some categories), issues associated with some of our homeless shelters and several clinics have particularly concerned CD6 residents. Other issues include increasing calls about urinating and defecating in public and, while off somewhat from previous years, public drinking and drug use, loitering in playgrounds, extensive littering, and aggressive panhandling. Through Community Advisory Boards (CABs), we continue to communicate with NYPD, lead agencies and the service sites to find solutions to these problems, including more frequent foot patrols of surrounding streets. As traffic worsens in CD6, so do infractions: Speeding, disobeying traffic signals, blocking of intersections, parking in bus and bike lanes, and illegal stopping. This adds to potential dangers to our pedestrian-heavy district.   Moreover, continued increases in bicycle ridership and other micro-mobility options adds a new element to policing of traffic safety. To be clear, CB6 does not intend to put the onus on cyclists, but rather suggests the comprehensive monitoring of how they, cars and pedestrians interact safely and follow traffic rules. We would welcome officers or auxiliary personnel on bike patrol to add units that mimic the new transportation landscape. We further suggest that, as an ongoing City Hall priority, Vision Zero helps place emphasis on integrating the many new and old facets of transportation to ensure everyone commutes safely.   Noise remains the top complaint as registered by 311. While complaints were down in the period when bars and restaurants closed or limited access as a result of pandemic restrictions, they picked up considerably. There have been many concerns voiced by the community about the concentration of bars along 2nd and 3rd Avenues, particularly in the East 20s, 30s and 50s. These areas are heavily congested and noisy when patrons congregate outside or leave the venue. Some owners blast music out of open storefronts. Advertised pub crawls exacerbate the issue. Residents have found calls to 311 frustrating as law enforcement has many hours to respond to non-emergency; therefore, there is limited response to these issues when they are actually happening. This is also true for complaints of excessive honking when vehicular traffic is backed up and sirens which seem to be overused in non-emergency situations. NYPD should coordinate activities with DEP to provide better response times to address these ongoing violations. DEP should also explore outreach efforts to the community where they could educate the public on how to best monitor and document noise problems to assist the agency in investigations. Of course, our police precincts cannot carry out their duties effectively with aging infrastructure hampering their efforts. We have asked for full modernization of precincts in CD6 that reflect the force's 21st Century needs. We have been told that there are no needs currently, but we are open to supporting future requests for funding. ","CD6 hosts first-class emergency rooms and hospital facilities within its borders. Our first responders should have state-of-the-art bases and training, ready for more of the potential crises we have experienced in the recent past. Both our community and its emergency responders, including firefighters, EMS workers and other emergency support workers, are better served when responders are equipped with the right tools. With regards to EMS Battalion 8, a concern is construction and renovation of sites adjacent to their facility. With a major development project on the horizon at the former Brookdale Campus on East 25th St and the upcoming resiliency-related upgrades at Bellevue Hospital Center, CB6 is concerned Battalion 8 will be hampered or may have to be temporarily relocated. We will watch the progress at these sites so that they do not adversely affect this essential deliverer of emergency services. ","","","","","Noise pollution","","With major arteries and approaches, such as to the Queens Midtown Tunnel and the 59th St Bridge, and due to increased bike/bus lanes and private and public street closures, traffic has become a major problem and results in increased noise. Additionally, high-rise building construction is rampant and causes its own noise pollution. With several bar and nightlife stretches, we also experience noise complaints due to evening activities. Noise is the number one CD6 resident complaint to 311.","CB6 continues to advocate for measures that better the overall environmental quality of the district, including resolutions on greater efficiency for city vehicles and boats, monitoring of construction projects and ""macro"" items, such as advocacy for greater recycling efforts. However, we also look for support in day-to-day monitoring of air and noise pollution. With increased traffic congestion due to several factors, street noise and concerns about air quality have increased. As the attached Air Survey maps show, NO2 levels, heavily weighted towards traffic levels, remain at their highest in Manhattan CD6. Other contributing factors to air and noise pollution: The 34th Street Heliport's noise, odors and air blast impacts have drawn criticism from nearby residents and just a few years ago necessitated replacement of costly air filtration equipment at NYU Langone Medical Center. Residential and commercial real estate development in the district raises many of the same noise and air concerns. Additionally, our prominent nightlife districts result in frequent calls from residents to 311, complaining about loud patrons and blaring music from open storefronts into the early morning hours. A greater number of inspectors to monitor noise is needed as well as schedules which deploy inspectors at the time of the active complaint rather than the next day or later.  We also ask that more air monitoring devices be placed in areas of recently increased construction and traffic activity so that their short- and medium-term impact can be analyzed. CB6 also believes better coordination on hot button issues between DEP and these other agencies could prove fruitful (NYPD in the case of traffic and nightlife; DOT with regards to conducting traffic studies and observing emission levels; DOB when it comes to onsite construction inspections and asbestos abatement). As we have suggested elsewhere, DEP should also educate the public in how to best monitor and document on-going noise issues to assist the agency's enforcement measures. ","Trash complaints to the CD6 office, both residential and on our streets, have increased. We continue to note that additional enforcement of alternate side of the street regulations is needed to facilitate regular maintenance. Some sidewalks also fare poorly, as they are continuously littered. CB6 supports hiring of additional crews to remedy the situation, and encourages  further review of pick-up routes and frequency. Commercial and residential garbage frequently sits on the street for many hours in advance of mandated curbside placement times, which creates odors and unsightly messes that also attract rodents. This issue pertains to both privately- and government-owned buildings. Enforcement of sanitation rules must be increased. Additional pickups seem warranted to handle the increase in mandated recycling efforts. Small- and medium-sized buildings do not have space to store the added volume between once-weekly pickup times. Anecdotal evidence suggests many buildings are commingling their recycling with regular garbage on sanitation pick-up days to free up space in receptacles and refuse rooms. It's time to treat recycling collection and enforcement the same as that for regular trash.   Graffiti became a serious problem in the last two years  throughout the district with new examples along Third Avenue and on side streets in Murray Hill. Graffiti degrades the district making the district less attractive for small business and less pleasant as a residential area. We support the restoration of New York City's graffiti removal program and applaud the efforts of neighborhood associations and police precincts to address the most egregious examples.  Finally, DSNY with EDC has proposed that a garage be located at the former Hunter College Brookdale Campus, 425 East 25th St, between First Ave and FDR Dr. While CB6 recognizes the principle of locating such facilities in or near the district being served, we have objected to the placement of this project in the middle of the medical corridor (between Bellevue Center and the VA Hospital) and near major residential developments and schools. The location is in clear opposition to our 197-a plan. A planning study commissioned by CB6 proposed two alternatives that have gone ignored (see ""25th Street Sanitation Garage"" study below). We still have no specifics as to plans for the remainder of the site on either end of the planned garage, even after several scoping hearings with community groups, but the ULURP process remains. CB6 has serious concerns in regard to a sanitation garage being proposed at this site. In the meantime, DSNY has established a temporary base of operations on East 26th Street along with a nearby on-street site for the storage of sanitation vehicles on Mount Carmel Place, next to residences and a park. The board was given no other options on this siting. We oppose this location and encourage the City  to take any possible measures to relocate the temporary base & vehicle parking to a non-residential area where it would be more appropriate.  ","","","","","Affordable housing creation","","Affordable housing is disappearing from CD6 and demand continues to increase. Thanks to the passage of the Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019, rent-stabilized housing remains the most effective measure of preserving existing affordable housing City-wide. CB6 requests the development of NEW low-income and moderate-income housing in CD6. Over the past 15-20 years, a loss of Mitchell Lama, and loss of Section 8 housing, and loss of rent-controlled and loss of rent-regulated housing, have led to 13.7% of rental units being rented at 80% AMI, 20.6% of district renters are rent burdened, and 64.8% of low- income renters in the district are severely rent burdened. In order to support and retain our existing population and promote economic diversity, we call upon the City to provide new or reclaimed low-and moderate-income housing within our district in the forthcoming year.","Before the 2008 recession, CD6 saw rapid building growth, with over 2000 additional residential units constructed since the 2000 Census, plus over 2 million square feet of new office and retail space. By 2016, a boom in residential permitting had returned, with building applications at record highs. DOB and related agencies need enough tools and personnel to process paperwork and inspect sites correctly. Rapid growth also means additional infrastructure requirements, such as transit options, subsurface service delivery, sanitation services, and open space - City Planning staff should be sufficient to meet these challenges. Greater East Midtown rezoning was approved in August 2017, after extensive community comment and input. Responding to community requests for additional open space, the text amendment requires each site developed under the rezoning to provide public open space. CB6 wants to encourage the creation of open space in the district. and will work with the city and private developers to facilitate open space development, as well as street level public realm improvements.   CB6 remains an advocate for expanded transportation and subsurface infrastructure and specific public realm upgrades. We hope to work with DCP and partners to preserve East Midtown's global competitiveness in the 21st Century, while retaining some human scale and meeting demands of local residents. This applies not just to multi-block rezoning, but also to the rising number of individual sites slated for ""superscrapers,"" which CB6 opposes when they threaten the scale and character of a neighborhood. As to remapping streets, 30th St east of First Ave does not appear on the official city map, thus is technically not a street. In our 2008 City Council-approved 197-a plan, CB6 Stated its desire to re-map this street. Another re-mapping request is 26th St east of First, at the site of the proposed DSNY Garage. The Sanitation Garage Working Group requested that DSNY re-map the street as it enhances oversight of adjoining parcels. Any further changes on the horizon to street mapping proposed by government or institutional actors, due to issues such as waterfront resiliency or otherwise, will continue to receive our board's highest scrutiny. Regarding the DSNY garage, the proposed rezoning would change the property from an R to M zone, which would constitute spot zoning. The property is located between Bellevue and the VA, an area designated as a medical corridor in CD6's 197-a plan. The community at-large asks that the ULURP process take objections into account. Due to local opposition and since it contradicts our 197-a, CB6 requests DSNY re-evaluate alternatives sites.Finally, CB6 is in the process of updating our database of privately-owned public spaces (POPS) in CD6. This database will include the site's physical condition, amenities required, and general notes. As soon as this database is completed it will be posted publicly on our website, cbsix.org. We ask for additional oversight of our POPS and for City Planning to partner with community boards on developing a better POPS framework, especially since CD6 ranks lowest in amount of open space in Manhattan.  ","CD6 is confronting a housing crisis along with the rest of the city. We have not seen significant upticks in preservation or new affordable development under the current Housing New York plan. In order to support and retain our existing residents and promote economic diversity, CB6 calls on the city to commit funds to provide new or reclaimed low- and moderate-income housing within the district, with particular attention to senior citizens and other fixed-income households. Our community has demonstrated great compassion for those experiencing  homelessness and is aware of the enormous demands for service needed by this population. CD6 welcomed new developments within the district built or converted under the successful city-and-State joint program NY/NY III, which created 9000 supportive housing units for the mentally ill homeless and other target segments. We believe it is essential that successor programs learn from the positive lessons in interagency communication and community involvement in site selection (led in the city by DOHMH and HPD). We were encouraged by city and State commitments to the construction of new supportive units and hope to see those commitments actually result in housing units. We ask that already allocated funding be disbursed immediately so they can begin to sensibly address our persistent homelessness crisis. The case for this type of housing can be made financially, as shown in the attached report, which shows it saves taxpayers when compared to sheltering or institutionalization - $40 per person per day in supportive housing vs. a staggering $802 per day in the latter options.   CD6 supports additional housing for families experiencing homelessness and notes that new supportive housing units were identified in spring and summer 2021. We also would like to draw attention to our district's NYCHA developments. CB6 is aware that capital needs are an agency-wide problem, but Straus Houses requires upgrades that deal with immediate security concerns. Residents and management have alerted us to items such as new lobby doors that would prevent non-residents from entering the premises without permission. On an operations level, these developments need new refuse disposal facilities and policies, where curbside placement frequently occurs on the wrong days and times, leading to accumulation of garbage and attracting vermin and persons looking to rummage through. Recycling efforts should also be redoubled, and pest control should be further explored. We want to make sure CD6 NYCHA residents' needs are communicated through our office, which is why we also encourage the agency to expand and share informational resources so we can achieve this effectively.  ","We are pleased that sources of highly skilled medical and research jobs and the economic stimulus they provide are in and near CD6. NYU Langone recently completed a 14-story laboratory building on East 30th St and First Ave and a new Children's Hospital at East 34th Street and First Ave. The Alexandria Center of Life Science, part of East River Science Park, has two operational buildings with a third on the way. It is devoted primarily to biotech facilities and contains 300,000 sq. ft. of lab and other R&D space. Funding for this project was a public/private arrangement including money from city and State entities, the city's business community, some federal funding, and the developer. We welcome the addition of the Cornell NYC Tech Campus on Roosevelt Island which, while located outside CD6, will have great impact. CB6 has advocated for a strategic plan to determine Bellevue's health care and land use needs prior to disposition of property. No such study has been conveyed to us.   CB6 remains diligent about our waterfront. We continue to work toward a continuous esplanade and bikeway along the East River. The former Con Ed site pier, renamed Waterside Pier, has been restored and has received preliminary amenities, though much remains to be done. The esplanade between East 53rd and East 61st Streets that was included in the FY 2022 budget is under construction and will have a dramatic impact on our waterfront access and use.  We look forward to incorporating the existing parking lots along the waterfront into public spaces, that can be used by the entire community, including the NYU parking at East 34th St and parking areas under the FDR Drive. Our continuing participation in and expansion of the East Side Coastal Resiliency plan remains essential. Continued incorporation of the East River Blueway Plan items into these resiliency projects are positive steps that we continue to support. We also are happy that the NYC Ferry stop at East 20th Street and East 34th  are active and serving the residents of CD6. ","","","","","Accessibility (ADA related compliance and infrastructure enhancements)","","Of the six subway stations that have subway entrances in Community District 6, two (59th & Lexington Ave and 14th & 3rd Ave) remain ADA non-compliant. The heavily used 59th & Lexington Ave station was slated for accessibility improvements in the 2020-2024 Capital Plan. However, any such plans are on hold indefinitely for lack of funds in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic. We hope that funds will become available sooner than expected and that the critical accessibility upgrades can be back on schedule. The City should provide funding to the MTA to make all subway stations in and near our district accessible by constructing elevators and accessible entrances to subway platforms.","Traffic in CD6 is a major concern. We need a traffic study and action plan to understand how vehicular flow can improve. With major vehicular transit points like the 59th St Bridge, Queens Midtown Tunnel and FDR, plus sometimes all-day avenue and side street congestion, solutions need to be identified to allow better movement for private cars, buses, bikes and pedestrians alike. Major construction at the Queens Midtown Tunnel has abated but the problem of traffic backups and noise continue on major streets, side streets, and avenues that feed this vital artery. Work on the MTA's Park Avenue infrastructure may make matters on those same side streets worse. Traffic congestion  increases with  partial and full street closures by real estate development and construction, and is further complicated by  DOT or utility company street work. We need studies of the  traffic patterns as well as  better coordination of work/permitting to aid in addressing the obstacles in relieving congestion.   And with the implementation of congestion pricing, it is now a good time to conduct such studies to address the impact it will have on our neighborhood. CB6 had high hopes for Vision Zero. We were pleased with the initial efforts being made to install accessible crossing signals and curb cuts and continue to request them at problem-corners via DOT's portal. Traffic incidents occur throughout the district, but some locations are of greater concern. The area around 34th St and FDR Dr Service Rd consistently ranks high in collision rates. Engineering to address traffic flow there  is essential. CB6 has also heard from residents about 23rd St and 2nd Ave, 23rd St and 3rd Ave, and the ever- problematic 57th to 58th Street section of 2nd Ave. To help address pedestrian-vehicle collisions, several measures can be studied. Dedicated left turn signals are necessary at several major intersections along our avenues.   Additionally, CB6 asks that DOT consider traffic calming measures, such as leading pedestrian intervals, speed bumps, all-red stop phases or other methods to improve safety for pedestrians along some avenue segments. Pedestrian-bicycle incidents are on the rise. There has been a noticeable increase in bike ridership. CB6 supports protected bike lanes, but infractions such as sidewalk riding, ignoring stop lights, and traveling against traffic are dangerous to not only pedestrians, but to cyclists and vehicular traffic as well. Simple enforcement of existing laws and regulations  is the obvious first level  solution. Micro-mobility users not only deal with lanes shared by buses, vehicles, and double parking, but they have challenges with major gaps in the East River Greenway, which force cyclists into dangerous traffic conditions. Completion of protected bike lanes along the east side of CD6 is a critical component of DOT strategy. As for waterways, CB6 is happy that there is now an East River Ferry stop at East 20th Street. We look forward to the continued use of this maritime complement to our current, congested land-based transportation network. We note, however, that as ferry-related pedestrian and bicycle traffic increases along the FDR Service Road, so should monitoring of possible safety issues related to vehicular traffic flow.  ","CB6 notes its continuing support for a full-length Second Avenue Subway which would relieve the burden on the Lexington Line and provide much-needed relief to the congested bus system along First, Second and Third Avenues. Many on the East Side currently walk over one-half mile to a subway station. Phases 3 and 4 of the project are expected to benefit Manhattan CD6. We eagerly await the completion of this work and ask the city to block any efforts to further delay it. Consideration of simultaneous work on Phases 2-4 should be considered as funding and machinery is available. In light of capital demands on the Metropolitan Transit Authority, we hope the city and the State will cooperate in funding shortfalls in the MTA's capital budget, with particular attention to the Second Avenue Subway line's completion. The economic benefits are apparent: it would secure New York its place as a competitive, world-class business environment, while its construction provides good-paying jobs for New Yorkers. A proposed Emergency Ventilation Plant (EVP) for the Lexington Avenue Subway Line was slated for the area under Park Avenue in the East 30s. As the MTA has delayed this action item pending review of possible alternatives to the original plan, we await a resolution that is considerate of the community in this project-intensive neighborhood. For this and any other project in the neighborhood we expect efforts to limit noise, potential street closures, pedestrian detours, and general traffic flow disruptions.   The Board is pleased that requests to make the First Av L Train subway station ADA compliant have resulted in the construction of platform elevators at that station, and hopes that, along with vital upgrades to the line, the MTA will consider making additional L train stops compliant with ADA regulations Additionally, CB6 hopes more bus lane improvements such as transit priority signals and bus lane cameras will increase efficiencies of bus lanes along First and Second Avenues to decrease clustering and improve travel times. Finally, we want to ensure the MTA and NYCTA remain vigilant in its oversight of maintenance at stations managed and constructed by private developers. The long-term upkeep of these stations requires continued supervision and their completion should be monitored for unreasonable delays.  ","","","","","Quality of parks and park facilities","","CB6 selects parks as an important capital priority because of limited open space in our district. In a borough-wide comparison, CD6 has the least amount of open space and outdoor recreation. CD6 is also one of the densest districts in New York City, with 146.8k residents and only 18 acres of park space. Compared to other districts, the ratio of parks to people is disproportionate, ranking open space as one of CB6’s top capital and expense objectives. CB6 advocates for additional open space and improved park facilities that provide not just rest and recreational opportunities but also  visual relief in the district’s densely developed areas.","Increase in CD6's Youth Population   In CD6, 8.7 percent of the residents are under the age of eighteen and this number is growing. Between the years of 2020 and 2030, the Department of City Planning (DCP) projects an 8.9 percent increase in children between the ages of 5 and 17. CB6's  request for additional active open space and playgrounds addresses our current needs and anticipates the growth in the school age demographic in our district.     CD6's Privately Owned Public Spaces   CD6's limited park spaces are  found primarily between 2nd Avenue to the East River.  When compared to other districts, CD6  lacks adequate access to open space and active recreation space.   In the area from Lexington to 2nd Avenue, there is a number of  privately owned public spaces (POPS) suitable for passive uses. Preservation of our 77 POPS is  vital as a mitigation for  the  low amount of park space and are particularly important  in our densely populated neighborhoods. We ask for the city's support in ensuring that the POPS  are compliant and accessible. In 2008, CB6 began surveying the district's POPS and is currently  updating the survey with new observations. CB6 recommends that POPS not be quantified as parkland, to ensure that there is an accurate count of acreage attributed to active recreation and to  open space for passive uses.  CB6  advocates for both types.  Each contributes to the enjoyment  of both residents and visitors to our District.      CD6's Flood Zone   Thirteen of CD6's parks are in the 2050 floodplain: Sutton Place Park South, Peter Detmold, Robert Moses Playground, St. Vartan Park, Glick Park, Asser Levy Park, Peter's Field, Augustus St. Gaudens Playground, Stuyvesant Square Park, Con Edison Field, Captain Patrick J. Brown Walk, Stuy Cove (EDC), and Waterside Pier (EDC). During the East Side Coastal Resiliency (ESCR) Project, Murphy Brothers Playground, Stuyvesant Cove Park, Asser Levy Playground and Captain Patrick J. Brown Walk will be remodeled and upgraded to include improved programming, landscapes, recreational fields, playgrounds, and/or amenities. It is estimated that these parks will be closed for 3.5 to 5 years. As part of the ESCR project, a flood barrier will be deployed to prevent flood inundation, still, CB6 advocates for supplemental action. The interior of the Asser Levy Recreation Center requires infrastructural upgrades for functional improvement and to deter storm damage. In the event of a flood, additional capital upgrades that flood proof the recreation center could have monetary benefits. CB6 recommends that the Department of Parks & Recreation (DPR) conduct a cost benefit analysis on flood-proofing parks that are in the floodplain. CB6 advocates for resilient materials in parks, floodproofing, and waterfront zoning for buildings on our waterfront.   New Park for CD6   Along with the ESCR project, CB6 advocates for additional park development in CD6, particularly on our waterfront. In many stretches of CD6, residents cannot access their waterfront. This is because the FDR obstructs the greenway. Many segments 'Under the Elevated' FDR highway are dark, unsafe, and unfit for community activity. These segments on the waterfront can be repurposed not just for enjoyment of the residents but to act as further mitigation for the ESCR project. One such space is the 34th Street parking lot, which obstructs pedestrian views, impacts pedestrian and bike safety, and connectivity. Waterfront open space has a proven track record of turning desolate spaces into networks of community exchange that foster economic growth; thus, a waterfront park has the potential to be a resource for CD6 residents.   Tree Planting & Bioswales for CD6   CB6 thanks DPR for their mitigation efforts through targeted tree planting and urban forest enhancements, which proposes 1,000 tree plantings in parks and streets, and 40 bioswales starting in fall of 2019. CB6 welcomes collaboration between the DPR and City Council Members to create these capital improvements. CB6 recommends that Partnerships For Parks expand its programming and gardening services throughout CD6.   Irrigation Systems for CD6's Parks   Irrigation in parks is used for water fountains, sprinkler systems, and tree watering. DPR says that watering your street tree or greenstreet is very important and is an extreme challenge for parks workers and residents. If more parks had irrigation systems, it would free up time for parks workers, residents, and would produce healthy trees. By irrigating parkland, you can improve quality of life, intercept stormwater, conserve energy, remove air pollutants, and reduce carbon dioxide. Out of CD6's sixteen parks, Augustus St. Gaudens Playground, Bellevue South Park, and St. Vartan Park are the only three with sprinkler systems. Parks with sprinklers can be used as cooling stations on hot days in New York City. Out of CD6's sixteen parks, Asser Levy and Stuyvesant Square Park are the only two with functioning fountains. Community Board 6 advocates for water in all of our parks, especially in the parks with dog runs like Robert Moses and Peter Detmold, to keep our animals hydrated.   Additional Parks Staff for CD6   CB6 continues to stress the need for increased staffing at parks and recreation centers. Upkeep would improve with specialty staff such as a dedicated district gardener, city parks workers, and additional welders. As we address these maintenance issues, we seek better security from additional PEP officers and cameras for the southern command. The importance of access to public parks was amplified during the pandemic when individuals sought respite in the parks. In a time of reduced funds overall, it is essential that funding for PEP officers, professional gardeners, and parks clean up workers at least is not cut. ","In CD6 we host two important museums with distinguished collections, eleven theaters, and eight music venues or schools. CB6 is always supportive of existing and enhanced supportive programs that allow these smaller theaters and lower-key museums to thrive, through direct grants or via funding to community organizations that utilize them. CB6 also acknowledges that schools and universities in our district, as well as long-standing art institutes, contribute to cultural creation. Additionally, public works of art are considered of benefit in CD6, and we welcome the continued use of corporate or public plazas to host artistic installations that enhance the cultural program of the area. We also encourage a conversation to identify additional locations for public art in our district. CB 6 also encourages partnership with local Business Improvement Districts to support the implementation of cultural events, connecting residents to these experiences. ","CB6 asks that the Mayor and the City Council recognize that our public libraries are needed now more than ever and the physical plant for libraries must be structurally sound and technologically up to date. Programming should address the varied needs of our diverse communities.  While we are grateful for the recent renovations to the main NYPL building, CB6 supports capital and expense funding increases for libraries, especially in light of the closure of the Grand Central Library.  Libraries in New York City and nationwide have always been a valued resource, providing literacy training, GED preparation, STEAM, and after-school programs.  Programs like these can uplift New York City's youth, building a support net for a brighter future. Virtually all libraries, 98 percent, offer free public Wi-Fi access, which is a great resource for afterschool study and for remote employees. CB6 advocates for additional programming, educational resources, and electronic resources in all of CD6's branches. Additionally, programs for population subgroups, such as seniors  are increasingly provided by libraries, and as requested of DFTA, we believe the library system should increase its services to older New Yorkers seeking social and educational stimulation. The period of Covid-related lockdown and period of limited access to city services showed us how valuable the branch libraries are in providing their lending library functions, computer access, and programming. It also pointed out the need for some redesign of the internal spaces of the branches so that they might remain open or open more quickly in another such emergency situation. We understand that our District branches have addressed many of the Covid related adjustments that needed to be made. However, we urge the NYPL to study the possibilities of multiple uses and alternative interior configurations to meet future needs. As far as budgetary impacts, we acknowledge the funding received in recent years has been put to good use and should additional funds not be available, the current budget level should at least be baselined. ","In 2018 CB6 moved into new office space, satisfying a long- standing desperate need. The location and facilities should meet the Board's everyday office space requirements for years to come.   However, we anticipate difficulty in finding and obtaining approval to use larger spaces for meetings that have broad concern in the neighborhood.  With the proposed redevelopment of the Brookdale site in our district (along 1st Avenue between 25th and 26th Streets), a dedicated office/meeting space of at least 3,000 square feet should be reserved for the community board.   Other Than Personal Services (OTPS) budgets will need to reflect the high inflationary environment. During this time of tight budgets but major transitions for business needs , we urge that, at a minimum, previous community board budget increases be baselined and, to the extent possible, increased to reflect the greater expertise required by existing staff and specialized backgrounds for future hires.

Our District is home to 207,700,people (according to the 2020 Census), down from 209,084 in 2010.    The Upper West Side is a vibrant community. Residents and millions of visitors are attracted to it's cultural institutions, parks, retail, restaurants, and diverse architecture. Prominent points of interest include Central Park, Riverside Park, the American Museum of Natural History, the New York Historical Center, the Bard Center, the Children's Museum, Lincoln Center, the Beacon Theater, Symphony Space,  Time Warner Center and numerous houses of worship.  Even though tourism was greatly reduced during the pandemic, residents and tourists are now venturing out in greater numbers.  Public Transportation is easily accessible with 5 major subway lines, 4 crosstown bus lines, and 5 north-south bus lines.  Yet sadly there are too many in our community struggling in pockets of poverty. While median household income in 2019 was $139,070 compared to $70,590 City wide, 9.2% live below the poverty line. 25% are food insecure. The district,has the third largest proportion of seniors in the City, many with limited resources and a variety of special needs (seniors make up 20.4% of the population) Over 32.3% of the population is rent burdened.. The district continues to lose its stock of affordable housing, making it harder for the working poor and the middle class to remain in the district. Over 6,000 units of public housing for low income residents are in desperate need of major repair and upgrading. Cuts to programs and services during the Pandemic have created serious problems for vulnerable children and adults. ","","","","","Affordable Housing","","Affordable housing is the district’s most critical need and its lack contributes to a myriad of other issues facing district residents -- homelessness, food insecurity, social and emotional problems, inadequate health care and domestic violence.  Only 26% of housing is considered affordable.  Over 23% of Manhattan Community Board 7 (MCB7) residents are severely rent burdened, paying more than 50% of their income on rent.  The District continues to lose affordable housing stock, and  the apartments in the NYCHA developments continue to deteriorate and th  In addition, a significant percentage of units are illegally warehoused.  The vacancy rate in MCD7 is almost double that of the City as a whole (12.4% versus 6.9% for New York City). The recent end of the State-imposed moratorium on evictions from residential and commercial properties sets the stage for greater dispossession and homelessness, further deepening the personal crises facing many MCB7 families.","Schools","","The most vulnerable children in our district face the steepest barriers to accessing local educational, social and mental health resources. The estimated percentage of children under 18 living in poverty in the district grew from 6.5% in 2010 to 9.3% in 2019.  The Pandemic has further increased this percentage.  Inflation has also increased the number of children and families that are food insecure  There are 22,000 students in public schools (pre-K through 12 grade) in Community District 7 (CD7), who comprise most of  Community School District 3 (CSD3), which continues north into West Harlem with a few schools not in CD7. CSD3 is among the most diverse districts in the New York City public school system, whether measured by race, ethnicity, socio-economic status or student performance, yet many of the schools in the district do not reflect that diversity.  Free and reduced-price lunch eligibility, a Federal measure of poverty, comprised 43.9% of K-8 students and 54% of high school students in CSD3.  increased overcrowding is caused by the rising influx of migrant children.  These racial and economic disparities mean that many children are in schools that are underserved by the school system and by after-school programming. To address these equity problems, there is an urgent need to target the budgets of the Department of Education and the Department of Youth and Community Development on Community District 7’s pockets of poverty, to fund Summer Rising, to add professional staff and to provide after school programs.","Social services","","Food insecurity: Twenty five percent of Community District 7 (CD7) residents are food insecure.  The Meal Gap, New York City’s measure of food insecurity, represents families’ and individuals’ missing meals that result from inadequate household food budgets. In CD7, the annual Meal Gap is 4 million meals, up from 3.3 million pre Pandemic. This gap directly impacts community health and health care costs.   Every person needs stable, reliable access to food that meets their specific nutritional requirements.  Many seniors rely on meals at their local Senior Center and/or from food pantries.  Children rely on free meals at public schools, but lack food on the weekends and school holidays.   Hunger impacts a child’s nervous system and prevents that child from learning and staying focused.  Food insecurity is also a leading cause of lifelong health and mental health issues.   Meal programs and food pantries face ongoing increases in costs of meals (due to labor and raw food costs) without a corresponding increase in government funds and donated food. The need for increased government support is compelling.  Westside Campaign Against Hunger has provided over 300,000 meals in the past year","","","","","Programs, services or facilities for seniors (incl. remote programming, cooling centers)","","Community District 7 is home to an increasing number of senior citizens and to Naturally Occurring Retirement Communities (NORCs) which receive funds targeted for aging populations. A NORC at Douglass Houses (where there are more than 1000 underserved seniors) is needed.  Lack of health and household services and visitor contact contributes to the institutional placement of many seniors who otherwise would have been able to stay in their home. Extended In-Home Service to the Elderly Program, which provides homemaking for vulnerable homebound seniors not eligible for Medicaid, has seen drastic budget cut. The Adult Social Day Services Program, which provides therapeutic programs for seniors who are disabled (many with dementia) was eliminated. Funds for Elder Abuse Prevention Programs and Geriatric Mental Health Initiatives have not increased with the growing number of seniors. United Neighborhood house funding has remained stagnant. Volunteers and funds are needed to fill in many gaps.","District Need: Health coverage and public benefit enrollment assistance. At St. Luke's and Mt. Sinai West, a ""HEAL"" office assists patients who do not have insurance in enrolling in insurance or Medicaid; and offers payment plans for services according to Medicare rates. The Ryan Center charges patients based upon their income. Additional sites offering similar services are needed to reach all CD7 residents. District Need: More access to financial counseling and legal assistance is needed for people who are unable to pay medical bills (e.g., reports to collections, litigation).  District Need: More information and access to comprehensive and preventative care is needed for low-income patients, including for infant nutrition and to support pregnant mothers.  District Need:  Funding to increase awareness of available relief from Covid-related bills via marketing and communications efforts, both about the appeal process and about providers who are positioned to help guide clients through the process. District Need: More funding for mental health services in jails and for justice-involved youth transitioning from jails. District Need: Health care access for  out-of-school/out-of-work (OSOW) youth. According to census data 11 percent of youth aged 16 to 24 in Community District 7 are considered ""disconnected"" or OSOW.  Over the decade prior to the pandemic, the city's OSOW population declined by nearly 40 percent, largely due to sustained improvements in the high school graduation rate and consistent job growth, but remained at one in eight 16 to 24 year-old New Yorkers before Covid-19..  The OSOW population in the City is overwhelmingly black and hispanic.  District Need: Increase education and programs, such as NYC Smoke-Free, to prevent and reduce vaping (use of e-cigarettes) and other forms of addiction. While the sale and distribution of e-cigarettes, vapor products or liquid nicotine to persons under age 21 is now prohibited in New York State, and use among high school students has declined, E-cigarettes remain a cause of negative health impacts, including lung damage among the young, and may increase the risk of severe illness from Covid-19. The Food and Drug Administration, faced with a September 2021 deadline for ruling on whether a number of vape products could remain on the market, stated that they need more time to complete their review of applications for Juul products and other top brands, which meanwhile remain available.  NYC Smoke-Free works with schools in CD7 and would benefit from more support to have greater reach and impact. District Need: The Department of Health and Mental Hygiene should collect and report more information to the public and Community Board on lead poisoning, including any initial positive test, any retest results, and results six months later; as well as findings of investigations. District need: Embrace the clubhouse model of rehabilitation for people with mental illness.  Clubhouses, like Fountain House in Hell's Kitchen, are community centers where people with mental illness find oportunities for friendship, employment, housing, education and medical and psychiatric services in a caring and safe environment.  A clubhouse is urgently needed in our District. ","A large percentage of seniors in the district reside in New York City Public Housing. District Need: Senior centers, a necessary lifeline for seniors to maintain connections to necessary health and social services, must be adequately funded, kept in good repair and maintained. The Department For The Aging must always ensure that they are properly staffed.   District Need: Thousands of seniors and residents eligible for the Senior Citizen Rent Increase Exemption (SCRIE) and the Disability Rent Increase Exemption (DRIE) are not currently enrolled in those programs, and therefore may be paying more rent than necessary despite their limited incomes. This underenrollment is of particular concern as many seniors are outliving their retirement savings. Community Board 7 urges the Department of Housing Preservation and Development to expand community outreach to senior centers and non-profit organizations and provide more information, including informational sessions, to ensure that every qualified resident is getting proper rent increase exemptions. Additionally many seniors need to be enrolled in SNAP bebefuts,  NORs need additional funding for nurses and contractors.  All programs need Cost of Living (DOLA) adjustments. ","District Need: Provide technology devices, infrastructure and support. Shelter and supportive housing residents as well as those living outside in Community District 7 need access to a) technology, including Wifi, cell service, and hardware; and b) staff to conduct training on how to use that technology. This is urgently needed for residents to communicate with medical and mental health providers and access care as well as have educational and economic opportunities (Goddard Riverside). Children and youth experiencing homelessness need technology access for remote learning.   District Need: Provide Consistent preventive services and treatment in shelters. The Coalition for the Homeless has documented the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on shelter residents and the street homeless. Those experiencing homelessness are particularly vulnerable to Covid-19 due to lack of consistent access to cleaning and sanitation facilities and supplies; access to face coverings; screening upon entry to shelters; distance from those testing positive for Covid-19; ability to access DHS staff when ill; access to free testing; timely notification of test results; timely isolation placements when ill; and following protocols.  District Need: Provide funding to maintain current services for supportive housing facilities in Community District 7, including case management services, social work, mental health services, health services related to medication, nutrition, and social activities. Supportive housing is another effective way to end homelessness for individuals and families, especially those living with physical and psychiatric disabilities. Even prior to the pandemic, there was not sufficient supply to meet the record demand, and state reimbursement rates for supportive housing lagged behind operational costs. Providing housing first gets people back on their feet and allows them to pull their lives together more quickly. As one example, research has shown a 50% decrease in alcoholism when people who are homeless are housed.  District Need: Provide designated housing for specific homeless populations. Additional designated housing is needed specifically for women, victims of domestic violence, people who identify as transgender or gender nonconforming, and people with HIV. In addition, more housing is needed which would allow residents to keep pets, as animal prohibitions are often a barrier to entering shelters. And more designated space for families is needed to ensure children have the stability they need for growth, mental health, and educational equity.  District Need: Monthly data by district to support the homeless population in their community. Without current data, it is impossible to act and communicate from an informed position about the needs, conditions, services, and supports for those experiencing homelessness in our community. At a minimum, communities need monthly statistics on shelters by type, district, resident demographics (e.g., family composition, age, gender, race, disabilities), and capacity. In addition, statistics on Covid-19 infection, hospitalization, and mortality rates among the homeless would assist local organizations in targeting aid.  Of concern is the disparate impact of DHS's decisions for particular populations, such as young adults or people with disabilities, which is impossible to assess without data.   District Need: Provide additional disaggregated data from city agencies to enable evaluation of fair share claims, and revise outdated criteria as recommended by the City Council (NYC Council, 2017). ","Families and individuals with low incomes face myriad difficulties including access to affordable housing, healthy nutritious food, quality education, as well as health and social services.  Because too many households in the District are rent burdened they are also food insecure; many aren't able to afford necessary medication. The City needs to incentivize developers to include a mix of of income levels in all new developments.  (See section on Housing). The threat of eviction and homelessness is a major concern.   District Need:  The New York City Public Housing developments in the District need to be adequately repaired and maintained, including all individual apartments and all buildings. Elevators, security systems, heat and hot water, front doors and grounds all need to be in proper working order. District Need:  Social service providers lack funding to provide programming and services for the specific and unique needs of this population including training, help accessing resources, child care, access to health care and medicine and access to educational and vocational opportunities.   District need: Provide access to technology including Wi-Fi and internet service and hardware to enable residents to have access to health services, educational and employment oportunities and other services.    ","","","","","Educational attainment","","Schools in Community District 7/Manhattan are again facing shrinking budgets, raising questions about whether they will have the funding required to provide the support needed to address the needs created by adverse conditions and trauma caused by the Pandemic.    Enrollment is a central component in how the Department of Education (DOE) provides funding; it is presently complicated by the increasing enrollment of children of asylum seekers.  While adequate funding does not translate directly to student achievement, it is a necessary precondition. The Department of Education’s Fair Student Funding (FSF) formula determines a dollar amount for each student weighted for the costs associated with the services that student requires.  Additionally there is a rising number of unhoused students.  There are increasing needs for language programs, social and medical services.  Not every school has a dedicated nurse and social worker. Second, there are issues with Title 1 funding. Many schools in the district do not meet the cut-off that determines eligibility for Federal title 1 Funding, the principle source of dedicated resources for poor students (in Manhattan schools must have 50% of their students eligible for free or reduced lunch).  Schools that are not eligible may have 40% or more of their students living in poverty requiring additions services without dedicated funds. While Covid related funds are spent down, the gap will increase. Third schools are seeing overall reductions in their budgets vs the 2021-2022 due to the gradual phasing out of the Federal relief funding.  The needs of the students have not waned; indeed the learning losses due to school closures and remote learning and the trauma experienced by so many public school students has increased the need for academic and social/emotional supports for many years to come. The Districts' educational programs require continued attention and support .  ","The Covid pandemic has challenged all areas of our educational system and, as in so many other areas of civic life, called into even starker contrast and exacerbated pre-existing inequities in public education Though remote and hybrid learning proved an inferior substitute for in-person learning for most students during the last school year, the most vulnerable students and families in the District and Citywide faced the steepest barriers to accessing the educational resources needed, including:  a shortage of working laptops, tablets and other devices;  difficulty accessing reliable and fast Wifi (especially for those in NYCHA housing and homeless facilities);  and challenges accessing in a timely fashion the mandated full program of services for students with special needs.  As a result, NYC public school students entered the 2021-2022 school year with unprecedented levels of academic and social/emotional need, requiring unprecedented levels of support as the City seeks to mitigate the impact of the past 18 months, combat learning loss, and ensure that students have the tools they require to be successful, both in the classroom and in life. The goals as laid out in the New York City Universal Academic Recovery plan, combined with the full funding of the Fair Student Funding formula, align with many of the most critical needs currently being experienced by the schools in our District.  Sustaining these services into FY 2022-2023, however, will require finding alternative funding sources as one-time federal funds are depleted.  With the Delta Variant surging and additional variants beginning to spread, schools will face ongoing Covid-related needs into FY 2023 and beyond. ","Community District 7 families with children have long relied heavily on services provided by the City Department of Youth and Community Development (DYCD).  The Covid-19 pandemic has revealed how critical this reliance is to significant numbers of parents, guardians and caregivers -- and the economy that employs them. Access to DYCD funded services addresses both the needs of students whose lives have been disrupted and the needs of parents for a safe, enriching  environment for their children during the afterschool and summer workday.   Programs that care for children and youth when schools are not in session are crucial to the wellbeing of young people in MCD7, providing a safe refuge for children and youths who would otherwise be prey to dangerous influences, including gang activity.  These programs provide remedial and enrichment learning opportunities, physical activity, productive ""downtime"",  plus social and emotional support crucial to the physical and mental health of young people, especially the most vulnerable.  These DYCD programs are coordinated with community-based organizations and within schools as after class activities and serve the elementary, middle and high school levels, as well as young adults to the age of 24yrs. They include the BEACON, COMPASS and CORNERSTONE programs, Adult Literacy, Homeless Youth Services, Street Outreach, Drop-in Service Centers, Residential Services, Services for Immigrants and Immigrant Families and Workforce Development. Their continuation is critical to the well-being of families in Community Board 7, particularly the most needy.  District Need: Modify funding formulas for afterschool programs to acknowledge pockets of poverty, not just area average household income.  Service providers report challenges procuring funding for afterschool programs for elementary age children from low-income families in Manhattan Community District 7 due to metrics which factor in average household income in the populations they serve.  Upper West Side neighborhoods have significant income disparity, requiring more refined metrics to serve low income students equitably.  District Need: More research to determine community needs and availability of mental health services for youth, including depression, anxiety, and suicide risk assessment and prevention. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, intentional self-harm (suicide) is one of the leading causes of death for children aged 5-14 years. ","","","","","Traffic violations and enforcement","","for many years CB7/M has requested enforcement to al traffic rules: motor vehicles failing to yield, motor vehicle speeding, ebikes failing to yield, e-bikes speeding, any bikes and scooters etc. riding on the sidewalks, bikes and motorized scooters etc riding the wrong way in bike lanes and on streets.  There have been several fatalities and multiple injuries to both pedestrians and passengers of other vehicles.  Special attention needs to be given to schools, older adult centers, parks and playgrounds, and many busy intersectio","Safety is a major concern for residents and visitors in our community.  All public spaces need to be safe for all users.    District Need: Restore overtime funding for the New York Police Department in the 20th, 24th and Central Park Precincts. Overtime is an effective way to supplement the ability of the police to respond to changing circumstances and create a presence when needed. With the use of certain data models for permanent assignment of officers, the use of overtime is needed to fill in gaps of coverage, respond to exigencies, and evenly distribute workflow, and will enable officers familiar with their own precincts to be the ones to respond to such exigencies and needs. ","The pandemic highlighted the importance of emergency services in the District.  The Fire Department played a major role along with the Police Department in keeping the community safe.  EMT and the ambulances of area hospitals worked tirelessly to provide care and get patients safely to hospitals.  Local hospitals and medical facilities, and pharmacies have been invaluable in caring for residents, providing Covid-19 vaccination and testing sites.  We are indebted to and  proud of the continuing courageous work by our Fire and Police officers. They work closely with other City agencies to maintain the public safety during storms, floods, fires,  and infrastructure breakdowns.  They are too often the unsung heroes.  District Need: Provide sufficient funds for the Fire Department for overtime and for infrastructure.  District Need:  More funding is needed for the NYPD Sex Crimes Unit to increase staffing and reduce caseloads. ","","","","","Cleanliness/trash collection","","Deep cuts to the budget of the Department of Sanitation driven by revenue shortfalls in the early days of the Pandemic have had a lasting impact on the Upper West Side: the rat population has expanded dramatically. City-wide, rodent complaints to 311 increased by 80% from March 2020 to March 2021.  Speculation is that rats relocated from the central business district as workers moved to remote work and the restaurants that fed them closed.  As outdoor eating, and its attendant garbage, expanded in residential neighborhoods like the Upper West Side, so did the rat population.  Federal funds from the American Rescue Act enabled the restoration in spring 2021 of litter basket service, cut 54% the prior year.  However, rat infestations in areas not usually prone to them remain a problem as New York continues on the path of reopening.  The September 6, 2021 New York Post features a picture of the great blue heron in Central Park swallowing a giant rat.  Community District 7 has many buildings with signs of rats and failed inspections compared to other districts. In addition to expanding current initiatives (such as the expansion of rat-proof trash cans by the Department of Sanitation), new approaches to the rat problem would include working with businesses to eliminate rat-friendly conditions, shifting pickup times to make sure trash is not left out overnight, continuing and publicizing education programs like the Rat Academy, and prioritizing high-risk areas using GIS and data tracking to target trouble spots and pinpoint rat dens. In addition, education of building managers, tenant associations, block associations and enforcement by the Department of Sanitation are essential to controlling the pest population in a safe and effective manner.","Factors that complicate efforts to address the impacts of climate change on our District include the fact that most development is allowed to proceed as-of-right without robust environmental review. Storm drains, roadways and open spaces are frequently flooded by the increased frequency of major storms.    District Need:  it is incumbent upon the City to require all new development to review existing loads for water, sewage, electrical and sanitation (composting and garbage collections). The City needs to develop more incentives to encourage  energy efficient and green design construction. This will require changes to the Zoning Resolutions and funding for these initiatives for those who are barely able to conform to current regulations.  District Need:  The City needs strategies to address forecasts that climate change - rising sea levels and more frequent catastrophic storms -  will overwhelm storm sewers and drainage runoff systems, which then discharge human and solid waste into the Hudson River.  District Need:  The City needs to continue upgrading its water pumping stations and network of pipes.   ","Sanitation services were reduced during the pandemic, resulting in increased litter overflowing litter boxes and enabling the rat population to increase.  District Need: Install additional solar trash compactors and trash cans in Community District 7 and maintain litter basket collection at 7 days a week.  Due to budget cuts at DSNY in 2020, sanitation conditions in Community District 7 deteriorated.  The increase in Park visitors due to the Pandemic resulted in an increase in trash volume, which has contributed to flooding by clogging drains.  The exposed waste, mostly food, has led to an explosion of the rat population.  Solar trash compactors (such as the ""Big Belly'') are needed in Verdi, Strauss, and Riverside Parks, as well as a variety of playgrounds in the district.  Additionally, more trash cans are needed throughout the district - at least two on blocks with greenmarkets and one on all other blocks.  District Need:  Restore the Composting collecting program to its pre-pandemic levels. ","","","","","Condition of public housing","","The lack of affordable housing is the highest priority issue in Community District 7, contributing to a range of social and economic crises among residents. The three major complexes in the district run by the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) -- Amsterdam Houses, Stephen Wise Towers and Frederick Douglass Houses -- together comprise a significant portion of the local affordable housing stock. Recently NYCHA placed Wise Towers and many of the small buildings in its vicinity into a Rental Assistance Demonstration program which will maintain and manage those buildings.  The remaining buildings, which  will continue to be managed by NYCHA, have been poorly maintained for decades.  Problems include the need for improved security, facility repairs, non-working boilers, unreliable elevators, need for effective and efficient mold and lead remediation, and lack of affordable, reliable broadband service necessary for connecting residents to educational programming, tele-health, social services and workforce opportunities.   The complexes suffer from inadequate resources for youth and senior programs and poor sanitation services. In addition, residents and local officials face a lack of accountability from NYCHA management and a labyrinthine process for troubleshooting and redressing on-going maintenance needs.  Community District 7 requests increased capital and expense funding for NYCHA to address these problems as well as more responsiveness to tenant and community concerns.","Preserving the character, place and quality of life for all is a guiding principle of urban land use. In the past few years there have been lawsuits against excessively high, non-contextual buildings and zoning lot mergers in Community District 7. The construction on these sites was unexpected, leading to vigorous community opposition, and creating negative environmental impacts on the surrounding neighborhood, including loss of air and light as well as permanent shadows on parks and playgrounds at various times of the day. District Need:  Greater community involvement in rezoning is critical.  All zoning loopholes permitting out-of-scale construction should be closed.  Reforms to the Bureau of Standards and Appeals should support this effort. The Lincoln Square Special District requires rezoning to include the former properties where ABC has had their studios on Columbus Avenue, West 66 and West 67th Streets. Community Board 7 has joined with Landmarks West in supporting a ULURP application to that effect. District Need:  Provide funds for inspection of sidewalk sheds and scaffolding to ensure that sheds and scaffolds are not left in place for unreasonably long times while no work is being done. District Need:  Provide funds to the Department of Buildings for additional inspectors to inspect buildings during construction. ","The City should expand the Mandatory Inclusionary Housing (MIH) program to all new residential and mixed-use buildings rather than confine it to a few rezoned areas in poorer neighborhoods. New buildings would be required to allocate 20 percent of floor area to permanent rent-restricted apartments for lower- and middle-income households.  New affordable housing is needed on a vast scale, with availability in diverse areas with differing economic structures, sometimes known as Universal Affordable Housing. This change would increase needed economic diversity. District Need:  Developers need to be incentivized to include a mix of income levels in any new developments in the District. There has been a significant reduction in the availability of housing that is accessible to those with incomes at 100-150 percent of Area Median Income.  Rents are at an all-time high, making homes inaccessible to young adults (including those who cannot afford to live in the communities in which they grew up), as well as to young families and older people who have lived in the neighborhood for decades.  New construction all too often creates residential units that sell or rent at luxury rates beyond the reach of many New Yorkers with moderate incomes.    District Need: The City could require special permits for buildings over a certain size to provide permanent affordable housing in those buildings based on the amount of additional height resulting from zoning lot mergers and transfers of air rights.  District Need: The City needs to investigate the potential for funding the conversion of vacant and/or underutilized hotels into permanent affordable apartments, with supportive services if needed, managed by a local service provider, thus providing permanent housing for families and single adults.  District Need:  The City needs to survey publicly-owned land in the district and under-built lots, including lots containing one-story firehouses, police stations, libraries and other community resources  which have the potential to be developed into new facilities for these City agencies, incorporating affordable housing above.   District Need: The SROs that are currently threatened with conversion should be purchased by the City through the Neighborhood Pillars Program creating rent-regulated units managed by nonprofit housing providers. District Need: Prevent landlords from warehousing apartments to make them available to renters. ","Prior to the pandemic it was becoming difficult for many retail and local small businesses to survive.  Both ""mom-and-pop"" and chain stores were shuttering at an alarming rate.  Banks started shuttering branch offices and large chain pharmacies did as well. According to Patch, 42 chain stores have closed in the District; a 21% decrease in area code 10023, an 18% decrease in area code 10024, and a 14% decrease in area code 10025.  In September of 2020 Borough President Gale Brewer's staff surveyed vacancies of store fronts on Broadway from 59th to 96th street; there were 66 vacant store fronts.   The Covid-19 pandemic has caused greater turmoil for local businesses including restaurants, retail, banking and other small businesses.  When the order to ""shelter in place"" began, grocery stores and some essential businesses remained open.  Those who were able to work from home relied heavily on shopping on the internet and using services like insta-cart for home delivered food and supplies.  Delivery businesses thrived, while local merchants and restaurateurs relied on government loans and assistance.  Many businesses closed permanently.  Double parked delivery trucks clog the already congested streets.  Bike delivery personnel are timed by how fast they deliver food to customers, which creates havoc in busy bike lanes and on the street. Consumers are returning to shop locally and to eat in restaurants. New rules by the Department of Transportation have been a big help to local restaurants, coffee shops and bakeries, allowing them to create outdoor dining in protected areas on the street. Our local cultural institutions, newly opened, are attracting local residents and tourists.  The City and State need to continue to ensure that businesses, restaurants and cultural institutions are able to thrive in our District.  Our three Business Improvement Districts have been working around the clock to keep their areas clean and safe and to improvise on ways to help their area businesses. ","","","","","Pedestrian safety (safer crossings, sidewalk management, etc.)","","With cars and delivery trucks, the Open Restaurants Program, increased bicycle use and growth in motorcycle and other motorized vehicle traffic all competing for space on the streets of the Upper West Side, the Goal of Vision Zero has become more difficult to reach.  From September 2020 to September 2021, there were 405 traffic injuries in Community District 7 -- 217 to motorists, 97 to pedestrians and 91 to cyclists.  There were 6 deaths, 4 of them pedestrians. While total collisions of all kinds for 2021 through September 12 declined from the same period in 2020 (to 765 from 823) the percent of collisions with injuries showed a 25% increase.  The Department of Transportation has taken numerous steps to address the increased congestion and potential for injury, including implementing safety upgrades at many intersections, including the West End Avenue Corridor.  Manhattan Community Board 7 supports the use of tools that will improve safety, including: curb extensions, pedestrian islands, protected bike lanes, mid-block bulb-outs, split-phase signals, leading pedestrian intervals, raised crosswalks, left turn bans, Barnes Dances, narrowed lanes, abrupt changes in road surface, and lower speed limits - all tools which, when implemented district-wide, could reduce speeding and failure to yield (two leading causes of pedestrian deaths).   Continuous and consistent enforcement of the 25 mile per hour speed limit, and the 20 mile per hour speed limit around all schools, would improve pedestrian and student safety.  Major concerns are the failure of all vehicles, bikes, ebikes, scooters etc to yield to pedestrians, running red lights, and bikes, ebikes, scooters riding the wrong way and riding on sidewalks. Specific areas where the Department of Transportation could focus to address pedestrian safety issues include: The ​corridor between 95th and 100th Streets, super-block ​west of Central Park West; Continued monitoring of ​Commercial Loading Zones ​- along the redesigned Amsterdam and Columbus Avenues and also along Central Park West and West End Avenue; Narrowing travel lanes on West 66th Street between Amsterdam and West End Avenues​, along with curb extensions in order to discourage speeding on the wide street. (A similar design was implemented on 70th Street.) Changing the timing on the traffic signal at ​66th Street and West End Ave ​to discourage speeding to make the light. Addition of crosstown protected bike lanes. Addition of signage at the 79th & 96th St interchanges of the Henry Hudson Pkwy alerting motorists to the 25 mph speed limit unless otherwise posted and No Right turns at red lights. There is an increased need to look at creating deviated bike lanes on cross town streets ","District Need: Managing Competing Street Uses The ​""Complete Streets"" ​on Amsterdam and Columbus Avenues create new challenges for Community District 7 to balance the needs of pedestrians, cyclists, motorists and local businesses. ​Loading Zones ​are a serious concern for local businesses and residents, because they reduce curbside parking. Some have argued that raising the price and timing of metered parking would increase turnover at available curbside spaces. Double Parking ​has become a problem on all the Avenues in Community.  Community Board 7 requests that the Department of Transportation implement as soon as possible the loading zone plan adopted by our Board for Central Park West and West End Avenue to mitigate this problem. Mixing Zones: ​Mixing Zones increase the risk for cyclists, who often cannot be seen by the driver of the motor vehicle and there have been some serious injuries.  The mixing zones where motor vehicles enter the bike lanes to turn create a danger for cyclists who are often in the blind spot for the driver of the vehicle. District Need: Supporting Pedestrian Safety and Sidewalk Access Pedestrian Islands ​provide refuge and shorter crossing distances for pedestrians and thrill gardeners who enjoy tending the tree pits. Shared Sidewalks: ​The increased congestion on sidewalks of local residents, tourists and visitors has emboldened ​street vendors ​to take advantage of new markets. The proliferation of food trucks and sidewalk vendors frustrates Upper West Siders because of the lack of enforcement and/or licensing. Additionally, ​street furniture ​(newsstands, bus shelters, bike rack, news boxes, pay phones, mail boxes, benches, etc.) and ​sidewalk cafes ​overcrowd the sidewalks. Community Board 7 encourages a comprehensive approach to optimizing shared use and management of sidewalks to eliminate obstructions and visual clutter. Community Board 7 encourages minimizing permanently ​enclosed sidewalk cafes ​especially after they have become vacant. Except in rare circumstances, enclosed cafes unduly narrow the sidewalk and cause pedestrian congestion. Perhaps a mechanism could be created to guarantee the removal of structures when they become vacant. District Need: Balancing Parking Needs and Congestion Mitigation: ​While car ownership by residents of the district is down, Community District 7 residents have strong and varied opinions about the amount of paid private garage space to be allocated in the district. Increasing the amount of free parking would likely contribute to increased pollution, congestion, frustration, etc. The goal is to balance the need for access to motor vehicles while minimizing the negative aspects. District Need: Responsibly Regulate Emerging Technologies Community Board 7 supports the exploration of emerging technologies that can be implemented in the district as a way to safely and more equitably move people, goods and services within the District and throughout the City. These technologies include bike share, pedal-assist and motorized bikes, ride share/ride hail, electric scooters, autonomous vehicles, and civilian and possibly commercial drones. In many cases, these technologies can serve as valuable ""last mile"" solutions to successfully transport people to mass transit, which remains the most feasible option for the majority of Community District 7 residents, if funding and service issues are improved. These technologies also could help more efficiently and safely move goods to retail establishments or to the elderly or health care providers. Community Board 7 believes that the use of these emerging technologies, if regulated responsibly, could align with and potentially advance our core priorities related to a clean environment, affordable housing, equity among residents, and overall pedestrian and residential safety. ","During the pandemic the MTA made major cuts to train and bus service.  Ridership went down.   Ridership is still not back to pre-pandemic levels.  Community District 7 had the third largest number of subway riders in the City. Service cuts have caused off-peak trains to be overcrowded. District Need:  More frequent service on all lines, especially the C District Need: Transit signal prioritization is needed on major bus routes. Needed are additional safety measures to deal with the increase crime on the subway, the splatforms and in and around the stations.  Many people are afraid to use the subways because of the many reported incidents. Also needed: additional bus lanes with enforcement cameras to ensure enforcement,  additional on-street supervisions to improve Transit's response to operating conditions, especially on weekends; the M104 service should be extended back to East 42nd Street; M11 service level needs to be expanded to meet the new levels of ridership by seniors; M60 Select Bus Service needs to be extended South to 96th Street; and the M96 bus route needs to upgraded to Select Service. ","","","","","Quality of parks and park facilities","","Each child in Community District 7 needs a nearby playground in good working condition that is clean, updated and inviting. With the stresses on young people from disrupted school and family life during the pandemic, access to safe places to exercise is more important than ever.  Unhappily, the quality of play space across the district is dramatically uneven.  Equity and inclusion are increasingly recognized as issues in park funding and management. Certain parks, most notably Central Park through the Central Park Conservancy, and to a more modest extent Riverside Park through the Riverside Park Conservancy, enjoy  access to private donations and independent fundraising. Smaller neighborhood parks in Community District 7, like many similar spaces throughout our City, have no or limited access to such funding. Within Community District 7, the disparity in access to funding and its impact on the experience in public open space can readily be demonstrated by a comparison of the overall conditions of playgrounds north of West 96th Street versus those to the more affluent south.  As a down payment on park equity, Community Board 7 urges the Department of Parks and Recreation to provide funds to prioritize upgrades to two of our northern play spaces -- Frederick Douglass Playground and The Happy Warrior Playground. The Frederick Douglass Playground needs a total renovation of the playground, handball courts and a comfort station. It is used by a large population because it is adjacent to Frederick Douglass Houses (a large public housing complex) and several area schools.  The Happy Warrior Playground's basket ball court needs repair and the multipurpose athletic field has a big dip in it which collects water and needs to be completely rebuilt. This Playground is used by children of a variety of ages and is adjacent to several large public schools. These projects are ideal sites for the Community Parks Initiative, which decentralizes the task of meeting local needs by inquiring directly of local users and neighbors of parks and playgrounds what resources they most value, and in what priority certain investments should be made. ","The parks, playgrounds and public plazas provide essential outdoor space for residents and visitors to the district.  They are essential to health and well being.  They became even more valuable resources during the pandemic.  One of our guiding principles is that everyone have access, within walking distance, to outdoor space. There is a need to re-imagine how play and other spaces can be organized and used to provide for a variety of users and abilities.  Environmental impacts must also be taken into account in both planning and upkeep of faculties. (Please see our Capital and Expense Budget Priorities)  District Need: Critical funding for all parks in the District that are equitable and inclusive. ","During the pandemic museums, theaters and other cultural institutions closed.  They have recently opened with limitations on the numbers of visitors, making it difficult for them to cover costs. They are important for our community offering education, entertainment, and social outlets for residents and tourists.  They are essential to the economy of the District.  Visitors to these institutions spend money in local shops and restaurants, helping these businesses to remain open.  District Need:  The City needs to provide adequate funding for these important cultural and economic resources. ","Manhattan Community District 7 hosts four branches of the New York Public Library System (NYPL), including three circulating branches--St. Agnes, Bloomingdale and Riverside---and a research branch, Library for the Performing Arts, that serves local and city-wide needs in support of the cultural activities of the City.  The role of Libraries in the district has expanded over the past decades as the needs of their constituents changed.  No longer the primary source of reading material, libraries have taken on the role of ""community center"".  They provide access to classes in technical training, career building, social and recreational outlets and educational advancement.  Recently they have served as polling stations, cooling centers and Covid-19 vaccination sites.  Service has been expanded to serve senior centers, nursing homes, places of incarceration and a Bookmobile service. The Covid-19 Pandemic forced libraries to become more innovative in programming, moving many services online.  In collaboration with Lincoln Center, an outdoor reading room was created. The Department of Education used the St Agnes Library as a learning lab/day care center.   District Need: Manhattan Community Board 7 endorses the NYPL request for $50 million citywide for FY2023 and appreciates that the proposed cut of $20 million to the FY2022 budget was restored on a one-time basis.  ","For Community Board 7, as for all public agencies, serving the community over the last eighteen months has required ingenuity and flexibility, as Board meetings and outreach to the public became virtual and direct personal contact largely disappeared.  Uncertainties regarding future changes to the Open Meeting Law and the course of the Covid pandemic continue to impede planning.  District Need: Outreach from City officials to State elected representatives urging that they announce any changes to the Open Meeting Law well ahead of the January deadline embedded in current legislation.  District Need: Technical support from the Department of Information Technology & Telecommunications and the Manhattan Borough President on managing hybrid meetings, should that become an option. ","","","","","District Need: Communication to Combat Uncertainty and Anxiety In this century, only 9/11 created as much uncertainty surrounding all aspects of life as what our community is experiencing now with the Covid-19 pandemic.  The anxiety extends to economic well-being and jobs, personal and public health, housing and food security, political conflict and stagnation, and the risks of attending school versus the long-term consequences of missing out on an education.  Personal freedom is now a rallying cry in opposition to government guidance to prevent the spread of disease.  Polls show confidence in government generally is at low tide.  In this context, community boards, as the most local link in the New York City chain of government, need as much information as possible to provide accurate data to the community and to convey to other local officials the concerns of our residents.  We urge City government to use every possible means to communicate with community boards and to avoid, where possible, sudden policy changes without notice, such as occurred last year when hotels in the district received homeless individuals from congregate shelters. Successful implementation of sensitive changes requires preparation and planning requires time. ","","","","","","","","","","MN7","","","","","","","","","","",""

In addition to our diverse population, we are home to dozens of diplomatic residences, world famous hospitals, medical research centers, and world-renowned museums. According to the 2020 census, 231,983 people live on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, a 7.7% increase from 2010. Prosperous economic times and a major building boom that began during the 1990's have added thousands of new dwelling units to the district. Today, the district continues to grow at an amazing pace. The 1999 median household income for the District was $74,134.  Census data provided by the American Sommunity Survey in 2021 show 10% of the individuals in the district live below the poverty level. There is also a large segment of the population with special needs. More than 21% of CD8's residents are senior citizens, with a high number of frail elderly.  There is also a number of working poor living in the district.  With affordable housing becoming increasingly scarce, commercial rent escalating, and the prices of goods and services dramatically rising, our middle class residents are struggling to meet their budgets.  The influx of new residents, shoppers, and tourists have strained the delivery of municipal service. ","","","","","Affordable Housing","","Affordable Housing – The need for affordable housing continuously rates as a top issue in surveys of community residents and has long been a priority for Community Board 8.  A recent report from Columbia University found that between 2010 and 2021, the Upper East Side gained a net of only 101 housing units, one of the lowest citywide.  The trend in the district is towards tearing down older buildings and replacing them with larger luxury buildings that include fewer housing units.  The result has exacerbated the affordable housing challenges in our district. The loss of inventory is making it harder for people on lower incomes or young professionals to get a toe-hold in the neighborhood. In response to New York City’s (NYC) and the district’s lack of sufficient affordable housing units, the Board has voiced its overall support of retaining and increasing affordable housing in the district and recommends additional units in new developments be set aside as affordable units. Additionally, the Board recommends rescinding the NYC Administrative Code §26-511, C, 9 of the NYC Rent Stabilization Law of 1969, a law that has increased institutional expansion within the district. The Board further recommends additional investments in NYCHA housing to bring the apartments up to a state of good repair.","Parks and open space","","Parks and Open Space – COVID-19 highlighted the relationship between parks and public health, public safety, climate resilience, and quality of life. Parks are critical infrastructure and must be funded as such.  That is why we are calling for the mayor to keep his campaign pledge and commit to a percent for parks plan.  Parks are not a luxury; they are a necessity and should therefore be funded as such.  The Parks Department lacks the resources to properly maintain our parks and keep our parks safe with adequate levels of parks maintenance staffing and PEP officers. Additional capital funding is needed to fix the East River Esplanade from 77-80th Streets to stop the cycle of repairs and sinkholes; to fully repair and upgrade John Jay Park rather than doing the work in bits and pieces; to rehabilitate the restroom in Carl Schurz Park at 87th Street; to upgrade the seating and lighting at Stanley Isaacs Playground; to renovate Twenty Sycamores Park, Samuel Seabury Playground; and Phase 3 of Andrew Haswell Green Park. ","Quality of life issues (noise, graffiti, petty crime, etc.)","","Public Safety and Quality of Life – In a recent survey of CD8 residents, public safety and quality of life concerns topped the list of the most important issues facing the community.  While these are separate topics in the district needs statement, they reflect growing community concerns about safety and security. Although crime statistics have declined over the same period last year, there still remains an uptick in neighborhood crime and the concerns from residents were repeated throughout the community survey.  There is also an increase in homeless individuals on our neighborhood streets who are not obtaining the services and support they need.   ","","","","","Other - Write In (Required)","","Community Board 8 Manhattan remains strongly in favor of continued support for homeless services, mental health and substance abuse services, environmental health solutions, senior services, and domestic violence and elder abuse victim services, and supports public and private sector efforts to assist the diverse population in our community. We are particularly concerned that with the city's homeless population at record-setting levels, the Department for Homeless Services saw fit to promulgate, and persists in its attempts to implement, new shelter eligibility rules deemed likely to further swell the numbers of homeless single individuals. CB8M supports Safe Haven facilities that provide on-site social, health and recreational support services to pave a path to permanent housing.","The main programs for seniors are offered by Lenox Hill Neighborhood House (partially funded by the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA), Stanley M. Isaacs Neighborhood Center (a NYCHA facility), Carter Burden Center for the Aging, Roosevelt Island Senior Center, and Search and Care. CB8M has advocated for maintaining NYCHA social service programs, including the NYCHA senior centers at Lenox Hill and Stanley Isaacs, congregate meal programs, and the youth, family, and after school programs. CB8M remains strongly in favor of continued support for homeless services and supports public and private sector efforts to assist the diverse homeless population in our community. Our Community Board strongly supports the development of Safe Haven Sites run by experienced and well-regarded providers of Safe Haven services, such as Goddard Riverside. A top capital priority is increased funding for permanent affordable and supportive housing for homeless individuals and families. We support the efforts of the faith-based organizations to maintain their homeless shelter beds and of the food pantries in and out of our district to continue their work of feeding our hungry. Overall, the area of homeless services continues to be one of loss and insufficiency. There is an urgent need for additional programs that address the root causes of homelessness.  ","The population of our district includes the largest percentage of older adults, 60+, in Manhattan (20.8%).  A significant percentage of these (21.5%) live below the poverty level, or are frail, or both.  Contrary to popular perception, it also includes a varying but seemingly growing number of individuals without shelter. According to City Harvest 1.6 million New Yorkers of all ages experience food insecurity.  Visits to NYC pantries and soup kitchens are up 69% since 2019.  Food prices are rising at the fastest rate in decades.  Increased funding for food pantries and soup kitchens is essential to support the food insecure in our community.  In addition, a primary and consistent concern for our board is protecting the senior centers and programs that provide services to seniors regardless of income.  These centers and programs provide older members of the community with social interaction and nutrition, two elements vital to maintaining their long-term health and well-being.  It is imperative that senior center budgets be included in the Mayor's budget, and we urge that in the future critical senior programs such as case management and elder abuse prevention be treated as essential budget items. The main programs for seniors are offered by Lenox Hill Neighborhood House (partially funded by the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA), Stanley M. Isaacs Neighborhood Center (a NYCHA facility), Carter Burden Center for the Aging, Roosevelt Island Senior Center, and Search and Care. CB8M has advocated for maintaining NYCHA social service programs, including the NYCHA senior centers at Lenox Hill and Stanley Isaacs. ","We are particularly concerned that with the city's homeless population at record setting levels, the Department for Homeless Services saw fit to promulgate, and persists in its attempts to implement, new shelter eligibility rules deemed likely to further swell the numbers of homeless single individuals. ","CB8M continues to support strongly the services and programs aimed at aiding those of our community who are in need; they remain critically important. CB8M urges the City to respond strongly to this growing segment of our city's population. ","","","","","Other - Write In (Required)","","All of the above. Community Board 8 Manhattan would like to see more early childhood seats in the district.  As more family size apartments are being constructed in the district, there is a need for more early childhood 3-K seats.  We also request a location be identified to construct a new high school as many of the high school students in the district are matched with high schools far from their homes.  We must ensure that our neighborhood schools are fully accessible.  P.S. 158 Bayard Taylor, Yorkville East Middle School, and Eleanor Roosevelt High School are close to becoming fully accessible. CB8M recommends prioritizing accessibility upgrades at these three schools before making needed upgrades at other schools within the district. In addition, with migrant families being housed at the Bentley Hotel, there is a need to ensure adequate space to support educational opportunities for the children of migrants housed in this community.   In addition, CB8 strongly supports continuing increased funding for summer youth employment programs, after-school programming, youth workforce development and other summer employment, adolescent substance abuse, child welfare, adoption and foster care, and mental health services for youth.  We strongly urge the city to maintain high levels of funding for these programs and not cut funding in planned budget cuts. ","CB8M is extremely concerned about the lack of early childhood seats in the diestrict as well as the conversion of cluster rooms to regular classrooms and a lack of specialty teachers for art, music, etc. for the schools in our district. In addition, changes in high school admission policies have resulted in a substantial decrease in district high school offers to students who reside in the district.  The Board supports a diverse and inclusive school district and to meet the demand for high performing schools, supports the construction of new middle and high schools in the district.  There is also a need for increased funding for CUNY.  Youth and Community Services and Programs: The Board also recognizes the importance of providing adequate day care and after school facilities for our children.  There are many CD8 residents, especially single working parents, who need affordable day care and after school programs, but whose income slightly surpasses eligibility requirements.  Additional affordable programs are essential.  We continue to request increased funding for childcare and after-school programs, including infant care.

An important issue yet to be adequately addressed is the need for programs to prevent abuse and neglect.

Such therapies will increase family functioning while reducing the need for unnecessary and costly out of home care. ","","","","","Other - Write In (Required)","","All of the above. Community Board 8 Manhattan maintains a close working relationship with the 19th Precinct, Manhattan North, the Central Park Precinct, and the 114th Precinct, which serves Roosevelt Island from Queens. To enable the 19th Precinct to protect our community, the Board supports efforts to upgrade and repair the building that houses the 19th Precinct. This includes repairs to the precinct’s air conditioning system, which is currently supported by an external system parked on the street taking up three parking spots, generating noise, vibrations, and pollution, and creating an eyesore on the street. With record high temperatures experienced this summer and rising global temperatures, CB8M strongly encourages the city and the Police Department to prioritize essential repairs to this station house.  When CB8M surveyed residents to ascertain their district priorities, crime and public safety topped the list.  While crime statistics have declined somewhat this year, data shows major felonies are still up by almost 40 percent over two years ago, and the perception of the lack of safety and increase in crime is exacerbated by the increase in homeless and people with mental issues on the streets.  The Board strongly supports an increase in community policing in our neighborhoods and in our parks. The Board is concerned about the increased number of homeless in the community. CB8M continues to be concerned about bike enforcement and the number of scams and fraud against the elderly and vulnerable as well as Grand Larceny and Pedestrian Safety cases. CB8M would also like to see an increase in street vending enforcement as unlicensed food vendors are popping up around construction sites and siphoning business away from law-abiding, tax paying small businesses.","CB8M supports full funding for all fire and emergency medical services in our district and citywide.  CB8M is particularly concerned about the loss of fire marshals in recent years, and we have requested the restoration of funding for these personnel. ","CB8M supports the maintenance of emergency response capacity. The Board supports provision of ambulances with a mobile stroke treatment units.

We receive numerous complaints and are trying to be responsive to our residents and businesses about sanitation and the environment. We continue to be concerned about the increase in litter on the streets, the lack of big belly garbage bins to help control the rat population, as well as the condition of existing bins. We further request garbage bins be emptied on a more frequent basis, including composting bins, to ensure that there is capacity in the bins to support community interest in composting. We strongly urge additional enforcement of commercial property owners who fail to clean their sidewalk and 18 inches from the curb into the street, with emphasis on East 86th Street between Lexington and Second Avenues. We also need more garbage collections and street cleanings in an integrated approach to a cleaner community. We support more frequent sanitation inspections and efforts to consistently maintain presentable clean-swept sidewalks and streets. Recent storms have highlighted the critical need to protect our communities from rising sea levels and more frequent and severe storms. COVID-19 highlighted the critical need for broadband access for lower-income New Yorkers and especially for NYCHA residents. ","With work continuing on efforts to repair and reconstruct the tunnels and water mains that supply the City's clean drinking water, the Community Board supports continued efforts to increase the resiliency of our water infrastructure.  The Community Board also supports protecting our waterways and that includes support of the City's sewer infrastructure including the construction of more green and gray infrastructure, upgrading and cleaning of catch basins, including the installation of a new catch basin on the northwest corner of 72nd Street and Second Avenue to address significant water pooling at this intersection, and incentivizing rainwater capture in new building construction. ","CB8M is responsive to residents' concerns about sanitation and the environment. The cleanliness of our streets and neighborhoods is of great importance to our community and is related to successful business operations, to our well-being, and to the quality of life. The number of reported rat sightings is an all-time high.  In an integrated approach to a cleaner community, we support frequent sanitation inspections and efforts to consistently maintain presentable clean-swept sidewalks and streets. CB8M is concerned about the reduction in the frequency of street sweeping and the resulting increase in dirty streets and the increase in the rat population. CB8M is also concerned about the quality of garbage bins installed on street corners and the frequency with which the latch to the bins break. The community needs more garbage bins that do not break and more rat patrols and other rat control efforts, especially of empty lots and buildings. We support the Adopt-a-Basket program, and additional resources for education related to this program. CB8M also supports an expansion of composting sites and services throughout the community district. ","","","","","Other - Write In (Required)","","All of the above. Community Board 8 Manhattan opposes the taking of any common space for private development, while we recognize the need for additional affordable housing in our district. CB8M calls on the Department of City Planning to conduct a detailed analysis of the potential to convert specific blocks in CD8 that are currently zoned M1-4 or C8-4 with the goal of rezoning some or all of these blocks to residential use and any new developments subject to mandatory inclusionary housing requirements. ","CB8M seeks to preserve the Upper East Side's residential character and to maintain a careful balance to prevent new buildings from detracting from CD8's historic districts. CB8M believes that new and more effective regulations, coupled with increased enforcement, would ease this problem. Zoning changes including R8-B and R10-A were enacted to protect the midblock from massive structures and to govern use of the plaza bonus and towers on a base for avenues and cross-town streets but have not significantly moderated over-development in the district. in fact, new residential development in the district almost exclusively consists of market-rate and luxury apartments with little or no local retail space. The influx of very tall as-of-right buildings along the eastern avenues (Third through York, inclusive) strains the infrastructure and municipal services, reduces access to light and air, and threatens the character of the surrounding mid-blocks. The Board initiated and continues to vigorously advocate for the establishment of two Zoning Special Districts (Lenox Hill and Yorkville).  Their features will include a height limit of 210 feet for buildings on York, First, Second, and Third Avenues. At the heart of the proposed Special Districts is the preservation of existing affordable housing and existing small-scale local retail in existing tenement buildings along the avenues in question. CB8M and local civic groups have urged the Department of City Planning to review the Community Facility provisions of the Zoning Resolution. CD8M is the only district where community facilities are entitled to a 5.1 FAR in the R8-B mid-blocks. CB8M has proposed to the Department of City Planning modifications to the Zoning Resolution to change the current community facility bulk regulations in R8-B areas from a 5.1 to a 4.0 FAR. Current C1 and C2 zoning (Local Retail Use) theoretically controls commercial signage in the district, but enforcement is lax. Roosevelt Island is undergoing major change with the addition of the Cornell Tech graduate center. The campus will occupy most of the southern part of the island. While the graduate center benefits the community and city, the quality of life of the residents must be protected while the island undergoes major construction for years to come. ","Community District 8 has a larger percentage of renters (37.5%) compared to rest of Manhattan (23%) and New York City (32%).  Residents of Community District 8 pay more for rent than the rest of Manhattan and New York, indeed, median rent in CD8 was $2,480/month in 2019, the 3rd highest of all community districts in New York City - $1,380/month.  Conversely, median ""asking rent"" in Community District 8 was lower ($2,799) than in Manhattan ($3,195) or the City ($2,800).  However, the difference between ""asking rents"" and ""median rents"" was closer in Community District 8 ($509) than the rest of Manhattan ($1,505) or New York City ($1,420).  The percentage of rent-burdened residents (i.e., paying more than 30% of income for rent) was lower in Community District 8 (41.5%) than either Manhattan (45.9%) or New York City (53.5%) - although 19.5% of the district's residents were paying over 50% of their income on rent.  The district also has a smaller share of affordable units to low-income households than Manhattan or the City.  Specifically, 12.5% of available units were affordable to households earning 80% of AMI, 4.7% for households earning 50% of AMI and 2.1% for households at 30% of AMI.  In terms of rent regulated units, Community District 8 has a smaller share (33%) of units than Manhattan (44%) or the City (45%).  Community District 8 has a higher median income ($119,261) than Manhattan ($79,077) or the City ($60,008) and a lower share of ""low-income"" (below 80% AMI) residents (27%) than Manhattan (47%) or the City (61%).  The District also has a smaller share of residents living in poverty (6.5%) than Manhattan (17.3%) or New York City (18.9%).  It does however, have a larger share of seniors (18.1%) than Manhattan (14.9%) or the City as a whole (13.5%).  Overall, the district offers disproportionately few housing opportunities for low-income New Yorkers and needs much more affordable housing developments to meet the City's affordable housing need and fair housing obligations. As new market rate developments proliferate in the aftermath of the completion of the Second Avenue Subway, the District's senior and fixed income residents face ever-challenging conditions in which to find affordable housing.  Needs for NYCHA Housing: There are three NYCHA developments located in Community Board 8: Holmes Towers, Isaacs Houses and Robbins Plaza.  Together these developments contain over 1300 residential housing units. In the past year (August 2022 over August 2021) the number of open work orders at Isaacs Houses increased by 30% to 2,000; at Holmes Towers the number of open work orders increased 44% to 1,590; and at Robbins Plaza the number of open work orders is up 60% to 341.  On average it takes NYCHA 319 days to complete repairs up from 282 days during the same period in 2021. All three developments need timely repairs to apartments, heat and hot water systems, and elevators.  In addition, increased extermination is needed to address infestations of mice and roaches in certain dwellings due to the lack of repairs from water damage in the bathrooms and kitchens.   At Holmes Towers and Isaacs Houses there is a need for a children and adolescent after school program.  There is also a need for youth activities in the evenings for our children to thrive, maintain good grades and stay out of trouble.  There should be trainings offered directly to the young people of these two developments.  Working parents and non-working parents should be able to have their children in an afterschool program.  Our older youth should be able to utilize our community centers for activities such as learning, tutoring, arts, crafts, drama, dance, chess and so forth.  A strong community invests in its own.     ","CB8M works with the Madison Avenue Business Improvement District, the East Midtown Partnership and the DOE Fund on a range of issues. CB8M's efforts on traffic and quality of life are critical to our local businesses. We support city programs that promote the retention and growth of local businesses.

The transportation network serving Community District 8 should be resilient, safe, convenient and reliable for all users, including persons who commute on foot, by bus, subway, car, bike, or other mode. The implementation of congestion pricing must be done in such a way as to minimize the detrimental impacts on New Yorkers living within and outside the congestion zone.  ","Though congestion disappeared for a brief time during 2020 as Covid-19 peaked in New York City, it has recovered to levels comparable to pre-pandemic years, with peak travel times now being more evenly distributed throughout each day creating longer periods of congestion. There is also higher vehicle ownership in Community District 8 as a result of Covid-19, and more reliance on e-commerce that has resulted in more competition for street space; this has also had a detrimental impact on congestion  caused by double parking, truck unloading and warehousing activities that illegally take place in moving lanes, parking lanes and on sidewalks, and increased presence of bicycles, mopeds, and scooters. Given these changes, and the yet-to-be-determined impacts that may occur upon the start of central business district tolling, the need for the a proposed comprehensive study of York Avenue traffic operations between 59th Street and 79th Street that includes cross streets that impact York Avenue's traffic conditions is critical and should be carried out as soon as possible. Other ancillary traffic studies to prepare our district for any shifts in traffic that congestion pricing may produce are also needed.    Manhattan has consistently ranked funding for street repair and maintenance high on its list of priorities, and we applaud the NYC Department of Transportation's Manhattan Highway Maintenance Division on the job they do managing this substantial task. Continued swift and proactive attention to maintenance needs such as regular resurfacing of roadways and filling potholes are especially critical. With more extreme weather events occurring with increased regularity, it is crucial that NYCDOT proactively address any road and sidewalk deficiencies that excessive heat, rain and snow can exacerbate, and improve road permeability wherever possible.    Safety continues to be is a major concern across all modes of transportation. Vision zero initiatives have made streets safer, but additional action is needed to further improve safety and reduce interactions between cars, cyclists mopeds, other types of motorized transportation and pedestrians. Particular attention is needed to address bike safety, as biking has grown significantly with the introduction of bike lanes and people shifting to bike use during the pandemic. Funding to provide additional resources for traffic enforcement for both general traffic lanes and bike lanes is especially needed; funding is also needed to support NYCDOT enforcement of outdoor seating areas that emerged with the introduction of the open restaurants program that was brought upon by Covid.  ","As New York City recovers from the impacts of Covid-19 and more passengers resume their use of the transit network, MTA NYC Transit must fully restore service on subways and buses to pre-Covid levels and further increase levels that would fully reverse cuts made to the M31 and M66 bus lines that occurred in the years preceding Covid. Furthermore, New York City Transit must plan to add service ahead of the implementation of congestion pricing so that any new transit passengers can be comfortably accommodated; more service is especially needed on the Q train during peak hours and across the system during off-peak periods. Select Bus Service has had a beneficial impact on bus travel times on 1st Avenue, 79th Street and 86th Street, and Community Board 8 supports full funding of the Better Buses Action Plan that includes Select Bus Service on the M96. Community Board 8 also calls for the addition of a select bus stop on East 72nd Street at First and Second Avenues. Community Board 8 will continue to work with commuters to address ongoing bus service issues such as punctuality, bus bunching and lengthy dwell times; expanded investment in traffic cameras to enforce bus lanes can help address this issue. We support full funding of the MTA Capital Program to finance continued improvements to system infrastructure, including making all district subway stations fully accessible, maintaining a state of good repair and normal replacement, upgrading critical components such as signal systems, and improvements to address resiliency and reduce the impact that flooding events have on transit operations ","","","","","Other - Write In (Required)","","All of the above. Our community ranks 47 out of 51 in terms of open space despite being one of the densest in the entire city. As we experience the effects of climate change – including more frequent severe storm events and record heat – it is imperative that we invest in our parks and open spaces, which are vital resources to our overall resiliency and public health. Our goal is to ensure the parks in CD8 are clean, safe, and in good condition.  The Community Board is grateful to our Council Members for securing funding for the full reconstruction of Ruppert Park, including the construction of a restroom in the park as well as funding to provide an accessible entrance to the multi-purpose play area in John Jay Park and other park improvements.  This funding is essential to ensure all community members have access to our park facilities.    While Capital funding for our neighborhood parks is essential to bring the parks up to a state of good repair, expense funding is equally as critical to ensure that our parks are maintained, trees are pruned and maintained, rats are eradicated from the parks, and our parks are clean and safe for the neighborhood residents.  The Parks Department suffers from constrained staffing of maintenance workers, millions of dollars in deferred maintenance, and minimal funding for recreation centers.  To that end we call on the City to fund the Parks Department at 1 percent of the City’s operating budget – today it is only 0.6 percent.  The additional funding will optimize parks maintenance for cleaner parks, preserve and grow the tree canopy, and provide improved safety and support to manage compliance with park rules.  Funding for Community Boards – Additional funding is needed to adequately fund community board budgets. It is essential that we have sufficient funding to pay our staff members the salaries that they deserve, particularly as reliance on staff will increase when community board term limits come into effect. Community boards also need additional funding for other operational expenses. Since the pandemic — and with state legislative initiatives proposing permanent hybrid meetings for community boards — our operational costs have increased, as well as the number of hours our staff has to work as a result of additional responsibilities. Community boards are an essential part of city government, and we request they be adequately funded so that we can retain our staff and maintain the necessary services for our community members.","Our community ranks 47 out of 51 in terms of open space despite being one of the densest in the entire city.

This funding is essential to ensure all community members have access to our park facilities.    Additional capital funding is required for the following projects:  The Parks Department has scraped together funding to make some critical repairs to John Jay Park but has left several key repairs open due to a lack of capital resources.  Additional funding is needed in John Jay Park to repair the handball courts and address the constant drainage issues in the children's playground.  While our Council Members have provided funding for the reconstruction of Ruppert Park and the installation of a restroom in the park, the project still has not moved forward and the reconstruction of the park and the restroom are moving forward on separate tracks and by different agencies.  We urge the city to clear the bureaucratic hurdles and accelerate and coordinate these critical projects. Each day the projects are delayed, construction and material costs increase.   We call on the city to provide funding for repairs to the East River Esplanade between 77th and 80th Streets.  While some funding has been provided, and the sinkhole was repaired once before, we urge the city to fund and move forward with the necessary repairs to address the root cause of the problem that is causing the soil to subside and sinkholes to develop.  The bulkhead at 80th Street is also crumbling and in need of repairs.    Other parks in need of capital funding include 24 Sycamores Park, Samuel Seabury Playground, and the Stanley Isaacs Park, including improved lighting, seating, and other park repairs at Stanley Isaacs Park.  We also need funds to improve the lighting on James Cagney Place. We appreciate the funding from the New York Rangers to repair the hockey rink and hope that additional funding can be identified to repair the rest of the park.   Finally, capital funding is needed for Phase 3 of Andrew Haswell Green Park to complete the construction of this beautiful park along the East River.

We take an active role in helping the community access art to improve quality of life by working to provide art in public spaces. We support local artists and the community's interest in the visual and performing arts. Through access to the arts, more community members have become engaged with and interested in Community District 8. The Community Board supports several Art Shows.  Increased funding for the Community Board would help the Board support Art and Culture events in the community. ","For more than a century, the New York Public Library has provided quality service to all New Yorkers. The branch libraries are an important public resource for local residents, especially senior citizens and students.  The library budget must be maintained. CB8M urges the Mayor and the City Council to maintain funding for the operating costs to allow the continuation of 7 day a week service at all branches.  We also urge increased funding for infrastructure, technological improvements and library materials, particularly increased funding for books, periodicals, and other information resources in all our branch libraries.  Funding should be found to allow libraries to operate at full hours (i.e. 10-5 Monday through Sunday) and expanded evening hours at least twice a week.  As sources of information have evolved, the Library has kept pace, offering one of the only free points of access to the internet in New York City.

Our district runs from 110th Street to 155th Street. Our Eastern border runs along Manhattan/Morningside Aves, St. Nicholas/Edgecombe and Bradhurst Aves and the Hudson River is our western border. Each neighborhood is a distinct community, but all face growing challenges of housing affordability, increased homelessness, and a lack of youth development and employment opportunities. The biggest issue facing our neighborhood is affordability, particularly the rapid loss of previously-existing rent-stabilized apartments that are affordable to our largely lower-income and working class community. The coronavirus has taken a heavy toll on our community both in terms of cases and deaths, in the economic devastation from businesses closed and jobs lost, and in terms of education interrupted by remote learning that remained inaccessible to many families lacking digital connections or tech skills to troubleshoot issues. Because the demographics of our neighborhoods include many intersections of vulnerable populations (frontline workers, low-income, heavily Black and Latino, many seniors, and high rates of pre-existing conditions like heart disease), our neighborhoods continue to require sustained and aggressive programming for vaccination, testing and tracing, PPE distribution, and anti-hunger initiatives. After being ignored by the City in the initial vaccination rollout in the winter and spring of 2021 (with no City-run vaccination sites in our district until City College was selected at the end of March), our vaccination rates in fall 2022 continue to lag those of Manhattan and the city as a whole. ZIP code 10027 has only 73.4% of the population having completed a primary vaccination series while 10031 has only 73.2%, compared with a 79.9% fully vaccinated rate citywide and a 85% fully vaccinated rate in Manhattan. General Grant Houses had the most deaths of any NYCHA development in the city during the first wave of cases this spring, and Manhattanville Houses had a similarly high death toll during the second wave in the fall and winter of 2020. Even prior to the pandemic, our neighborhoods' poverty rate of 24.1% was significantly higher than the city's overall rate of 17.2%, with poverty concentrated among both families with young children (31.4% of whom were in households below the poverty line) and the elderly (26.7% of whom lived below the poverty line). Even when looking at a cutoff of 200% of the federal poverty line, our neighborhoods collectively had 43.3% of households below that limit compared to the citywide rate of 34.6% Due to the concentration of residents who held service jobs in the hospitality industry (cooks, servers, bartenders, hotel and facilities workers) and employment in the arts collectively making up 15.8% of the population as of 2018 compared to the citywide average of 10.2%, unemployment in our ZIP codes soared, hitting 17.69% in 10031, 19.31% in 10027, and 6.68% in 10025 (shared with MCD7), before returning to lower levels (though still elevated above the NYC average) this year. And as work, school, and social life began ""going remote,"" families and individuals in our community were at a disadvantage, with 7.1% of households only having internet on their cellular devices and 13.7% of households lacking an internet connection entirely as of 2019 ACS data. In order to recover from the pandemic, our neighborhood will require sustained support for our most vulnerable, including but not limited to the following interventions:   	Income assistance 	Job placement and training workforce development, particularly in high-growth fields not requiring a college degree like the construction trades, life sciences, and skilled building maintenance 	Subsidized or free internet connections 	Digital literacy programs 	Small business support 	Assistance to renters 	Assistance to homeowners, especially with repairs and capital expenses as well as lower interest rates and more flexible plans for water/sewage arrears and property tax arrears.   Immediate expenditures by agencies, aside from rent assistance, include further technological assistance to families in DOE schools who have difficulty participating in remote learning, an expansion of the Cure Violence program to cover the southern portion of Hamilton Heights where there has been an alarming escalation in the number of shootings, increased resources for homelessness outreach and services, especially around Montefiore Park on Broadway and W 136th to W 138th Streets, and expansion of regular DSNY curb basket collection and education and enforcement to help control pest populations. All of these are included in our budget priorities. Longer-term trends continue to threaten our vibrancy as a diverse, mixed-income community. From 2000 to 2019, the Black population of MCD9 declined from 29.1% to 15.2%; the Hispanic population of MCD9 declined from 42.7% to 37%; and the white population of MCD9 grew from 20.3% to 35.7%. During the same timeframe, households earning less than $60,000 annually declined from 59.4% to 51.6%; households earning between $60,000 to $250,000 grew from 36.6% to 41.1%; and households earning more than $250,000 grew from 4% to 7.4%. These trends, accompanied by persistently high eviction rates and a rise in the percentage of rent-burdened households, were caused by aggressive gentrification marked by residential and commercial displacement of working-class and low-income households in favor of younger, whiter, more highly-educated and higher-income, but more transient students and recent postsecondary graduates. While we expect the improved 2019 rent regulations and the expansion of the Right to Counsel law to slow the rate of residential displacement, additional resources for proactive tenant legal representation and organizing are necessary to stabilize the neighborhood and protect our economic and racial diversity. This has become increasingly more important as Right to Counsel legal services providers are at maximum capacity and are turning away clients as of 2022. The several neighborhoods within our West Harlem boundaries face unique circumstances, even as they largely share similar challenges. Morningside Heights in the southern portion of the Board contains many of the area's numerous institutions: Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine. Bank Street College of Education, Columbia University, Barnard College, Teacher's College, Manhattan School of Music, Union Theological Seminary, Jewish Theological Seminary, The National Council of Churches, Riverside Church, Grotto of Notre Dame, and the Mount Sinai St. Luke's Hospital Center. Morningside Heights itself is an extremely diverse area and is anchored at the northern end by the General Grant Houses NYCHA development and the former limited-equity cooperative Morningside Gardens. Real estate in Morningside Heights is overwhelmingly owned by the aforementioned institutions, with the remaining parcels generally belonging to private co-ops, with a small cluster of rent-stabilized, non-institutionally-owned rental buildings in the northwest area of the neighborhood around Tiemann Place, La Salle Street, and Claremont Avenue. Morningside Heights has recently been the site of battles fought with institutions selling property to developers who then build luxury condominium or rental towers ""as of right"" that are out of context with no height limits under current zoning.  A grassroots movement has erupted to complete the over thirty year old battle to undertake a study to rezone the area of Morningside Heights and put limits on the height and context of buildings in this portion of the district. To the north of Morningside Heights is Manhattanville, which begins at roughly 123rd Street and extends northward to 135th Street. This area includes the south campus of the City College, part of the City University of New York; the Manhattanville Houses NYCHA development; Riverside Park Community Housing at 3333 Broadway, (a former Mitchell-Lama rental building), and a number of small commercial establishments. Manhattanville is also the site of Columbia University's new campus, which is currently under construction in an area formerly inhabited by light manufacturing businesses that served as a middle-class employment base for many working families in the area. The departure of those manufacturing jobs has left the district with a dearth of stable jobs with decent pay that do not require a college degree. Manhattanville is also home to the District's largest concentration of non-institutional commercial office space in the Manhattanville Factory District, comprising an area east of Amsterdam Avenue and west of Convent Avenue between W 125th and W 130th Streets. The northernmost section of Community Board No. 9 is comprised of Hamilton Heights (which includes the ""Hamilton Heights/Sugar Hill Historic District"". Hamilton Heights is home to a substantial number of owner- occupied brownstones and also includes the Audubon Houses NYCHA development, Riverview Tower/626 Riverside Drive (a Mitchell-Lama co-operative), and the largest number of Housing Development Fund Cooperatives (limited-income cooperatives where purchasers must make under a certain amount of income per year at the time they buy the apartment) in the city. There are very few vacant structures or lots. The majority of the small businesses in this area are operated by a diverse group, including Hispanic/Latino, Middle Eastern, Caribbean, and Asian owner/operators. Hamilton Heights is also home to the North River Pollution Control Plant with the Riverbank State Park on its roof. Hamilton Heights and Manhattanville also abut St. Nicholas Park, the site of the Alexander Hamilton House. The unique topography and history of these areas, partially separated from the rest of Upper Manhattan by a series of bluffs on its eastern end (Jackie Robinson Park, St. Nicholas Park, and Morningside Park) helps to create an eclectic and historic area with its own distinct character.  The topography and our adjacency to the Hudson River means that we are blessed with a series of parks that serve as collective outdoor living rooms, play spaces, athletic facilities, and gathering places that have helped enormously during the pandemic. Their maintenance in a state of good repair is a critical priority for our community, but several, especially St. Nicholas Park, require extensive reconstruction of their pathways. We are proud of our neighborhoods and are committed to maintaining them and ensuring that our neighbors will be afforded an excellent quality of life.  ","","","","","Affordable Housing","","Manhattan Community Board No. 9 (MCB9) biggest concern is residential displacement caused by significant post-pandemic rent increases, gentrification in general and pressure by neighboring educational institutions, lack of maintenance by both private owners and HPD, in addition to the years of uncertainty for those in the Tenant Interim Lease program. Those concerns are magnified by the general and acute need for new affordable housing for low, medium and middle-income families.   A significant portion of MCB9 renter households is under a financial burden to pay rent. Technically, this includes households who have to use 30% or more of their income towards rent. Census data from 2021 shows 20% of all CB9 households were “moderately rent-burdened”, paying 30% or more of their income towards rent. Even worse, an additional 31% of CB9 households are “Severely rent-burdened”, paying 50% or more of their income on rent. Among our low-income population this number increases to 47% of households. In total, 51% of households in MCB9 are severely or moderately rent-burdened. In July 2023, the real estate publication Zumper published its ""National Rent Report"" noting the median rent for a one-bedroom in West Harlem was $2,823. For a new renter to afford a one-bedroom today, their median household income would need to be at least $120,000 to avoid being rent burdened. This income is twice the median household income for MCB9, which is $57,000. This is a staggering disparity between what current residents of MCB9 can afford and what those coming in can expect to pay. This puts added pressure on the housing stock for both renters and owners.  In addition, the expiration of public subsidy contracts for affordable housing and rapid private development of the few remaining soft sites in the district, long-term residents of public and rent-regulated and subsidized housing face the threat of displacement. Riverside Park Community (3333 Broadway) is a recent example of a lost Mitchell Lama property with over 2,000 apartments; we encourage the City to take all steps necessary to protect NYCHA, HPD, and Mitchell-Lama properties from privatization. The privatization of the properties would render many residents homeless. Capital funding for repairs at Audubon and Manhattanville Houses is currently in process through RAD/PACT. Community Board 9 has serious concerns about the long-term impact of these programs on tenants' stability and their apartments' habitability, and close monitoring of contractors and communication with residents will be essential to ensuring that the proper scope of work for these developments is selected and the true extent of necessary repairs is understood and fully funded.  MCB9 is also home to many buildings still in the Tenant Interim Lease program. Tenants in these City-owned buildings gave up their rent regulated leases in exchange for a commitment from the city to repair the buildings and sell the apartments to the tenants for $250. The City must fulfill its commitment to these tenants by repairing and restoring these buildings to habitability and then allowing the tenants to become shareholders without having the building shoulder an enormous debt burden, as is the case with the Affordable Neighborhood Cooperative Program (which requires millions of dollars of debt be attached to the newly-formed HDFC Co-op). Fully funding repairs and co-op conversions in TIL buildings and former TIL buildings without leaving the resulting co-ops with loans is a top priority that will require the restoration of City capital funds to a dedicated TIL program budget line. Additional investments in low-income housing, especially supportive housing for the formerly homeless (with a local preference for those formerly housed in Manhattan Community District 9) is also desperately needed.  Finally, additional enforcement of housing code violations in landlord-owned rental buildings and tenant education will be crucial to addressing affordable housing and habitability issues. There are currently 12,065 open Class C (Immediately Hazardous) Housing Maintenance Code violations open in MCD9 (up 10% over previous year) and 28,760 Class B (Hazardous) violations open in MCD9 (up 5% over previous year), ranking 15th highest among all Community Boards in New York City and 3rd highest in Manhattan. These are some of the highest rates in the city, and contain numerous issues with mold, lead paint and dust, mice and other vermin infestations, and fire hazards. The Tenant Protection Unit and HPD Enforcement both should increase activity in the district using 311 data and DOB violation data. Additional enforcement actions must also be undertaken to crack down on landlords who are increasingly seeking to illegally rent out individual rooms as either short-term (frequently through AirBnB) or long-term rentals, in what should be rent-stabilized apartments, functionally creating illegal SROs.","Health care services","","Manhattan Community District 9 faces a multitude of increased risk factors relative to the rest of the city that require increased health interventions. Air quality is relatively poor, especially in the Manhattanville area, due to high concentrations of building boilers, industrial and commercial buildings, and truck traffic, with elevated level of nitrogen dioxide and PM 2.5 (8.0 in MCD9 vs. 7.5 citywide). Fewer households in MCD9 have air conditioning (86% compared to 89% citywide), with more relying on open windows for circulation and cooling during the summer. Our maternal care and infant mortality rates are a cause for special concern, with 11% of delivering mothers in MCD9 having late or no prenatal care (compared to 6.7% citywide) and an infant mortality rate of 4.5 per 1,000 live births, roughly that of Serbia. Childhood obesity rates of 25% are also elevated relative to citywide rates of 20%, and ER visits for childhood asthma emergencies are at 333 per 10,000, over a third higher than the citywide rate of 223 per 10,000. Significantly higher rates of diabetes (10%) and hypertension (29%) also lead to significantly higher rates of stroke and cardiac events 31.7% of premature deaths. High rates of psychiatric hospitalization (726 per 100,000 adults) are likely due to greater stressors and less access to preventative care. MCD9 also has 34.1 new HIV diagnoses per 100,000 people, a third higher than the citywide average, suggesting greater interventions in intravenous drug using populations and more access to treatment as prevention strategies are needed. Significant interventions are needed to educate community members about nutrition, diabetes care, smoking cessation, and asthma care. More air quality monitoring and community and school exercise programming is needed. Increased investments in chronic disease management, including free or low-cost access to medication and care, is required. The Manhattanville Health Station at 21 Old Broadway should be utilized as a hub for these services.","Schools","","One of the biggest issues in MCD9 is school overcrowding and poor school facilities, despite what the Blue Book may say about particular school districts. Manhattan Community District 9 contains 29 K-12 school facilities, both public and private, although this is expected to drop to 28 with the closure of Corpus Christi school. Educational attainment in the district is highly unequal, with higher rates of both those having graduate degrees (22%) and bachelor's degrees (21.9%) than the citywide averages, but also higher rates of those having less than a 9th grade education (11%) and having left school between 9th and 12th grades (9%). Our schools have higher languages of English Language Learners than citywide and many are Title I schools with some having over 85% economic need index according to DOE data. Our reading proficiency levels are routinely below 40%. Chronic absenteeism is significantly higher in MCD9 (27%, compared to 20% citywide), graduation rates stand at only 65% vs. 75% citywide, and many families have members incarcerated, with our rate of incarceration at 633 per 100,000, compared to 425 per 100,000 citywide. The growing number of disengaged youth who are not in after-school enrichment or employment programs have led to a notable increase in recruitment of young teens (13-15) into gangs and drug dealing, particularly in the southern area of Hamilton Heights (135th to 140th Streets). With many school operating at least partially remotely, the increase in disconnected youth has risen even more. More interventions and programs assisting young people with issues including mental health, social and skills development, and mentorship are needed. Additionally, a Cure Violence program expansion into said area of Hamilton Heights is also required to help intervene in and prevent additional shooting incidents, which have skyrocketed over the past 2 years.  MS 371 SEED school (05M371), PS/MS 129 John Finley School (05M129), and others are asking the DOE for technology improvements so that students can meet the demands of the twenty-first century. Curriculums include STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics), but schools lack the tools to implement these programs. Technology can be used to support and enhance student’s other academic studies such as Art, Science Exploration, Math Illustration and more. The worldwide industry trends require computer literacy. It is essential that schools have the technology infrastructure, including high-speed internet bandwidth, to support laptop/tablet use in classrooms. The DOE has an obligation to provide students with a skillset that will allow for entrance into higher education and into the job market.  This also requires the DOE to provide and staff additional IT personnel to regularly update computers and computer accessories. Additionally, we ask the DOE to provide space for teachers and parents to learn basic computer skills. Schools have the capacity to host after-school or preschool computer lessons so that the adults in our students’ lives have basic computer literacy. Learning continues at home, and parents need to be able to help their children navigate Google classroom, IXL or any other programs their students may be using at the end of their school day. MCB9 needs adequate wireless Internet and computer technology access in schools and in students’ homes which will increase diversity and support our most vulnerable students. While NYC has taken steps by providing complimentary wifi with the LinkNYC stands; we ask that the NYC Office of Technology and Innovation (NYC OTI) take it a step further by providing wireless routers and establishing city wide internet access. The New York Public Library (NYPL) can assist with accomplishing this by having adequate hours and staffing. We request funds to continue to extend access to the New York Public Library (NYPL) branches in the community. For in-person Access: six-day service including increased hours, programming, collections, and sufficient staff to support these functions. For remote access: increasing the number of available Wi-Fi hotspots available across our West Harlem library branches for community members to borrow. These will provide greater access to digital library content, as well as other critical digital resources, collections, and sufficient staff to support these functions. Public Libraries provide our community with substantial educational support, not only for current K-12 students but also for parents, families with young children, English language learners, job seekers, and more. Libraries provide access to reading material, technology equipment, and educational programs (homework help, literacy programs, etc.). Libraries also provide a safe space for children to gather after school, where they can study, play computer games together and relax.   Finally, in addition to a need for wraparound school-based services and technology upgrades, the absolutely most pressing issue facing education in CB9 is the severe overcrowding in certain schools, most notably at 433 W 123rd Street/425 W 123rd Street, which houses PS 125 (Ralph Bunche), M362 (Columbia Secondary School for Math, Science, and Engineering, or ""CSS""), and a Kipp STAR College Prep Charter School. These 3 schools are colocated in a building originally developed for elementary school children, but cover children ages 4 years old through 19 years old. The facility unlawfully lacks library services, has IEP activities conducted in closets, children changing for gym in stairwells, and inadequate cafeteria facilities that means children are eating lunch in shifts from 10am through 3pm. This is completely unacceptable, and the inane response we routinely receive when we raise the issue, that ""District 5 does not have an assessed need for additional capacity at this time,"" does not address the unlawfully crowded and inadequate conditions for these schools. The current situation opens the City and the DOE up to unacceptable risk of litigation and must be met with plans and funding to expand the physical facilities available to these schools.","","","","","Health code enforcement","","Explanation","New York City Department of Health launched TAKE CARE NEW YORK 2020 which provides a health profile for every community board in New York City. As a result, the community boards have a statistically driven idea of what our health issues are in comparison to the rest of the city. MANHATTAN COMMUNITY BOARD 9 (MCB9) ranked 10th in the City for people who are returning home from incarceration. MCB9 ranked in the top twenty-five percent for people who suffer from diabetes and obesity, ranked third in the city for people who needed Medical Care but went without. MCB9 currently has the highest childhood asthma rate in NYC as a whole and Manhattan. Solutions: Fund Reentry programs that have a holistic approach to assist people returning into the community; Fund programs geared toward obesity prevention by reaching out to community groups with programs; Fund outreach to people who have no insurance by going to unemployment offices, welfare offices, and food drives; Fund outreach to schools to provide asthma education training to caregivers in the school; MCB9 has a deficit of health care providers within the community. There needs to be more community-based providers and primary care physicians, MCB9 currently has very few; with Mt. Sinai West being the only Hospital in our district. There should be funding for health care offices on the street level that is accessible to everyone, those with insurance and without. MCB9 is in need of having the Manhattanville Health Station reopened at full capacity. For almost a decade, Manhattanville Health Station remains closed and there has been no clear plan presented as to when we can expect to see the center rehabilitated. Programs originally on site have been relocated to other facilities and areas leaving a major gap in services for this area. Manhattan Community District 9 faces a multitude of increased risk factors relative to the rest of the city that require increased health interventions. Air quality is relatively poor, especially in the Manhattanville area, due to high concentrations of building boilers, industrial and commercial buildings, and truck traffic, with elevated level of nitrogen dioxide and PM 2.5 (8.0 in MCD9 vs. 7.5 citywide).

More air quality monitoring and community and school exercise programming is needed. ","2020 has taught us that our greatest weakness when it comes to meeting the needs of seniors is communication.  Our committee was able to meet throughout the year, notwithstanding the shutdown, but our main means of communication was by phone, mail or in person.  We discovered that the Department for the Aging only has access to the contact information for seniors who are members of a city-run Senior Center, limiting its ability to reach seniors in need.   Our experience has shown that a number of our agencies still do not recognize the need for alternative means of communicating with seniors.  Communications come in the form of flyers with zoom links, websites and emails, failing to include a phone number for phone-accessible information.  During the citywide shutdown, seniors were not receiving up-to-date information about where to get vaccinated, where to get food, or how to receive other forms of assistance, unless they were signed up at their local senior center or otherwise actively engaged through the Community Board or another organization.    Our committee sees communication as a gateway to improving many other aspects of seniors' lives.  When seniors are empowered to communicate their needs, they will be able to address everything from health to transportation, arts to accessibility.  And experience shows us that when things improve for seniors, they improve for every member of society.       Given that the amount of funding the Department for the Aging has received from the city has historically been less than half of a percentage of the City's budget (https://local.aarp.org/news/aarp-commends-nyc-council-mayor-for-increased-funding-for-aging-services-in-fy22-calls-for-longterm-future-investment-ny-2021-07-01.html)  we applaud the city and our Mayor for making the largest investments in DFTA's budget to date and restoring almost all the City Council's Senior Service initiatives to pre-pandemic funding levels.  Seniors now represent roughly 20% of the city's population as a whole and they deserve a greater share of the budget.  However, the gaps in communication between city agencies and seniors will not be addressed with this funding alone.  Therefore, we recommend the following:  1. $6,000,000 dedicated to the purchase and distribution of tablets to all seniors.  During the pandemic, the city spent almost 300 million dollars in order to provide schoolchildren with tablets so that they could continue to attend school virtually.  Schoolchildren represent less than 20% of the city's population.  2. $6,000,000 dedicated to technology training for seniors.  Most seniors will need help learning how to use this new technology so it is essential that we pair training and technology   3. $1,000,000 annually, dedicated to training staff at all agencies on how to communicate with seniors.    Agencies continue to communicate using modes that are only accessible via the internet through the use of a computer or smartphone.  We must change the culture within our agencies so that seniors' needs are always taken into account.  In addition, long-range comprehensive planning must include housing, health and mental care, home care and senior centers.  Therefore, we request   	$6,000,000 to support outreach to the homebound. 	$100,000,000 to develop 200 new units of affordable housing for seniors.    ","Manhattan Community District 9 has seen an enormous rise in homelessness through tenant eviction and a lack of affordable housing, with two of the highest ZIP codes for evictions in the city (10027 and 10031). From 2017 through 2019, MCD9 saw 524 evictions, or 1 eviction for each 85.5 housing units, among the highest in the City. MCD9 has also seen a massive rise in street homelessness in 2020, with 311 reports of homeless individuals tripling from 2018 to 2020. More outreach staffing to allow daily outreach in hotspots around Montefiore Park, Jacob Schiff Park, Broadway in Morningside Heights, Convent Avenue and 126th/127th Streets east of Amsterdam Avenue, and Riverside Park in Hamilton Heights is needed. Additionally, more targeted outreach to get individuals experiencing homelessness with concurrent mental health and substance abuse disorders into appropriate treatment is necessary. ","Many of the issues faced by low-income residents in CB9 are issues that overlap with other areas like housing, education, childcare, and senior services. The dilapidated state of Manhattanville Houses, Grant Houses, and Audubon Houses, as with most NYCHA housing stock, contributes to environmental and health issues among many low-income residents. A lack of affordable childcare slots also makes it difficult for low-income families to advance economically. One particular issue that has become incredibly prominent during the pandemic and will continue to grow in importance as inflation raises prices on the grocery store shelves is food insecurity. Map the Meal Gap shows food insecurity in our area was elevated even prior to the pandemic at ~17% of households being food insecure. Contineud efforts to stock local pantries and work with local community based organizations like churches and housing rights organizations is critical to helping fill that gap, along with increased meals programs at schools and senior centers. ","","","","","School and educational facilities (Capacity)","","Explanation","MCB9 is in need of adequate physical space for existing schools in light of the co-location of many DOE and charter schools in DOE buildings.  Each time an example of overcrowding is given, the blue book is heralded as confirming that there is more than enough space, creating a distinct difference between fiction and reality. Co-locations continue to pose academic, social, and physical difficulties, additionally they are hazardous and dangerous. The sheer volume of students in hallways at a given time, lack of proper changing areas for gym, and absurd lunch times are just a few reasons why the DOE has a requirement to visit schools in person and re-evaluate the space allocations. Many of these infractions are not just inconvenient, but unlawful as well.  Colocation limits the physical space that is available for schools to use for physical education and play space (gyms), arts programming (required arts curricula: music, dance, visual arts, theatre), and adequate provision of special education services as required by law. Relatedly, many buildings are serving a different age range than they were originally designed for, so facilities like desks and bathrooms are inappropriate for the physical needs of current students. We ask that the DOE provide a proper school location for School 05M362 (Columbia Secondary School, or ""CSS"") and PS 125 (Ralph Bunche School). Both schools state that more space would assist with learning above all else. Their space houses 4-year-olds up to 18 year-olds and is staggeringly inept to handle the physical challenges that this presents. CSS is a high school currently co-located with TWO other schools, PS 125 and Kipp STAR College Prep, and has a myriad of physical building issues such as mold, inadequate changing space, inadequate eating areas. There are holes in the ceilings and raccoons and birds invading the school space - this puts our children's lives in jeopardy. Furthermore - the school is not upholding the law in regards to having a separate, but safe space for IEP students to have private sessions, and to take exams. There should also be separate space for Sex Education discussions for High Schoolers. Students are in large closets for some activities and are subjected to health issues as the school does not have enough room for all students to eat lunch with adequate eating time. Children have to eat lunch at 10 am and continue lunch sessions until 3 pm without a break. The blue book is outdated and does not account for how to schedule students in such an environment where again, there are THREE separate schools using the space. This school houses students from Districts 3, 4, 5, and 6 and has been a marvel - however, the school cannot continue to operate crippled by the parameters of the blue book which does not take into consideration the different needs of elementary-aged children (from the other school in the building) being housed and educated with high school children. The student's immediate needs are not being met adequately and we request a major part of the budget for the development of physical space for this school. We have continually asked that the DOE approve the agreed upon space that Columbia Secondary School was supposed to have from its inception and allow Ralph Bunche School to expand their potential with a special education coordinator, extracurricular activities, a music room and music teacher, Library for its students and full use of the gymnasium for sports, and exercise.  MCB9 also needs adequate wireless Internet and computer technology access in schools and in students' homes, so that students can learn to use these important twenty-first-century tools and so that they can use them to support and enhance their other academic studies. Especially with curricular changes emphasizing STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) and computer science for all, it is essential that schools have the technology infrastructure, including high-speed internet bandwidth, to support laptop/tablet use in classrooms. It is important to have enough personnel to support all schools with installing, updating, and configuring these devices.  MCB9 continues to be concerned about the possibility of the presence of lead in school water fountains. We are not satisfied with the city's level of testing or communication with families about the extent of the problem or possible risks. We request funding for continued water testing and mitigation.  In Addition having a special needs program, year-round, within the borderlines of MCB9 is crucial to the development of our community. The special needs population is significant and growing. Yet there aren't many local programs out there. Most therapists and behavioral counselors only accept Medicaid or out of pocket payments. There is a growing number of working-class families that make too much to qualify for free programs or too little to afford specialty special needs care within MCB9.  We request funds to continue to extend access to the New York Public Library (NYPL) branches in the community. For in-person Access: six-day service including increased hours, programming, collections, and sufficient staff to support these functions. For remote access: increasing the number of available Wi-Fi hotspots available across our West Harlem library branches for community members to borrow. These will provide greater access to digital library content, as well as other critical digital resources, collections, and sufficient staff to support these functions.  We are also requesting that the DOE provide funding for the development of a culturally sensitive curriculum, for use within CD9 schools in cooperation with the Community Education Councils for Districts 5, and 6 recognizing the historical contributions of figures, movements, and more from a diverse set of communities within CD9, including African American, Caribbean, Latino, and LGBTQ communities.

Expanded use of social workers, substance abuse counselors, and mental health specialists in emergency response services is needed to address these issues and convince those affected to enter into the appropriate treatment programs in a way that limits involvement of the criminal justice system. In particular, expansion of the B-HEARD program to be 24 hours a day instead of only from 9am to 1am, would be an improvement.","The Police Department has the Neighborhood Coordination Officers, or NCOs, who are our local problem solvers.

","","","","","Air quality and pollution","","The aforementioned high rates of NOx, PM 2.5, and asthma all drive negative health consequences throughout CB9. Ensuring that the North River Wastewater Treatment Plant is not contributing to the air quality conditions in the district will require continued investment in air quality monitoring.

We urge the City to increase staffing to facilitate three pickups per day in these locations. There is a need for more garbage cans due to the rat infestation. For Vacant Lots and trouble locations, we need the Clean Team Restored. Recycling figures have greatly improved. We need, if not increased, consistent Sanitation Enforcement in our area, MCB9 has recommended an increase of Enforcement Officers in the afternoon when violations are at their peak.

[1] MCB9 proudly benefits from a long and rich tradition of historic preservation and tenant empowerment. As a result of these positions, much of the building stock in the community was not demolished in the 1970s or 1980s when landlords were abandoning the area, but instead most became limited-income HDFC cooperatives, while the remaining usually became non-profit owned affordable rentals. To this day, CB9 has the highest concentration of HDFC co-operatives in the City. As a result of this emphasis on preservation and tenant self-determination, there were relatively few vacant lots and soft sites in the neighborhoods. To this end, MCB9 and the West Harlem community worked over the course of many years to work with the Department of City Planning to rezone the district. The goals of which included:       	 	To preserve the strongly-established and varied character of the West Harlem residential neighborhoods; 	 	 	Consider opportunities for new mixed-use development in the existing manufacturing district, located between West 126th and West 130th streets, bound by Amsterdam and Convent avenues. 	 	 	Explore the community's east-west corridors to allow for development opportunities, where appropriate, while utilizing the Inclusionary Housing Program to promote affordable housing. 	      Based on these goals, MCB9's highest land use priority is to respect the goals and findings of the 2012 rezoning. This includes rejecting out-of-scale developments in areas the City and community agreed to down-zone such as on West 142nd Street and continuing to push and encourage development opportunities in the district's east-west corridors. MCB9's recent resolution calling for increased affordable housing at 1727 Amsterdam is one such example of these goals.  [2] In the southern end of the district, DCP rejected a rezoning in Morningside Heights, which is unique in the overwhelming dominance of institutional owners whose building uses are frequently categorized as community facility space. The ability to agglomerate large assemblages of lots, the exemption to the New York State rent regulations that allow these institutions to remove housing units from rent regulation at the end of a tenancy, and the sky plane exposure-based 1960s zoning in the neighborhood means that Morningside Heights is uniquely vulnerable to unchecked, out-of-context luxury condominium development. MCB9 is likewise focused on rezoning Morningside Heights with height-based zoning designations while upzoning the remaining potential development sites so that Mandatory Inclusionary Housing applies and affordable housing is required in any new development.  ","   50% of households in Manhattan Community Board No. 9 (MCB9) are rent-burdened: 31% pay more than 50% of their income in rent, and 20% pay between 30% and 49% of their income in rent. Additionally, there are an estimated ~56,000 open housing violations in MCD9, of which ~13,000 are Class C immediately hazardous violations, and ~29,000 are Class B hazardous violations. The overwhelming majority of these violations (~10,000 of Class C, ~21,000 of Class B) occur in the Hamilton Heights/Sugar Hill area, with the rest (~2,300 of Class C, ~5,000 of Class B) mostly in Manhattanville. To address this crisis, MCB9 seeks to preserve and create affordable housing of various types--NYCHA, rent stabilized, rent controlled, coops/condominiums, HDFCs, TILs and 1-4 family townhouses. Additionally, enforcement of housing code violations and mandated repairs in rental units must be significantly increased, along with coordination with local nonprofits and the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal to secure the appropriate rent abatements and reductions for tenants due to the loss of services reflected in the violations. From 2007-2021, we estimate that MCD9 suffered a net loss of 2,200+ rent regulated units of our stock of 16,932 units regulated at the start of 2007.  MCB9 has also seen an increase in vacancy rate of rentals from 3.1% in 2019 to 5.4% in 2021 with many rent-stabilized units being kept vacant for more than a year. This is a concerning trend by landlords to deliberately refuse to rent out apartments which allow many residents to live in the MCB9 that otherwise would not be able to.       We ask that DOF conduct audits of any property owners who have reported a reduction of rent regulated units while in receipt of a tax abatement like 421a or J-51 which does not permit deregulation of units in the building. We also seek to have community input in development projects big and small--particularly any plans for ""soft"" development sites. Having a designated planner available to the HLUZ committee and the board, in general, would help greatly in this regard. Because CB9 has the largest concentration of HDFC cooperatives in New York State, funding for low-interest loans for capital repairs to these buildings and other low-income homeowners, as well as tax abatements and technical assistance, are a very high priority. Additionally, the three NYCHA complexes in CB9 (Manhattanville Houses and Rehabs, General Grant Houses, and Audubon Houses) are is desperate need of capital repairs, with Audubon Houses having over 300 open work orders at the end of every month this year, Grant Houses having almost 8,600 open work orders and Manhattanville Houses collectively having over 5,600 open work orders at the end of each month. The 2017 Physical Needs Assessment  identified $42 million in necessary capital work at Audubon Houses, $415 million in necessary work at Grant Houses, and $316 million in necessary work at Manhattanville Houses and Rehabs II and III. This work must be completed to maintain NYCHA residents' housing in liveable conditions.  ","Manhattan Community Board No. 9 (MCB9) concerns itself with the processes by which Community Board 9 district's economy can become more robust, creating wealth and community benefits; anything that promotes opportunities for economic growth to the advantage of the citizens of the community. This involves financial resources to cultivate entrepreneurship as well as literacy rates, infrastructure, access to housing, and health care. These efforts are imperative as local employment remains stubbornly high compared to national levels (est. 11.2% in ZIP codes 10027 and 10031) and the persistent lower income levels in the district. MCB9 seeks to support the retention and expansion of startup entrepreneurs and existing businesses which could be Retail, Industrial or Nonprofit, so long as the projects create value and wealth for the MCB9 residents and the community. MCB9 would like to work closely with the New York City Economic Development Corporation (NYCEDC) to explore the best practices for supporting the existing manufacturing zone, referred to as the New Amsterdam Special Use District in the 197-a Plan, as currently being considered in the West Harlem Rezoning effort and repurposing the Marine Transfer Station to create economic opportunities for MCB9 residents. Presentations by NYC's Fresh Initiative representatives to discuss bringing healthy supermarkets, including a Farmer's Market to Hamilton Heights or northern Manhattanville. MCB9 works diligently to help small business owners, bodegas, street vendors and other entrepreneurial efforts in our district attain economic sustainability.  National studies show that as many as 60 to 70% of new jobs will come from local companies, not new ones coming in. Therefore, and especially in view of the present global pandemic, it is vital that local companies get the help they need so that they can recover from the challenges that COVID-19 has caused and expand their capacity beyond levels at which they had previously operated. It is of paramount importance that businesses within MCB9 are connected to resources both in the kind of financial institutions as well as other kinds of nonstandard sources.  Developing strategies that connect companies to local resources and export opportunities and reviewing regulatory processes for expanding an operation, in addition to infrastructure development can help our local companies. The development of sewer and water systems, power, natural gas, telecommunications, space, etc., are crucial to the operations and success of local companies. Additionally, NYC EDC, NYS ESDC, Columbia University, and private groups like Janus Properties have been investing in infrastructure to support and encourage the nascent biomedical and life sciences industry in the Manhattanville area centered on W 125th Street. It is imperative that job training and placement programs/workforce development enable local West Harlem residents to find employment in the new businesses that form in the area. ","","","","","Roadway and traffic design","","MCB9 has suffered from several poorly-planned roadway redesigns, most notably on Amsterdam Avenue north of 125th Street, where several lanes were removed and unprotected bike lanes were installed in each direction. These bike lanes are worse than useless, as the M11, M100, M101, and M104 bus lines all traverse Amsterdam Avenue, so there is constantly a bus in these new bike lanes, requiring cyclists to return to the main lanes of traffic. Additionally, traffic will get backed up for vehicles making left turns, and buses have been slowed by the removal of traffic lanes. The bike lanes should be removed and replaced with bus lanes. A limited network of PROTECTED bike lanes that enable safe cyclist travel throughout the district with minimal conflicts with bus routes and pedestrians should be studied and adopted ONLY WITH COMMUNITY INPUT, while unprotected bike lanes should be avoided. Additionally, the DOT has taken up more and more curbside spaces that were previously street parking for wasteful uses such as Zipcar spots. These spaces will need to be used for curbside trash pickup by DSNY. On wide streets like W 120th street, existing parallel parking should be replaced by angled parking.","Manhattan Community District 9 needs additional curb extensions at Riverside Drive and W 120th street in order to reduce the time it takes for pedestrians to cross the intersection when heading north or south on Riverside Drive. W 120th Street between Broadway and Riverside also needs angled parking spaces on the north side of the intersection. ","The M11 bus needs more frequent service, as the buses frequently operate only 20 or 25 minutes. These buses provide crucial transportation to seniors, the disabled, and other riders unable to take the subway. ","","","","","Park care and maintenance","","Manhattan Community Board 9 (MCB9) parks have continued to remain essential space both during leisure and perilous times. Moreover, 15.52% of MCD9’s land area consists of Open Space and Outdoor Recreation uses including 27 Parks and Plazas. In addition to the recreational use of MCB9 parks, the open green area at fields, courts, playgrounds and gardens provide the essential space for our community to socialize and gather for a myriad of outdoor activities. In recent years MCB9 parks' outdated infrastructure has seen more than its fair share of duress. The MCB9 district needs site DPR care and maintenance in the form of capital improvements and increased enforcement of park regulations. It is also important to increase the participation by resident members in our 16 MCB9 community gardens to satisfy not only the ever-growing recreational needs of MCB9 but also to maintain the safe and healthy impact that parks bring to our district. Necessary maintenance includes the continued renovation of turf and track in playgrounds, repairs and installations of comfort stations, pathways, lighting, stairs and handrails, the implementation of a total tree canopy cover of 35%, and protection of trees through regular pruning and the installation of tree guards, as well as funding for native tree species in order to satisfy the planting of “A Million More Trees” initiative. Moreover, the St. Nicholas Park staircase that runs east to west at 134th Street has been closed for more than a decade. This staircase is an important route within the park, including from the playground and basketball courts at St. Nicholas Avenue to CCNY and the residential areas on St. Nicholas Terrace and beyond. Additionally, the West 148th Street steps in Riverside Park are in need of reconstruction and have been partially closed due to safety concerns from deterioration. Additionally, better lighting at both sites is needed. Attention to these requested improvements are urgent for the continued long term access and functionality of our treasured parks.  MCB9’s landmarks and historical districts are a major factor in the character and lifestyle of our district. MCB9 contains 63 Parks, Gardens and Historical sites. Furthermore, MCB9 has issued letters of support for two Requests for Evaluation of Historic Districts that are currently pending before the Landmarks Preservation Commission: the West Harlem Historic District and the Morningside Heights Historic District Expansion. Due to the efforts of preservationists and tenants of abandoned buildings during the 1970s, '80s, and '90s, MCB9 is home to some of the best-preserved contiguous architecture from the 1890s, 1900s, and 1910s. The MCB9 district needs its landmarks, monuments, and sites of cultural significance (new or existing) officially designated by the City for its historical relevance in West Harlem. We need allocated staff resources at the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission to review these requests.","The preservation of landmarks and revival of parks within the Manhattan Community Board No. 9 (MCB9) district are ever more pressing needs for the district today than in the past. Along with the current plans outlined by our city agencies to improve the 175 acres of city parkland and preserve the character of West Harlem with its 27 Parks and Plazas, 36 Historical Sites including national monuments and memorials, Historic Parks including St. Nicholas and Morningside Parks, and Morningside Heights, Hamilton Heights and Sugar Hill Historic Districts.  The budget request prioritizes specific items in which NYC agencies can reference as areas of major concern for the MCB9 district. Following the statistical trends of our area and desires of MCB9 stakeholders, our budget requests address the need for increased park regulations enforcement, the reconstruction of park and community garden infrastructure, and allocation of resources for the NYC Landmark Preservation Commission to review our requests for West Harlem Historic District and Morningside Heights Historic District Extension designations.  MCB9 Landmark Preservation and Parks goals are to create and maintain safe green-spaces which are available and equipped to serve Harlem's growing population of 132,837 people as of 2020. This is an increase of 18% since 2015. Furthermore, it is imperative to properly identify and designate all qualifying historic structures and areas within MCB9 for Landmark Preservation Commission designation. Additionally, during the past few years, our parks have seen a marked increase in homeless encampments, open substance abuse, and other public behaviors that detract from the spaces' ability to provide safe and secure recreation and athletic outlets for families and children, particularly in Jacob Schiff Park, Jacob Schiff Playground, and Montefiore Park Plaza. Additional coordination between Parks Enforcement Patrol and the Department of Homeless Services Street Outreach Consortium is necessary to achieve safe green spaces for the community. ","Preserving and expanding support and cultural opportunities to all ethnic and cultural groups in our community ranked highest on our needs list, as we discussed the issues most important to the arts and cultural community of Manhattan Community Board Nine (MCB9). Local arts and cultural organizations need:    • tools to collectively respond to economic challenges as they arise;  • technical support to integrate and improve fundraising and marketing initiatives;  • leadership and advocacy training are needed to educate the next generation of arts support and          service delivery entrepreneurs;     Manhattan Community Board No. 9 needs to identify ways to:    • increase capacity;  • improve outreach;   • implement structural changes in such a way that we are prepared to meet fiscal challenges that            force closings and curtailments. In this way, we are not simply reacting to each situation on a case             by case basis without having a pre-established structure;     In addition, MCB9 strongly supports the utilization of the arts and art appreciation as a means of community engagement, development, and empowerment. Finally, arts and cultural organizations frequently require designated spaces for performances, exhibitions, and installations, and as such are threatened by the growing lack of affordable space in our district. MCB9 needs newly dedicated arts and cultural spaces in our district to deal with the currently unmet demand for such spaces.     Also, MCB9 needs support for existing spaces which sustainability is threatened by rising costs and other pressures. MCB9 also wants to acknowledge our community’s history as a center of artistic and cultural innovation and encourage identification preservation, and restoration of historic theaters, other cultural sites, and artistic venues.","Public Libraries provide our community with substantial educational support, not only for current K-12 students but also for parents, families with young children, English language learners, job seekers, and more. Libraries provide access to reading material, technology equipment, and educational programs (homework help, literacy programs, etc.).     Manhattan Community Board No. 9 (MCB9) requests that a portion of the allocated funds be distributed to the libraries located within the MCB9 district to allow them to maintain staffing, increase days/hours of service, and increase the variety of programming and audiences they serve.    Two libraries within MCB9 (George Bruce and Hamilton Grange) also have specific capital facilities needs. These libraries have unused custodial apartments that should be converted into usable library space. In both cases, some additional construction is required, chiefly to add elevator service to make the new space ADA compliant. Libraries could use this to provide warm and inviting spaces for teenagers, or additional classrooms in order to provide more regularly scheduled programming.","Manhattan Community Board No. 9 is requesting the Board's budget be increased. Given the size of our budgets, the cumulative effect of previous budget cuts, combined with those proposed and the increasing population in the district, any further cuts would minimize the effectiveness of the Community Board.","","","","","Areas from W 133rd Streets to approximately W 145th Street in the southern section of Hamiton Heights have seen dramatic increases in shootings associated with heroin and crack cocaine distribution by gangs operating out of the Bronx and using the neighborhood as an area to sell drugs. These gangs have recruited local youth, some as young as 13, to act as runners, lookouts, and other positions. These youth, who may have educational difficulties, problems at home, or other challenges, need targeted outreach and placement into enrichment, education, and employment programs. A satellite expansion of the Cure Violence initiative based in Central Harlem is the best and most comprehensive solution. We cannot allow another generation of young West Harlem community members to become embroiled in the carceral system and have their futures dimmed. There have been several high-provile homicides in the area in the past several years, including this summer, when a 13 year old boy was stabbed to death on the uptown platform of the 137th Street City College Station on the 1 line.

Three of the District's four major boundaries are natural features: Harlem River to the north, Central Park to the south and the Fordham Cliffs to the west. The District's eastern border, Fifth Avenue, is its only boundary that is not a natural feature. According to the 2010 Census Data, Central Harlem has a population of approximately 118,000, an increase of about 11,000 over the past ten years. Harlem has witnessed a phenomenal amount of social and physical change over the past few decades. The development of hundreds of vacant lots and buildings has brought a more diverse population to the community. Presently, African Americans make up approximately 58% of the District's population, followed by Hispanic at 23%, White at 13% and Asian at 3%. Due to its long history as a center for arts, culture and social and political activism, Harlem is regarded as the cultural center for African Americans throughout the world, and one of New York City's top tourist attractions.     In the span of two years, from 2021 to 2023, District 10, encompassing zip codes 10027, 10026, 10030, 10037, and 10039, has encountered a series of significant changes and evolving challenges:  Challenges Facing District 10 (2021 vs. 2023)   	2021: The foremost concern in 2021 was affordable housing, with 56% of respondents highlighting it as a pressing issue. Crime and public safety were also of significant concern (50%), along with the need for accessible health care services (33%). 	2023: In 2023, while the importance of affordable housing remained at the forefront (56%), the focus on crime and public safety increased (from 50% to 53%), underscoring the community's growing need for enhanced safety measures. Accessible health care services (33%) continued to be a concern, emphasizing the significance of medical facilities in the post-pandemic era.   Population Trends (2021 vs. 2023)   	2021: The year 2021 witnessed fluctuations in the district's population, including shifts in the demographics, such as an increase in school-aged children and seniors, suggesting changes in the age distribution. 	2023: Demographic shifts have persisted in 2023, indicating a consistent transformation in the population. These changes may have implications for the demand for education and healthcare services.   Land Use and Development Trends (2021 vs. 2023)   	2021: In 2021, the emphasis in land use and development trends was on the need for affordable housing creation (35%) and the preservation of existing affordable housing (16%). Concerns regarding the condition of public housing were also noted (7%). 	2023: In 2023, the focus on affordable housing creation increased (from 35% to 51%), highlighting the ongoing emphasis on enhancing housing availability and affordability. The importance of preserving existing affordable housing (16%) remained constant, and the need for improving public housing conditions (7%) persisted as a priority.   Impact of COVID-19 (2021 vs. 2023)   	2021: The COVID-19 pandemic in 2021 unveiled vulnerabilities in the district's infrastructure and city services. Concerns were raised about health code enforcement, mental health, substance abuse, and services to reduce or prevent homelessness. 	2023: The impact of COVID-19 continued into 2023, with a sustained focus on health code enforcement, mental health and substance abuse support, and services aimed at reducing or preventing homelessness. The pandemic has underscored the necessity of comprehensive public health measures, particularly in supporting mental health services and homeless populations.   In conclusion, District 10 has persisted in grappling with challenges related to affordable housing, crime, and public safety. Over the two-year period from 2021 to 2023, the community's priorities have remained remarkably consistent, with an even greater emphasis on accessible healthcare facilities and affordable housing solutions. This underscores the ongoing need for these essential services. As the district evolves, addressing these persistent challenges and working towards a safer, more inclusive, and resilient community remains paramount, adapting to changing population dynamics and ongoing public health concerns. ","","","","","Affordable Housing","","Lack of Affordable Housing: In the Survey conducted by Manhattan Community Board 10 (“CB 10”), on the subject of “District Needs,” over fifty (50%) percent of the Respondents listed the “Lack of Affordable Housing” as the # 1 Need. Whether Through its Housing Committee or Land Use Committee, the Board is reminded by its constituents that the district is facing a shortage of affordable housing options, which make it difficult, or impossible for residents to find housing that fits their budget. This compelling and distressing reality has contributed to the increase of homelessness within the District and is further exacerbated by the lack of decent short- and long-term housing options for many residents who have lived and worked within the District for decades. Affordable housing is a pressing need in Community Board District 10, which lacks sufﬁcient housing available to low income residents. Additionally, the current manner in which affordability is determined does not meet district needs. The common metric scale used to determine affordability - AMI (Average Median Income) does not accurately reﬂect the income levels of residents of CB10 as it is inclusive of residents of the greater metropolitan area. CB10 requests that the city develop its own metric scale based upon the income of residents in NYC to determine affordability of housing developments. Mandatory Inclusionary Housing (MIH) as it is currently designed and executed in communities of color is not an advantageous tool for Community District 10, it is a tool for gentriﬁcation and displacement of Black people by oversaturation of luxury housing and affordable housing bands that are not deeply affordable enough for the population. Housing development should be income targeted. Currently, the percentages of “affordable” housing units are too few and unrealistic not based on the income levels within the Harlem community. The affordability levels should be targeted to lower income bands. The current MIH system prevents in-community mobility, which means that residents who live in the community are unable to move into new housing because of the percentages that are not affordable enough. NYCHA developments are insecure, falling apart and it was recently announced that there are 9,000 units across the city with high lead levels in apartments where children under six years old live. This cannot take 10 years to ﬁx as is in the NYCHA plan, it needs immediate remediation. ","Crime and Public Safety","","Most Important Issues Related to Public Safety   Crime Prevention Programs –  General Crime and Mental Health Harlem has an issue with “quality of life” crimes. Shoplifting and petty theft has led to endangering shopper and employee’s safety and even store closings. Law enforcement should work with stores to train employees on how to handle incidents as well as encourage proprietors to install cameras or other methods to aid with safety measures. Also increasing patrols in areas deemed to have high petty theft incidents as well as continued partnerships with organizations dedicated to supporting neighborhood business’ success.    In many cases, the increase of these crimes has a direct connection with mental health and substance abuse issues. Harlem has an over saturation of Medication Assisted Treatment facilities which serve a disproportionate number of residents from outside the district compared to facilities in other locations within the city. This increased presence of drug trafficking at these sites requires an increased presence of narcotic officers and NYPD presence is needed to address drug trafficking and subsequently related gun violence.  While we are hopeful the advances in crime preventative technology will make citizens safer, we also are concerned about the invasive nature of such technology. The community needs open transparency regarding the use of technology in our neighborhoods; with clear guidelines and procedures that respect the rights and privacy of our citizens. The increased presence of Neighborhood Coordination Officers (NCOs) has been an encouraging initiative. We ask that these officers receive or continue to receive specialized training in diversity, equity and inclusion principles to understand the historic trauma of the community when dealing with law enforcement, especially around surveillance and patrols.   Domestic Violence has been a major issue in our community. We must utilize a survivor-centered approach in responding to domestic violence calls. We must also expand the use of community-based response to intimate partner violence and increase funding for survivor services outside of the scope of police calls and orders of protection. Responders should be appropriately trained in trauma informed techniques.  Double parking has also become a safety issue for pedestrians and motorists. NYPD should have added patrol in areas prone to double parking.  We request that the City fund and lead a task force to explore the connection between mental health and public safety. We also request a dedicated safe space that is a balanced collaboration between law enforcement and mental health professionals. Officers should also undergo basic trauma informed care training. Trauma informed care training should be required for NCOs as well as any officer that might be called to deal with those living with mental health or domestic violence issues.    Gun Violence Over the past, years there has been a consistent uptick in gun violence. It is a public health crisis. We request more Gun-Buy Back Programs, which make it easier for individuals to surrender firearms. The city needs to continue to work with existing CURE Violence organizations, funding them to create innovative techniques that reach all demographics. There should also be a study that examines the direct connection between poverty and gun violence that would support increased funding for job training programs that provide living wage employment.  Warrant expungement and chances to clear summons give opportunities for those that have outstanding warrants or summons to resolve their legal issues giving them a better path to obtain employment. Workforce development programs focused on youth and individuals re-entering society should receive increased funding. Apprenticeships that evolve into union jobs should be increased, as well.  We request that the city provide increased funding for CURE violence programs. We also ask that the city increase gun buyback programs as well as warrant expungement programs.  We also request increased funding for job training programs especially those focused on apprenticeships. ","Health care services","","Community District Needs Related to Health Care and Human Services The community requests additional funding for mental health services. There is a lack of programs in the Harlem community to address individuals with mental and emotional crisis situations. Some of the reasons for the lack of services include limited access to quality care, stigma, mistrust of the health system and lack of awareness about mental illness. For those mental health services that exist there is usually a long waiting list, lack of adequate health insurance or high financial cost to access the services. The community is requesting funding for community-based mental health services that are free of provider discrimination where the staff are culturally competent so that the appropriate diagnosis and treatment occurs. Good mental health can improve one’s wellness, coping skills, relationships, educational achievement, employment as well as economic potential. In addition, good mental health reduces health problems, ease social care cost and decreases suicide.","","","","","Mental health and substance abuse treatment and prevention programs","","The community requests additional funding for mental health services.

It is a 260+ bed, acute care facility, with a mix of primary and specialty services addressing the health needs of patients throughout Harlem, Washington Heights, the Bronx and the remainder of New York City. Harlem Hospital is the economic engine of the community. Many of their employees reside in the neighborhood of Central Harlem. The community requests more funding allocated to Harlem Hospital for capital improvements to the physical plant and ventilation (HVAC) systems, to address nursing staff shortages, to increase pediatric and adult asthma care programs, to add midwife and doula staff as well as resources to improve Black Maternal Health. Further, Harlem's community-based affiliated clinics should be strengthened given the influx of urgent care centers in Central Harlem. It should be noted that community-based clinics provide primary care services which is the key entry point into the health system. It provides the patient with ready access to their own personal physician and health care team. Urgent care centers provide episodic care and do not focus on the total needs of a patient. They focus on the delivery of medical care for minor injuries and illnesses that are not life-threatening. Thus, the community focus is on strengthening community-based clinics to improve access to preventative care services to engage the patient in their care decisions, to seek out lower medical cost and to coordinate the delivery of health care with community hospitals such as Harlem.  Need for Healthy Home Program  The community requests funding for free health home programs in Harlem. A healthy home is a program that helps you manage all the care and services you need. In a healthy home, you work closely with a Care Coordinator, who helps you better understand and manage your health conditions. A Care Coordinator works with the patient to create a plan of care that meets all of your physical, mental health and social service needs. For example, the Coordinator can refer you to resources you need to stay healthy from promoting weight loss and improved eating habits to addressing the challenges of substance use. There is limited number of home health programs in Central Harlem.  Need for Home Based Services  The community requests funding for home base programs to provide individuals experiencing housing instability with, various homeless prevention services and aftercare services to families and individuals exiting NYC DHS shelters to permanent housing. These services should include assistance obtaining public benefits, emergency rental assistance, financial counseling and money management, education and job placement.  Need for Mental Health Services  The community requests funding for a lack of programs in the Harlem community to address  individuals with mental and emotional crisis situations. Some of the reasons for the lack of services include limited access to quality care, stigma, mistrust of the health system and lack of awareness about mental illness. For those mental health services that exist there is usually a long waiting list, lack of adequate health insurance or high financial cost to access the services.

","","","","","","","","Childcare services","","With New York City experiencing the most acute childcare crisis in decades, it is no surprise that community members in Manhattan District 10 prioritized childcare services as a top district need. The New York Times reports that a family here would have to make more than $300,000 a year to meet the federal standard for affordability — which recommends that child care take up no more than 7 percent of total household income — to pay for just one young child’s care. A typical city family actually spends more than a quarter of its income on care for one child. Yet even as childcare is cost-prohibitive for Harlem families, the neighborhood’s childcare providers struggle to make a living wage. We request that the City fund and lead a task force to explore its childcare shortage; its impact on families, on childcare workers, and on childcare businesses; and possible solutions.  Once children reach age 3 they become eligible for free PreK programs, which provide both a solid educational foundation and free childcare for our district’s families. Yet Central Harlem ranked 39th out of almost 60 city districts for PreK enrollment. According to Robin Hood’s Poverty Tracker, families in poverty expressed the greatest interest in applying but had the lowest rates of 3-K enrollment (15%). Across the city, areas with the highest COVID rates also saw the most PreK enrollment challenges, as parents, already struggling, were unaware of the availability of PreK programs or were reluctant to send their children to a group setting. We request that the City fund outreach to CD10 parents, with a particular focus on low-income families and those living in poverty, to ensure that no seats in the district PreK3 and 4 programs go unused. ","Childcare Services  With New York City experiencing the most acute childcare crisis in decades, it is no surprise that community members in Manhattan District 10 prioritized childcare services as a top district need. The New York Times reports that a family here would have to make more than $300,000 a year to meet the federal standard for affordability - which recommends that child care take up no more than 7 percent of total household income - to pay for just one young child's care. A typical city family actually spends more than a quarter of its income on care for one child. Yet even as childcare is cost-prohibitive for Harlem families, the neighborhood's childcare providers struggle to make a living wage. We request that the City fund and lead a task force to explore its childcare shortage; its impact on families, on childcare workers, and on childcare businesses; and possible solutions.

We request that the City fund outreach to CD10 parents, with a particular focus on low-income families and those living in poverty, to ensure that no seats in the district PreK3 and 4 programs go unused.  Educational Attainment   DOE District 5 attendance rates lag those elsewhere in the borough and across the city. This is true for all racial and economic subgroups. Students must attend in order to derive educational benefits, and one documented way to improve attendance is to provide access to a washer and dryer so that students who lack access to clean clothing can wash clothes at school. We request that the city provide $15,963 so that Eagle Academy Harlem can install an on-site washer/dryer for use by its students.  Another key factor in student attendance and performance is good health, and the closure of school-based health clinics run by NYC Health + Hospitals in Community District 10 will deprive students of vital services. These closures come on top of a reduction in school nursing services. School-based health services are convenient and safe for parents who cannot afford to take time off of work for children's doctor appointments. Medical staff administer prescription medications; they treat minor illnesses and screen for problems such as vision loss, asthma, or sleep apnea that might impair a child's progress at school. They also provide mental and emotional health care. We request that Health + Hospitals reinstate the school-based clinics in Community District 10.   Educating our community's young people and preparing them to join the workforce must extend beyond high school. One of the goals set out by the Mayor's Executive Order 22 is that by age 25, young New Yorkers should launch successfully into fulfilling, economically secure careers. Yet one in every six New Yorkers between the ages of 16 and 24 is out of school and out of work. Unemployment among Black New Yorkers is now more than nine times that of whites according to the City's 2023 Future of Workers Task Force Blueprint. (The Black non-Hispanic unemployment rate actually rose during 2022.) We need year-round youth employment and training initiatives operating in our community. Our youth need workforce development and employment and training activities in order to be prepared. We request $2 million dollars to expand and support apprenticeships and programs and activities that help teens and young adults prepare for and secure employment. We further request that the City continue to support the Summer Youth Employment Program at the increased level available in 2023.  After-School Programs According to The Children's Aid Society, 22 million children want after school programs, and only 6.5 million children currently participate in them. Programming for children and youth aged 10-13 is particularly under-resourced in CB10. We propose that the City allocate 10 million dollars to implement after-school program services to children and youth aged 10-13.   Libraries provide important support for educational attainment and are a safe space for Harlem's children and teens during out-of-school time. For this reason we would like expense and capital funding for libraries to be a budget priority. We are asking the City in FY25 to increase expense funding for NYPL so that the branches in our neighborhood can remain a refuge and resource for our students and families.  Juvenile Justice and Services for At-Risk Youth   CB10 needs innovative programming to address the trauma experienced by children and youth in our community due to exposure to violence. Research shows that children living in Harlem are four times more likely to be involved in or witness a violent incident compared to children in other parts of the city. The resources provided by the city to address these issues do not meet the needs, or simply do not exist. We propose that the city allocate $10 million dollars targeted to interventions and treatment services designed to address the impact of overexposure to violence on the emotional resilience of children and youth in our community.    ","Community District Needs Related to Youth and Community Services and Programs in partnership with local non-profit organizations and community based entities such as Silicon Harlem, CB10 seeks funding from NYC DYCD to support STEM and STEAM programs that enhance, compliment and integrate youth development programs throughout the District. This includes opportunities for school and community groups to engage youth in ecological studies in CB10 Parks and other programs such as COMPASS NYC. Many of our school buildings are in disrepair and need capital upgrades. The auditoriums need to be remodeled and provided with safer accomodations. The doors of our school buildings need to be automated for people with disabilities and special needs. These provisions will provide greater assistance to the community at large and support to the families that we serve. ","","","","","Other - Write In (Required)","","In many cases, the increase of these crimes has a direct connection with mental health and substance abuse issues. Harlem has an over saturation of Medication Assisted Treatment facilities which serve a disproportionate number of residents from outside the district compared to facilities in other locations within the city. This increased presence of drug trafficking at these sites requires an increased presence of narcotic officers and NYPD presence is needed to address drug trafficking and subsequently related gun violence.  Double parking has also become a safety issue for pedestrians and motorists. NYPD should have added patrol in areas prone to double parking.   Harlem precincts have the highest number of CCRB (Civilian Complaint Review Board) complaints in Manhattan to address this; we request more community affairs officers to host community interventions that will foster better police community relations, including public attendance at roll calls to get to know the officers that serve our community.

This increased presence of drug trafficking at these sites requires an increased presence of narcotic officers and NYPD presence is needed to address drug trafficking and subsequently related gun violence. Gun violence in our communities is a public health crisis. On the City level, we must further the success of providing preventive measures to halt the violence. We must prioritize the experiences of all especially Black Indigenous People of Color Trans, Black and Brown, and in  low-income communities who are significantly impacted by this crisis by implementing targeted solutions that address the root causes of gun violence. Law enforcement's recent broad deployment of technology has raised legitimate questions on how under-regulated mass surveillance can negatively impact New Yorkers. We need a community-regulation process around the usage and deployment of surveillance technology to ensure that it is fully transparent, non-discriminatory, respectful of privacy rights and limited to necessary use. Harlem precincts have the highest number of CCRB (Civilian Complaint Review Board) complaints in Manhattan to address this; we request more community affairs officers to host community interventions that will foster better police community relations, including public attendance at roll calls to get to know the officers that serve our community. We must utilize a survivor-centered approach in responding to domestic violence calls. We must also expand the use of community-based response to intimate partner violence and increase funding for survivor services outside of the scope of police calls and orders of protection.  We need appropriately trained responders. ","No comments","","","","","Air quality and pollution","","Manhattan Community Board 10 has historically had one of the highest rates of asthma in our nation, whereas 1 in four children in Harlem visit an emergency room due to an asthma related illness. Poor air quality also leads to higher rates of cancer and other chronic illnesses which disproportionately affect low income and predominantly black and Latino communities such as CB10.  CB10 requests that NYC increase monitoring of air quality at the neighborhood level to combat aforementioned disparities. NYC Community Air Survey recognized the main drivers of street level air pollution as high traffic volume and the use of residual heating oil. Such results informed and reaffirmed the need for strategic policy efforts to improve air quality in the city by targeting the most polluting sources and locations, as well as showing the need for accurate measurement of exposure concentrations of important air pollutants. Such data will continue to allow policymakers to track changes over time, measure the effects of local emission reduction initiatives, and focus on reducing PM2.5 emissions and exposure disparities across NYC neighborhoods that are disproportionately affected by related health impacts.Plans to enhance NYCCAS include the expansion of monitoring efforts to examine exposure in different traffic configurations and at different times of day.  CB10 requests that the city prioritize reducing levels of Sulfur in Heating Fuels, promoting the use of biodiesel in heating fuels, and incentivize property owners to retire old, inefficient boilers via abatement, subsidy, and or public financing programs, and retire and replace old inefficient boilers in municipal building, school buildings and NYCHA.  Whereas Heating fuel can contain levels of sulfur ranging from 2,000 ppm in distillate oils used for domestic/residential applications, to as much as 10,000 ppm sulfur and even 25,000 ppm sulfur in residual oils used by industrial and large commercial applications.145 By comparison, diesel fuel used in on-road applications, such as long-haul trucks, is capped by the U.S. EPA at 15 ppm.Highway low-sulfur diesel fuel can be used in many heating applications, thereby reducing the level of air pollutants such as SO2 and PM2.5 that are emitted when fuels are combusted. Due to additional processing to desulfurize petroleum products, heating fuels with lower sulfur contents are more costly than their high-sulfur counterparts. However, low-sulfur heating fuels produce fewer by-products, reduce the rate of heating equipment fouling, and improve burner efficiency so that the amount of fuel consumed is reduced. Additionally, boilers or furnaces burning cleaner fuels do not have to be serviced or vacuumed as frequently. Therefore, low sulfur fuels actually reduce boiler operating and maintenance costs for homeowners and building operators. ","Maintenance and Cleaning of catch basins, sewers, storm drains; from debris buildup in street drainage systems affecting adjacent buildings and flooding of streets are needed.","One of the most pressing needs of our district is trash removal and cleanliness. The District Office and many of our standing committees (Economic Development; Health and Human Services; Transportation and Housing) have all heard from the community that there is a critical need for additional basket service from the New York City Department of Sanitation. From the economic development side, the 125th Street Business Improvement District (BID) has petitioned CB 10 to assist in securing greater and more consistent collection of garbage along the 125th Street corridor. Reports done by Columbia  and CB10 indicate the disparity and infrequency of collection by DSNY between our and other districts. CB 10 supports the efforts of the 125th Street BID and requests that more consistent and focused trash collection extend to the commercial corridors of 116th Street, 135th Street and 145th  Street as well as on our commercial avenues and boulevards north and south. As the 125th Street BID suggests in their recent presentation, lack of garbage collection not only has a negative and adverse impact on the operation of the associated businesses but echoes the contention of our Health Committee that it creates health concerns for our residents due to the reality of increased rodent infestation. On Wednesday, August 2, 2017 Mayor Bill De Blasio held a town hall for the residents in CB10. Both CB10 and the BID voiced these concerns, asking the Mayor to take the task.  We hope and believe Mayor De Blasio will address this major concern and would like information on how much funding would be allocated and when.","","","","","Affordable housing creation","","Explanation","A Central Harlem Rezoning study  Pursuant to Local Law 175 of 2016, the City is responsible for publishing a list of capital and programmatic commitments associated with neighborhood-scale rezonings, and an annual progress report detailing the status of each initiative. These rezoning commitments are the product of comprehensive and community-driven planning processes in each neighborhood and have been organized by policy domain: Housing; Open Space; Community Resources; Transportation and Infrastructure; and Economic and Workforce Development.  This community wishes to avoid the MIH rezonings that have occurred in East Harlem, Inwood and Jerome Avenue, where over production of market rate housing has begun to cause gentrification and displacement.  Community Board 10 requests funding to support a community driven rezoning plan to protect neighborhood residents from developer driven rezonings as was sought at Lenox Terrace.  West Harlem created a rezoning plan to protect the residential character of the neighborhood, CB10 which includes most of Central Harlem would benefit from such a plan. The goal of the plan is to ensure that Central Harlem remains an affordable and livable neighborhood for working families and to improve the quality of life for all Central Harlem residents.  Section 8 Vouchers (Project based) for market rate or other units developed through mandatory inclusionary housing. CB 10's Housing and Land Use Committees will consider and resolve that New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development, identify and track all existing and newly planned affordable housing developments and mandate that all such projects receive commitments for Section 8 Vouchers to support and sustain affordability and prevent displacement. ","Affordable housing is a pressing need in Community Board District 10, which lacks housing available to lower income residents. Additionally, the current manner in which affordability is determined does not meet district needs.  We need affordability levels to be determined by community AMI (Average Median Income) of the community rather than citywide or based on Rockland County.  Mandatory Inclusionary Housing (MIH) as it is currently designed and executed in communities of color is not an advantageous tool for Community District 10, it is a tool for gentrification and displacement of Black people by oversaturation of luxury housing and affordable housing bands that are not deeply affordable enough for the population.  Housing development should be income targeted.  Currently, the percentages of ""affordable"" housing units are too few and unrealistic not based on the income levels within the Harlem community. The affordability levels should be targeted to lower income bands. The current MIH system prevents in-community mobility, which means that residents who live in the community are unable to move into new housing because of the percentages that are not affordable enough.  NYCHA developments are insecure, falling apart and it was recently announced that there are 9,000 units across the city with high lead levels in apartments where children under six years old live.  This cannot take 10 years to fix as is in the NYCHA plan, it needs immediate remediation.  We know that Lincoln Houses in the district was targeted for clean-up, (we can try to get a full list, if any, of additional developments in the district).  The total number of NYCHA developments (so far) where lead has been found is 93. The board is requesting funding to develop a comprehensive urban planning study to identify opportunities for development of more affordable affordable housing for low income residents.   Specifics:   	Section 8 Vouchers (Project based) for all affordable housing developments we approve through ULURP; 	Preferences for District member residents in new affordable housing developments as furtherance of our joint Housing/Land Use Resolution; 	More supportive housing (for Seniors and the Disabled); 	Community income based AMI; 	Use of existing housing vacancies for priority, permanent housing for homeless families currently living in shelters or temporary housing; 	Greater tenant protections against displacement, including but not limited to:    	Immediate expansion of Right to Counsel to all zip codes, including increase in income levels for RTC legal services (even in advance of the threat of eviction) 	More rent forgiveness and rent relief (increase budget for current rent relief programs:  even for those who are not able to establish COVID-19 related impediments for rental payments) including CityFeps and SOTA 	Expansion of succession rights for all tenants (rent stabilized; Mitchel-Lama; NYCHA) to include individuals who live in the unit who are not first degree relatives.    	Moratorium on HDFC Foreclosures and Lien Enforcement 	More Green spaces for affordable housing developments 	Central Harlem Rezoning study and creation  ","While economic development projects are often heavily subsidized by taxpayer dollars, they produce decidedly mixed results for community members.  While many of these projects bring sorely needed jobs and tax revenues back to areas that have been disinvested, there is usually no guarantee that the ""ripple effects"" of the projects will benefit current residents.  Community benefits agreements and local hire language can help ensure local jobs are allocated to community members.  We need to require that DPR negotiate a CBA with all selected developers for CB10 parks, playgrounds and recreation centers.  We need to require that DPR establish CBAs and local hire language on all projects awarded in CB10 to ensure agreements between contractors and community members guarantee that job opportunities be made available to CB10 residents  Responsible local contractors hiring local workers can provide the same service at a comparable cost to contractors seeking out-of-state workers.  Additionally, local workers spend their paychecks in the local economy.  NYC receives tax revenue from NYC residents and businesses that outside workers and businesses are not subject to, therefore we should recognize, respect and protect our investment in NYC.  Youth Workforce Development and Summer Youth Employment Program (SYEP)  The youth unemployment rate in CB10  has skyrocketed- rising to a  staggering 35.2 percent  from its pre-pandemic rate of 6.6 percent, this according to a New York City Comptroller Report.  CB10 is one of just a few of the 59 community districts where the unemployment rate for 20-24 year olds exceeded 20% in 2016. We need year round youth employment and training initiatives operating in our community. This type of intervention is a necessary requirement so the future of our community can  successfully participate in the city and state workforce. Our youth need workforce development and employment and training activities in order to be prepared. We request that at least 10 million dollars from the city.  ","","","","","Traffic safety and enforcement (cars, scooters, ebikes, etc.)","","Traffic safety and enforcement issues in Central Harlem, like many urban areas, include a range of concerns: Pedestrian Safety: Central Harlem has witnessed a high number of pedestrian accidents. Issues like inadequate crosswalks, speeding vehicles, and driver negligence pose significant pedestrian risks. Traffic Congestion: The neighborhood experiences traffic congestion, leading to delays and a higher likelihood of accidents. Overcrowded streets can make it challenging for emergency services to respond promptly. Enforcement Gaps: Inconsistent traffic law enforcement can lead to violations, including running red lights, speeding, and failure to yield to pedestrians. Stricter enforcement is essential to promote compliance. Infrastructure Deficiencies: Poor road conditions and inadequate signage contribute to accidents and road safety issues. Maintenance and infrastructure upgrades are necessary to address these deficiencies. Bicyclist Safety: Central Harlem has seen an increase in bicycle usage. Ensuring the safety of cyclists, including the provision of protected bike lanes for protection from vehicles, is crucial. Community Engagement: Engaging with the community to identify specific traffic safety concerns is essential. Residents can provide insights into areas where improvements are needed. Public Transportation Integration: Integrating public transportation and traffic safety is vital. Coordinated planning can reduce the number of accidents and enhance overall safety. Addressing these traffic safety and enforcement issues in Central Harlem requires a comprehensive approach involving local authorities, community organizations, law enforcement agencies, and infrastructure improvements. The goal is to create a safer and more livable neighborhood for both residents and visitors. ","The increase of bicycles and e-scooters in Community Board 10 is a safety risk to pedestrians , especially senior residents, as there is currently no regulation, oversight, or enforcement of traffic laws for these vehicles and in the event of accidents involving pedestrians. While biking is a healthy and low cost mode of travel, its use is largely seasonal and the permanent loss of parking creates a disruption for residents year round. CB10 requests environmental impact studies and community input prior to the introduction of new bike lanes in CB10 or the leasing of street space to Citibike and e-scooters.  Furthermore, due to the increasing population of Central Harlem, placement of Citibikes, and other developments that may affect parking, Community Board 10 requests the Department of Transportation (DOT) to conduct a parking study to address the loss of parking spaces in our community. The study should include an evaluation of the current parking situation as well as available parking garages in the community. Also, other parking remedies such as a continued reduction in the alternate side parking and parking permits for certain residential areas. CB10 requires wheelchair accessibility for transit stations on 155th,148th, 145th, 125th, 116th, 110th street on 2,3 lines and A,B,C and D lines which are major transportation hubs in the Central Harlem area. In addition, to the regular maintenance and renovation of bus stops throughout Community Board 10 to ensure that seniors and persons with disabilities have equal access to public transportation throughout Central Harlem. CB10 requests that the Department of Transportation expand the M1 to Grand Street via 5ave / Broadway route to begin at 147th street and Adam Clayton Powell jr Blvd. The current M1 to Harlem 147th Street via Madison Avenue Bus route ends on 147th Street and Malcolm X Blvd in front of Esplanade Gardens a Mitchell-Lama development which comprises six 27-storey buildings with a total of 1,872 apartments. However, the downtown route for the M1 to Grand Street does not begin at 147th street, forcing commuters to walk to 145th Street to gain entry to the bus for their commute.  This is a major inconvenience for senior commuters and persons with disabilities which restricts access to public transportation, especially considering that the 148th street 3 train subway station currently has no ADA accessible access. The fleet of surrounding vehicles at PSA 6 in Harlem presents an inconvenience for residents commuting via private and public transportation. CB10  requests that PSA 6 reduce or relocate parked vehicles to ensure residents have access to parking and public transportation. ","Public Transportation Integration: Integrating public transportation and traffic safety is vital.  Coordinated planning can reduce the number of accidents and enhance overall safety.  Addressing these traffic safety and enforcement issues in Central Harlem requires a comprehensive approach involving local authorities, community organizations, law enforcement agencies, and infrastructure improvements. The goal is to create a safer and more livable neighborhood for both residents and visitors. ","","","","","Access to and quality of cultural programming","","Central Harlem Art and Culture The Central Harlem Arts and Culture community has distinct needs essential for its growth and sustainability.  Affordable Studio and Exhibition Space: Central Harlem's artists require access to affordable studio spaces to create and showcase their work. As gentrification drives up real estate prices, it's crucial to provide affordable, long-term spaces for artists.  Funding and Grants: Financial support, through grants, low or no interest SBA loans, scholarships, or artist residencies, is vital for artists to sustain their creative endeavors and promote their work. Accessible funding opportunities can help artists thrive.  Educational and Training Programs: Central Harlem artists would benefit from technical assistance workshops and training programs that can enhance their skills, especially in the digital realm, to adapt to changing art trends and technologies.  Community Engagement and Exposure: The arts community needs opportunities to engage with residents and visitors, whether through open studios, art walks, or public art installations. Exposure within and outside the neighborhood is essential for artists to gain recognition and support.  Cultural Preservation: Given Harlem's rich history, there is a need for more initiatives and resources that celebrate and preserve its cultural heritage. The arts community can play a pivotal role in contributing to the neighborhood's cultural identity and economic growth.  Inclusivity and Diversity: It is vital to ensure that the arts community in Central Harlem remains diverse and inclusive, representing a broad spectrum of voices and experiences. Addressing these needs is critical for Central Harlem's arts community to continue flourishing, enriching the neighborhood's cultural landscape and contributing to its vibrancy. It requires the collaborative efforts of local city authorities, art organizations, and key stakeholders to create an environment where artists can thrive. ","Parks, gardens and recreation centers provide a needed network of recreational and learning spaces for youth and adults of all ages.  The disparages, made evident by the ravages of COVID19 have revealed the need to strengthen our green space resources.  Youth in CB10, who suffer from alarming rates of obesity, diabetes and asthma, are particularly in need.  Most CB10 residents come from moderate to low income families who must make the most use of their local parks. CB10 has 23 parks and 32 community gardens spanning 38 acres of green space including parks, playgrounds, sitting areas, greenstreets and community gardens. CB10 recognizes that there are different types of Park users with different accommodation needs. Manhattan Community Board 10's (CB10) 23 parks, including Central Park and Highbridge Park, 31gardens and 2 recreation centers are integral to the successful viability of the community and ecosystem.  These open green spaces and facilities provide access to recreational opportunities, increase property values, spur local economies, combat crime, and protect us from environmental impacts.  They facilitate a needed network of recreational and learning spaces for all age groups.  Robust and diverse activities must be made available year-round to engage and promote the health and well-being of our youth.  For the senior adult population, active aging is a tremendously important key to continued physical and mental health.  Seniors need green spaces to be able to regain lost agility and increase their strength and flexibility.  Frequent visits to parks can help reduce depression and anxiety.  Exercising in parks can reduce stress and lower cortisol levels for our adult population.  CB10 parks need to offer a wide range of programming that will help our residents of all ages to have increased quality of life within our urban setting. Safety in our parks is paramount.  We must have ongoing and consistent enforcement of regulations.  This can be accomplished through increased Park Enforcement Patrol (PEP).  Homeless encampments must be prevented while respectfully addressing the needs of homeless persons.  CB 10 benefitted from the mayoral Community Parks Initiative (CPI) program launched in 2014 by Mayor Bill de Blasio and Parks Commissioner Mitchell J. Silver -a multi-faceted program to invest in under-resourced public parks located in New York City's densely populated and growing neighborhoods with higher-than-average concentrations of poverty.  Multi-millions have already been invested to improve CB 10 parks; close to 13 capital projects are either recently completed, in design, or soon to be constructed.  The Parks and Recreation Committee continues in its pursuit of bringing 100% of CB 10 playgrounds, parks, plazas and recreation centers to excellent condition.    Community gardens are explicitly designated as green spaces for the common good and historically have helped to stabilize distressed neighborhoods, as in the case of CB10 throughout the 70's, 80's and 90's.  Social ties are important to the wellbeing of people in a community as they bring positive health effects and community involvement.  Community gardens allow for the creation of social ties and build a greater feeling of community.  These connections help reduce crime, empower residents and allow them to feel safe in their neighborhoods.  In addition, Community gardens help to reduce negative environmental impacts by promoting sustainable agriculture; reducing food transportation costs and reducing water runoff.  Property values are also increased by proximity to community gardens.  CB10 continues to seek to maintain a balance between preserving open and green space for constituents while creating affordable housing.  ACP Malls is undergoing planting of native plant species to promote return of the native flora and fauna to the area.  This is being accomplished through the collaborative partnership of Friends of ACP Malls, NYC Parks and botanists from the NY Botanical Gardens.  We need to promote more partnerships and stewardship of this nature.  Our community gardeners must be supported through ongoing efforts to identify resources to promote sustainability of these vital green spaces.  CB 10 would greatly benefit from a master plan that would foster the strengths of our recreational  spaces, accommodate the diverse needs of our community, resolve problem areas while facilitating coordinated long-term efforts between agencies, non-profit partners, elected officials and community groups. A conceptual plan would be used to guide the next two decades of sustainable and resilient parks through increased stewardship, latest environmental and programming technologies for current and future generations. ","The arts and culture community in CB10 has been severely impacted by COVID19. The State's restrictions on entertainment and use of venues, has disrupted the income of artists and reduced the commercial traffic vital to small businesses. In order to support and restore the vibrant arts and culture community CB10 requests  grants for local artists in Central Harlem to create  local programing, increased funding for non-profit art centers and institutions, subsidized co- working space and galleries for local artists. Central Harlem has transformed dramatically in recent years due to new development and the demolition of historical sites such as the Women's Pavilion at Harlem Hospital, where Dr. Martin Luther King was once treated. To maintain the cultural integrity of Harlem CB10 requests the creation of additional grants for local artists to develop public works dedicated to African American history and the Harlem Renaissance. ","Libraries are often the first place that communities turn to for help and information, and our branches are uniquely positioned to provide relevant and up to date information to New York's most vulnerable populations. Libraries are a place for learning, safe and open access to information and will always welcome all New Yorkers. In an effort to continue to support our most vulnerable New Yorkers we are urging the City in FY22 to increase expense funding so that all neighborhoods and communities in our city have access to a library seven days a week ","No comments","","","","","Explanation","","","","","","","","","","MN10","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ours is a racially and ethnically diverse community that is home to approximately 123,582 residents; 43% of which identify as Hispanic/Latino, 29.5% as Black non-Hispanic, 13.9% as White non-Hispanic, and 9.7% as Asian non-Hispanic (American Community Survey 5-Year Data (2009-2021). Throughout our district are bustling streets and local businesses, engaged cultural institutions, vibrant street art and murals, carefully tended-to community gardens, and most of all, a community dedicated to advocating for and preserving their home. Always welcoming of new neighbors, we strive to maintain our rich cultural heritage, an enduring legacy of social justice action, and the existing character of our community.  Our neighborhood has seen change throughout its history but has always maintained its working-class identity and culture. Unguarded neighborhood change brought on by rapid redevelopment and displacement threatens to undermine neighborhood character and the communities' sense of place. The people of a community determine its character and uniqueness, however, these aspects will be stripped away without careful consideration and planning ahead of change. It's incumbent on the City to ensure that communities like East Harlem remain affordable to working-class families while maintaining their unique culture, traditions and lifestyle.  Gentrification, displacement, and ever-increasing rents are constant concerns for residents of CD11. 2021 ACS 5-Year Estimate data shows a 7.9% increase in our district's population since 2010, as well as an additional 8,349 housing units (17.3% increase). While our population and housing stock increased over the last 10 years, East Harlem's Black and Hispanic populations have declined by 5.4% and 9.8%, respectively.  During that same period, other groups experienced significant increases; non-Hispanic Asians rose by 7%, while non-Hispanic Whites rose by 6.6%.  The City must prioritize the completion of its East Harlem Rezoning Points of Agreements commitments -- particularly the development of affordable housing on publicly owned sites. The development of affordable housing on the site that M11 garage currently occupies on 99th Street is a high priority for our board, as is the siting, funding and development of a new consolidated facility of the M11 sanitation garage.   Approximately 31.2% of families in CD11 live below the federal poverty level. Significant disparities exist for youth below the age of 18 and seniors over 65, whose poverty rates are 45.2% and 28.3% respectively (2021 ACS 5-year estimate). These statistics show a community that is in need of affordable housing, quality education and local hiring initiatives to increase economic development and employment. Quality schools and early childhood education are keys to lifting young people out of poverty. Affordable and convenient adult education programs are equally important to help adults adapt to changes in industries and job opportunities.   Though gun violence continues to be an issue in our district. We will continue to advocate for reducing crime, especially around NYCHA developments and other more volatile areas of the district, ensuring that residents feel safe to move throughout the neighborhood. Identified solutions include building trust between the police and community residents, in addition to bolstering prevention and early intervention services. ","","","","","Affordable Housing","","East Harlem is a community of renters; according to the 2021 ACS 1-Year Estimate, there are 50,741 (89.7%) renter-occupied units in CD11. With an adjusted annual median household income of $41,341, our renters depend on the availability of affordable housing. As housing costs continue to rise (up to 37% increase in median rent from 2010 - 2021), our residents face an ever-increasing rent burden – 21.5% of residents spend more than 30 percent of their income on rent and 29.6% of residents spend more than 50 percent of their income on rent. While East Harlem’s real median gross rent of $1,220 is lower than average NYC gross rent, it is still out of reach for many in our community. A limited supply of available affordable units combined with ever-higher rents and units lost to deregulation feed concerns about displacement and spotlight the mounting need for affordable housing in CD11.  Preservation of affordable and public housing, as well as the construction of new, deeply affordable housing, including opportunities for affordable homeownership, are incredibly important to ensure that current residents are able to continue to live in East Harlem. Seniors, many of whom are living on fixed incomes, are especially in need of permanently affordable housing so that they can age in place and peacefully enjoy their later years.   It is imperative that the Mayoral administration continue the focus on preserving and developing affordable housing units but also work diligently toward bridging gaps to ensure affordable units are meeting the need for deep affordability across household compositions, most urgently for family-sized units. Combining these strategies is essential to mitigating the displacement resulting from ever-increasing housing costs, stagnant wages, and unchecked gentrification.  Affordable Housing Preservation   Housing displacement is a constant concern for too many in our community. Those residing in rent-regulated housing are often faced with deteriorating housing conditions left unaddressed by unscrupulous landlords seeking to deregulate those units in pursuit of charging market rates. The City must continue to support and expand anti-tenant harassment protections, particularly for lower-income tenants who are the most vulnerable. The city must also remain diligent in pursuing opportunities to extend contracts to ensure existing affordable housing remains rent-regulated for the long term.  Affordable Housing Development  While much-needed affordable development has resulted from Mandatory Inclusionary Housing (MIH) and the 2017 East Harlem Neighborhood rezoning, there remains a need to create significantly more units of deeply affordable housing to serve low-income and very low-income households and supportive housing for vulnerable populations including seniors. The new ShareNYC program should be expanded to provide more opportunities for the development of affordable shared housing for low to moderate-income households.    Public Housing    The New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) remains the critical permanent affordable housing lifeline for thousands of East Harlemites. Public housing accounts for more than one-third (31.6%) of rental apartments in CD11; higher than Manhattan (8.8%), and Citywide (7.4%). As of 2023, East Harlem is home to approximately 32,259 public housing residents.   However, after decades of underfunding and mismanagement, public housing continues to suffer from neglect and a lack of necessary repairs. Essential services like heat and hot water, working elevators and maintenance repairs are frequently lacking or unsatisfactory impacting the safety and quality of life for residents. With over $32 billion in capital needs citywide, and only up to $2.56 million allocated to future commitments within this district for upcoming NYCHA projects. Our office regularly receives complaints from NYCHA residents regarding mold, broken elevators, lack of heat and hot water, general repairs, and less-than-adequate security measures.  It is vital that NYCHA work with the affected housing developments and community stakeholders, including CB11 when planning and executing each of these plans. As of this writing, several PACT projects are underway and planned for NYCHA campuses in CD11, including the Corsi Houses, Jackie Robinson, and UPACA senior developments. ","Crime and Public Safety","","Over the summer of 2023, we collected public input through a District Needs Assessment Survey. Over half of the respondents (51%) indicated that crime and public safety are among the top three most pressing needs in East Harlem, citing gun violence, substance misuse in our playgrounds and on our sidewalks, open-air drug dealing, petty crimes, and traffic violations impacting pedestrian safety.   Residents claim not feeling safe or comfortable traveling throughout the district by themselves or with their children, especially at night. Concerns about safety and an inability to feel comfortable in their environment negatively impact residents' quality of life. Further, parents worry about raising their children in proximity of public drug use and sales and the presence of street homelessness.   Residents have reported mixed responsiveness by the police, and maintain a lack of trust of police within East Harlem. Many continue to advocate for the expansion and strengthening of police-community relations through events and programs such as National Night Out, or the NYPD Police Athletic League (PAL); including increased police presence throughout the district to deter criminal activity, and foster relationships with residents and businesses that build trust.  Elements of the built environment also factor into feelings of unsafety among residents, including poorly lit areas due to broken street lamps, and the obstruction of lighting by poorly maintained street trees. DOT, DOB, NYCHA, the Parks Department, and the MTA must work together to ensure that our sidewalks, streets, parks, and open spaces, including the areas under the Park Avenue Viaduct, are properly lit and maintained.","Homelessness","","According to the Coalition for the Homeless, by May 2023, there were 89,951 homeless people sleeping each night in the New York City municipal shelter system, a 60.4% increase from July 2022. All told, the city said it had 105,800 people in its care as of July 2023, including asylum seekers and longer-term residents.” (As Homeless Population Booms, NYC Steps Closer to an Accurate Shelter Census, City Limits).  Many factors contribute to homelessness including a lack of affordable housing, poverty, unemployment, eviction, a history of incarceration, violence and abuse, substance use disorder, mental illness, or untreated medical issues. Public policy has also directly contributed to the crisis of homelessness in New York City, including reductions in government housing assistance, deinstitutionalization, and the decline of Single-Room Occupancy Housing (SRO’s). These policy changes most directly impacted the very lower income individuals and households that most heavily relied on the availability of those affordable housing options.  Communities like East Harlem which suffer from concentrated poverty and are further burdened with high crime rates, poor health outcomes, and poor housing conditions are especially vulnerable to the impacts of the homelessness crisis. It is incumbent on the City and State to fund and support initiatives and organizations working to assist individuals and families to overcome these socio-economic challenges.  The City must prioritize the development and preservation of deeply affordable housing as the most appropriate, responsible, and cost-effective way to provide for those most in need and directly address the homelessness crisis. It is vital that the City expand eviction prevention services for low-income residents to remain in their homes, including providing rental assistance and legal services.  To further reduce the shelter population and help to stabilize families experiencing homelessness, the City must accelerate its efforts to transition families from shelter to permanent housing. This can be done, in part, by converting Tier II residences, which provide temporary housing accommodations and social services to homeless families until viable housing alternatives become available, to permanent supportive housing operated by reputable, local not-for-profit housing providers. It is essential that homeless shelters provide safe accommodations free of pests, rodents, mold, and violence. It is incumbent on the City to require that shelter operators provide on-site wrap-around support services for shelter residents. Operators must be required to provide the necessary facility maintenance and security to provide a safe and healthy environment for shelter residents during their stay. As a condition of their contract, operators should be required to establish community advisory boards in coordination with their respective community boards, to include representations from relevant community stakeholders.  While it is the collective responsibility of society to do for those in most need, it is not acceptable that support services including homeless shelters be concentrated in lower-income communities and communities of color like CD11  Street Homelessness  Sadly, street homelessness has increased throughout the city and locally is most evident along CD11’s commercial corridors of 125th Street, 116th Street and 110th Street; and our public parks, mostly urgently in Harlem River Park and Marcus Garvey Park. Many of the street homeless population suffer from untreated mental illness and substance use disorder. Many others are undocumented immigrants without resources to secure housing.  The City must increase its street homeless outreach efforts in order to more effectively engage with this population including providing non-congregant shelter housing options, such as Safe Havens, for those who may be resistant to that type of shelter environment but can otherwise live independently. Funding must be allocated to support operators in mitigating the impacts of concentrating social services in a specific geographic area. Unfortunately, there are many who prey upon the most vulnerable when and where they are receiving the services they depend on to secure and support their recovery and stabilization. As such, it is not sufficient to merely site and provide the services but also to ensure that our most vulnerable neighbors are protected from those who may wish them harm.  ","","","","","Mental health and substance abuse treatment and prevention programs","","There is an oversaturation of mental health and substance abuse treatment and prevention programs in CD11 which has created a strain on community resources and contributed to a range of quality of life and public safety concerns. The City’s current siting policy is irresponsible to the individuals in need of care and also to host communities oversaturated with other services.   CB11 has called on OASAS and other regulatory agencies that have oversight over such programs, to implement an immediate moratorium on the siting of any new drug rehabilitation, chemical dependency, or treatment centers to be located in CD11 and require all existing OASAS-authorized drug rehabilitation, chemical dependency, and treatment centers, to come before CB11 prior to all reauthorizations and/or expansion of services or service capacity.  CB11 recognizes the need for treatment and support services but maintains that these should be equitably provided and not concentrated in low-income communities such as East Harlem. A condition of the contracts for providers of these services must be that they are engaged with community stakeholders including this board, to work together to address community concerns related to the center operated by the provider and its clients.  The City should aim to establish a crisis intervention program with a dedicated emergency call number for responses to mental health crises, which pairs peers with lived mental health experience and emergency medical technicians, to de-escalate mental health crises. Such a program would relieve the police department of responding to such cases for which they are not trained and do not require law enforcement engagement. However, police officers must be trained to assist on mental health crisis calls where law enforcement is requested.  The City must establish a comprehensive mental health services infrastructure across the city so that individuals living with mental illness can more dependably access the range of services they require. Much of the street homeless population is living with untreated mental illness often because of a resistance to care but also because of the lack of accessibility of care. It is imperative that the City prioritize providing accessible mental health care and support services, as well as special needs housing throughout the city and not just mostly in lower-income communities of color where resources are already stretched thin and so many other challenges are pervasive. ","The COVID-19 pandemic underscored the health inequity that is systemically entrenched in CD11. According to the 2020 Summary of Vital Statistics for the City of New York: this district suffered the highest COVID-19 mortality rate in Manhattan (273.4 per 100,000) - 25.6% greater than the citywide average (203.5 per 100,000). Compounding upon the disparity, Upper East Side residents typically enjoy among the highest life expectancies in Manhattan-87.3 years-while in East Harlem, the life expectancy is only 78.3.  According to the 2018 Community Health Profile report East Harlem's premature mortality rate (death before age 65) is 70% higher than NYC, driven by higher death rates due to cancer, heart disease, HIV diagnoses, accidents, and drug-related deaths. Relative to the five wealthiest neighborhoods, 42% of deaths could have been averted in CD11. The asthma emergency department visit rate among children ages 5 to 17 in East Harlem is 1.6 times greater than the citywide rate, (580 vs 223 per 10,000 children). According to the 2018 Community Health Profile report, ""Many childhood asthma emergency department visits could be prevented by reducing the presence of pests, mold, other asthma triggers...""; ""resources and opportunities are at the root of good health"", these include secure jobs with benefits, well-maintained and affordable housing, safe neighborhoods with clean parks, accessible transportation, healthy and affordable food, and quality education and health care"". In CD11, a significant portion of our vulnerable residents lack such resources.  Federal initiatives to expand health care to the uninsured must be supported locally through the equitable distribution of health insurance navigator programs to reduce the high number of uninsured residents. According to the 2018 Community Health Profile, ""in East Harlem, 12% of adults are uninsured and 14% report going without needed medical care in the past 12 months...""  DOHMH and Health and Hospitals should work to promote greater use of primary care physicians and expand the availability of urgent care programs to reduce the strain on local emergency rooms and decrease the number of avoidable hospital visits.  Additional funding should be targeted to expand existing community-based, peer-led preventive interventions to promote weight loss and prevent diabetes. DOE should devote more resources to develop physical education programs for all local schools and expand organized athletics. It is recommended that HPD and NYCHA host a series of workshops to educate tenants and landlords on the various indoor triggers for asthma and how they can be mitigated, including pest control. Funding should be increased for pest extermination and mold remediation services throughout NYCHA developments. Funding should be allocated towards education and awareness for children and families suffering from the symptoms of illness that can directly and/or indirectly be traced to conditions in public housing. ","According to the 2021 ACS 1-year estimate, seniors aged 65 and older now account for 15% of East Harlem's population. 28% of our community's seniors are living below the federal poverty line, more than double the rate of New York (12%). In addition, seniors in East Harlem also face high rates of social isolation, and have many concerns about safety in the community, which compounds the isolation issue. Almost 32% of East Harlem seniors are mobility-impaired compared to 26.5% citywide; in-home delivery of services are critical and senior facilities and programs need to be accessible to those with mobility concerns. There is also a need for culturally appropriate, bilingual social work and case management; increased access to dietary and religiously appropriate food options through meals on wheels and other services; and the need to expand home check in and home healthcare hours so those who are too afraid to leave their apartments for wellness visits.  According to the DoHMH's Surveillance Annual Report 2021, East Harlem suffers among the highest HIV diagnoses, prevalence, and age-adjusted mortality rates in NYC. Senior citizens are especially an overlooked population when it comes to addressing the HIV/AIDS epidemic, as individuals 50 and older accounted for 17.1% (up to 2 out of 10 people) of total HIV diagnoses as of December 2021. The report further shows that the same demographic had the highest rate of any age group for concurrent new HIV/AIDS diagnoses in NYC (31.6%) as of December 2021. This indicates that senior citizens are not getting tested early enough for HIV. CD11 has a high death rate from HIV/AIDS, and more targeted interventions and campaigns are needed to address this issue. Senior centers and assisted care facilities should be educating their residents about safe sex practices to reduce the risk of infection. ","","East Harlem's housing-insecure and low-income residents are at great risk of homelessness with 2021 real median gross rent (RMGR) calculated at $1,220 (a 15% increase from the RMGR of 2010; and an 18% increase from 2019), while approximately 31.2% of family incomes are below the federal poverty line. Currently, 29.6% of renter households in East Harlem are severely rent-burdened, spending more than 50% of household income on rent; and 21.5% are moderately rent-burdened, spending more than 30% of household income on rent. (ACS 1-year estimate, 2021)  Furthermore, there is a growing disparity between the RMGR, and real median household income (RMHI) in CD11. Since 2006, RMGR saw significant increases above 40%; while RMHI remained relatively stagnant though with significant declines (up to -20%) during periods of economic recession.     The COVID-19 pandemic has only exacerbated pre-existing racial and economic inequities and highlighted the need to protect and expand the City's social safety net. Cash assistance, rental assistance, and eviction prevention programs, anti-tenant harassment and code enforcement should also be prioritized as key components of the fight against the displacement of our lower-income residents..  With the full implementation of the City's Right to Counsel legislation, all cases that are moving forward in Housing Court will be assigned lawyers regardless of tenants' income, zip code, or immigration status. Still, the legislation is limited to tenants brought to housing court by their landlords due to non-payment. There is a need for pre-emptive legal services for tenants in need of building repairs. ","","","","","After school programs","","After school programs support social, emotional, cognitive, and academic development, reduce risky behaviors, promote physical health, and provide a safe and supportive environment for children and youth. After school programming also supports working parents, especially single parents, who might otherwise have to choose between earning income and taking care of their children. In CD11, 57% of families with children under 18 are headed by a single parent. About 43.4% of families with children under 18 years old live below the poverty level; 31.3% of those families are single-parent households (2021 ACS).  Additionally, East Harlem youth face safety concerns due to the high rates of violence and gang activity, especially in public housing. To address the unique challenges, the community and City must work together to improve after-school programs, provide opportunities for youth employment, and increase extracurricular educational services. Job training and placement programs and other youth activity initiatives should target public housing developments and other areas with high gang activity to encourage positive development and p]revent negative outcomes. DYCD should expand after-school and evening programming, provide viable alternatives to disconnected and at-risk youth and target older teenage students with evening recreational activities.   Finally, there is a lack of physical spaces for youth to spend constructive and safe time in during after-school hours, weekends and summertime. Developers should be incentivized to work with nonprofits to build these needed facilities and provide programming.","Students in East Harlem struggle academically. Approximately 42.9% of students in East Harlem (3rd through 8th grade) are passing their reading exams, while only 37.3% of students are performing at grade level in math (Citizens' Committee for Children of New York, Inc., 2019). Challenges for students have only been exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic, especially for homeless students, students with disabilities, and students with other special needs. CCC New York further reports that there are 11,606 children living in poverty (2.8% of citywide); 276 families with children living in homeless shelters (2.4% of citywide) in East Harlem; while 1,790 students are living in temporary housing (1.8% of citywide).  As of 2021, 5,985 of our students receive Individualized Education Programs (IEPs) (2.6% of citywide); while approximately 22,477 individuals over the age of 5 years are of limited English language proficiency (1.3% of citywide). DOE must dedicate additional resources, including special education teachers, on-site mental health care providers, and other tools to overcome language barriers for our students with special needs and their families to ensure their academic and socio-economic success. We should expect these needs to gain higher priority due to the current influx of asylum-seeking families with students.  East Harlem's low academic performance can partially be attributed to our district's rate of chronic absenteeism. With 31.1% of District 4, and 39.5% of District 5 students considered chronically absent, East Harlem's chronic absenteeism rate is higher than the rate for NYC overall (26.5%). Furthermore, the rate of absenteeism is considerably higher for our students with disabilities at 40.4% for District 4, and 47.7% for District 5 (37.3% for NYC overall). Missing too many days of school can cause students to fall behind, increasing their risk of dropping out, and further harming their quality of life.  Low educational attainment contributes to a cycle of unemployment and poverty that becomes increasingly difficult to change with each generation. Educational attainment in East Harlem begins to fall behind as early as nursery and preschool (East Harlem Neighborhood Plan, p 45). It is estimated that children under the age of 5 years in East Harlem, only 25% are enrolled in private or public early learning programs (2019-2020 ACS). We argue that the earlier our children are able to start their education, the further it will improve the educational attainment within this district.   The Department of Education should continue to expand its focus on STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) and include more arts, music, culture, local history, special education programs, financial education and vocational training. Considering East Harlem's diversity in population, it's important that East Harlem schools place ""culturally responsive-sustaining education (CR-SE)"" at the center. CR-SE embraces students' identities, placing aspects of their race, social class, gender, language, sexual orientation, nationality, religion, or ability at the center of their education. According to DOE, students that learn using CR-SE are more active in class, achieve higher grades, and graduate more often.   School facilities face significant capital and capacity limitations, which can lead to overcrowding, large class sizes, and increased competition between schools for resources. DOE and SCA continue to make important upgrades and advancements to facilities in the district, but more remains to be done. Some Pre-K, daycare and after-school program facilities need repairs, while others lack access to a diversity of spaces for different types of activities. ","Children under 18, make up 20.9% of East Harlem's population. Unfortunately, a disproportionate amount of youth in East Harlem live in poverty, with 45.2% of residents under the age of 18 living below the poverty level (ACS 2021). Children raised in poverty encounter a number of disadvantages that impact their ability to perform well in school, including food and housing insecurity, poor physical and mental health, and reduced concentration and motivation. Our families need resources and services to reinforce the positive development of their children.  Childcare is crucial for both the development of young children and for the economic stability and mobility of working parents, however, access to affordable childcare is out of reach for many of our families. According to the CCC of New York, only 5.6% of East Harlem families with children under 5 spend less than 7% of their annual income on infant and toddler childcare; most East Harlem families spend approximately 33.8% of their annual income on childcare, while the cost of child care is even more burdensome for single parents (71.4% of annual income). If the City's elected leaders intend to promote equity and excellence for all students regardless of family income, race, nationality, disability, or language spoken at home, then they must start with expanding childcare assistance for working parents in need of support.  Finally, services and opportunities for youth must not be limited to youth in school. Approximately 49.2% of East Harlem's youth aged 16 and older are employed, while 12.2% are actively seeking employment (ACS 1-Year, 2014-2019, 2021). The City not only must expand programs like Advance & Earn that target disconnected youth but also dedicate additional resources and time to improve access to education and employment. ","","","","","Crime prevention programs","","Although survey respondents were generally concerned about crime in East Harlem, they indicated support for preventive services -- including youth services, after-school programming, job training, and mental health services. Programming for high-risk youth and their families should be expanded throughout the district and should include late-night and weekend programming. Resources should be funneled toward improving the socioeconomic determinants of crime, particularly educational attainment, unemployment, and poverty. Local organizations that offer these resources should be supported.  The potential for strong collaboration between the police and local groups exists, but more extensive neighborhood-specific training, deeper local partnerships and increased community policing approaches are needed in order to make efforts work properly. Many individuals in East Harlem have a negative view of the police and law enforcement needs to continue to work to rebuild trust within the community.   Finally, the incarceration rate in East Harlem is the third highest in the city and more than double the citywide rate. Incarceration has a devastating effect on the futures of those incarcerated, as well as on families and the larger community. People who have been incarcerated are more likely to experience mental and physical health problems, and may also have trouble finding employment and housing. New York City should expand targeted reentry support for neighborhoods with high incarceration rates.","Public safety is a major concern in CD11. Compared with the citywide rate, East Harlem has a significantly higher rate for non-fatal assault hospitalizations with 130 per 100,000 residents annually-- more than double NYC's and Manhattan's rates (Community Health Profile, 2018). Furthermore, the serious crime rate in East Harlem was 22.3 serious crimes per 1,000 residents in 2022, compared to 14.2 serious crimes per 1,000 residents citywide (a 44.4% difference). Though residents reported the need for increased police presence, the demand for police accountability, transparency, and respect for residents remains paramount while mitigating our crime rate. ","","","","","","Cleanliness/trash collection","","Residents overwhelmingly identified cleanliness and trash collection as their most important issues. Overflowing corner bins, lack of corner bins, canine waste, clogged catch basins, vacant lots, and illegal dumping all contribute to unsanitary conditions and increased rodent activity throughout the district.  DSNY should work to identify problem intersections and introduce rodent-resistant corner bins to each identified problem area in CD11. The agency should increase the frequency of litter basket collection and sanitation enforcement of illegal dumping and canine waste laws.  Additionally, there should be a campaign, led by the DSNY, consisting of community workshops, advertisements, and public service announcements in community-relevant languages to reach the population of East Harlem to educate the community on the importance of keeping the streets clean.","The City's environmental justice law defines ""Environmental Justice Areas"" as low-income or minority communities in New York City. As an identified Environmental Justice Area, East Harlem has been and continues to be more vulnerable to potential environmental injustices and intersectional health equity complications due to factors including a history of systemic racism and inequitable resource distribution.  According to the Community Health Profile 2018, the asthma hospitalization rate in East Harlem is among the highest of all neighborhoods in New York City. The number of adults with asthma is 60 percent higher than the NYC average and the hospitalization rate is 200 percent higher than the NYC average. Among East Harlem's children, the hospitalization rate for asthma attacks is more than two times the city average. Many pollutants within East Harlem, such as the two sanitation garages, proximity to the FDR Drive and other large highways and a lack of green spaces, contribute to high levels of particulate matter in the air.   The Vision Plan for a Resilient East Harlem highlights East Harlem's vulnerability to climate change. The vast majority of CD11 lies in an evacuation zone, with many large public housing complexes located in Zone 1-- the most vulnerable area. Our neighborhood is particularly vulnerable to flooding from extreme rain, sea level rise, and storm surge; managing inland drainage is a critical priority as water is easily trapped in low-lying areas. As such, East Harlem suffered severe flooding during Hurricane Sandy in 2012 and Hurricane Ida in 2021. East Harlem also experiences high average summertime surface temperatures, due to a variety of physical factors including high density and lack of green space.  CD11 needs significant investment in hard and soft infrastructure, including centralized and decentralized stormwater management interventions, living shorelines (oyster beds, marshes, berms), floodgates, as well as community education around climate change and emergency preparedness to prepare residents for future disasters. Bold interventions, although costly, are necessary to combat the dangers of climate change and ensure the livability of our neighborhood for generations to come. Former Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that NYC Parks would receive $284 million to renovate segments of the East River Esplanade in need of repairs. It's crucial that the City continue to invest in and install green infrastructure throughout the esplanade as part of the repairs.  Finally, CB11 would like to see policies such as the Green Infrastructure Grant Program implemented and expanded to close the gap in environmental health disparities achieved through a process that ensures transparency, access, and inclusion for people at every level of the planning and decision-making process. ","Community District 11 currently hosts three Department of Sanitation facilities:   The Manhattan District 11 (M11) garage is ""temporarily"" located on East 127th Street and Second Avenue, adjacent to an elementary school, a heavily utilized public park, and a newly opened cancer treatment facility. It is now our understanding that even with the M11 relocation, DSNY intends to maintain the East 99th Street site as part of its operations, resulting in there being FOUR DSNY facilities in this district.  The Manhattan District 10 (M10) garage which serves Central Harlem is located at 132nd Street and Park Avenue, just five blocks from the new M11 garage. Because of the poor condition of the M10 garage building, most of the sanitation equipment is parked in the street and under the Metro-North railroad viaduct.    The Manhattan Lot Cleaning Unit currently utilizes a surface parking lot on East 123rd Street between Lexington Avenue and Third Avenue. This site was identified in the 2017 East Harlem Rezoning Points of Agreement for the development of affordable housing and its redevelopment is a high priority for our board. However, DSNY has indicated no intention of moving off the site and so its redevelopment remains an open question and a commitment unkept.  To resolve this underserved burden on our community, CB11 proposed funding be allocated for the construction of a new state-of-the-art consolidated facility to house the M11 and M10 garages. This request was incorporated in the 2016 East Harlem Neighborhood Plan and the subsequent 2017 East Harlem Rezoning Points of Agreement (POA) which states that the City would ""working with community stakeholders, plan for the development of an enclosed consolidated DSNY sanitation facility for M10 and M11, which meets LEED gold standards"", further that ""DSNY will immediately begin planning for a permanent, long‐term facility to serve District 11 sanitation needs, which includes the following goals:   	 	explore options for a permanent consolidated facility that could house multiple garages, including: District 11, District 10, District 9, and/or the Manhattan Lot Cleaning Unit; 	 	 	assess suitable sites for the permanent facility that will serve residents for the next 100 years. Explore all City‐owned sites and appropriate privately‐owned sites in Manhattan Community Boards 9, 10, and 11, as well as potential acquisition of the entire Block 1792. 	  ","","","","","Affordable housing creation","","Affordable housing creation  The City must prioritize the completion of East Harlem Rezoning Points of Agreements commitments and develop affordable housing on city-owned sites including the East Harlem Multi-Service Center, the 25th Precinct parking lot at East 119th Street and the lot being utilized by the Department of Sanitation’s Lot Cleaning Unit at East 123rd Street. Further the City must act to restart any stalled large scale residential development projects including the remaining commitments for the East 125th Street Development, the proposed Harlem African Burial Ground Memorial Mixed-Use Development, as well as the prioritizing redevelopment of any remaining publicly owned sites in CD11 for affordable housing including any potential leveraging of public sites to facilitate mixed-income developments with private developers.   East Harlem has a high need for affordable housing, both preserved in existing buildings and included in new construction. ","Though large swaths of the district were rezoned as a result of the 2017 East Harlem Neighborhood Rezoning, we encourage the Department of City Planning to reopen and expand the rezoning area, as requested in the East Harlem Neighborhood Plan and consider expanding Mandatory Inclusionary Housing (MIH) to cover First Avenue. Fine-grained zoning changes should be made throughout the community that both facilitate the development of housing affordable to existing community residents, as well as incentivizing nonresidential development.   While MIH will be triggered in any new residential development taking advantage of the increased density, it does not go far enough to address the need for housing that is truly affordable to East Harlem residents. We call upon HPD and HDC to identify and commit additional funding sources to provide both (a) capital subsidies to reduce construction costs and (b) ongoing rental subsidies to both extend the term of affordability for affordable units in mixed-income buildings and to enable deeper levels of affordability, including 10-15% of area median income, while still allowing for a diversity of income. We further ask that the City identify significant additional subsidies to allow for affordable homeownership opportunities and to provide a deeper level of affordability in new development, both on City-owned and privately-owned property.   In June 2019, CB11 adopted a resolution detailing its Affordable Housing Development Guidelines, which should be utilized by City Agencies and developers to design proposals that fit the housing needs of our district. CB11 resolved that development on Publicly Owned Sites should target 100% rent and income-restricted development with deep affordability and at a variety of low- and moderate-income rent levels in perpetuity where units are targeted 20% Extremely Low-Income, 20% Very Low-Income, 20% Low-Income, 20% Moderate-Income, and 20% Middle-Inc]ome. Further, development on Privately Owned Sites seeking a zoning change, should include at least 30% of the residential units affordable at an average of 60% AMI in perpetuity. Thirdly, Condominium or Cooperative Development Developers are encouraged to construct affordable condominiums or cooperatives to provide homeownership opportunities to local residents. Housing proposals that integrate both affordable homeownership and rental units are also encouraged. All condominium or cooperative units should be affordable to low-moderate- and middle-income households earning between 80% and 130% of AMI. ","Affordable housing creation  The City must prioritize the completion of East Harlem Rezoning Points of Agreements commitments and develop affordable housing on city-owned sites including the East Harlem Multi-Service Center, the 25th Precinct parking lot at East 119th Street and the lot being utilized by the Department of Sanitation's Lot Cleaning Unit at East 123rd Street. Further the City must act to restart any stalled large-scale residential development projects including the remaining commitments for the East 125th Street Development, the proposed Harlem African Burial Ground Memorial Mixed-Use Development, as well as the prioritizing redevelopment of any remaining publicly owned sites in CD11 for affordable housing including any potential leveraging of public sites to facilitate mixed-income developments with private developers.   East Harlem has a high need for affordable housing, both preserved in existing buildings and included in new construction.   Affordable Housing Preservation  CD11's housing stock is largely subsidized, rent-stabilized or public housing; only 22% of units are currently unregulated. Data provided by the Furman Center projects that 6,197 subsidized and rent-stabilized units are at risk of eligible expiration over the next 15 years. This, combined with the pressures on regulated housing due to increased development in the area, makes affordable housing programs the top concern in CD11. The East Harlem Neighborhood Plan estimated ""affordable housing need"" in CD11 as 12,000 households. Ours is one of only four districts in Manhattan that saw a net increase in stabilized units in the period of 2007-2020. It did this by gaining over 6,000 new units while losing 4,300 units over the same period. Data suggests that the efforts of CB11 to attract new housing that would be affordable and stabilized have been beneficial to the community in terms of the supply of such units in the aggregate. However, the mounting pressures of rising rents, landlord harassment, and stagnant wages continue to demand the production and preservation of affordable housing in order to forestall wider residential displacement, particularly for low and extremely-low-income households.   As more development comes to East Harlem and rising rents elevate displacement pressures for low-income tenants, it is vital that they are made aware of their rights as tenants and have access to free legal services to protect themselves and their homes from unscrupulous landlords and developers. The City is moving in the right direction by expanding funding for the representation of tenants, but current legal aid funding must be extended. Current residents should be better prepared for affordable housing lotteries. Housing preparedness clinics should be held regularly, and developers should be required to hire a third-party organization to conduct credit counseling and marketing.   Condition of Public Housing  NYCHA operates more than 15,000 apartments across 21 developments in CD11 (accounting for 31.6% of rental units), one of the largest concentrations of public housing in New York City. Public housing accounts for more than one-third of CD11's rental apartments, and remains an affordable housing lifeline for so many. NYCHA has experienced unprecedented disinvestment and deprioritization by federal, state and city agencies for generations. With over $32 billion in capital needs citywide, NYCHA residents suffer from collective neglect and lack of necessary repairs impacting their housing security. Further, the defunding of public housing has manifested short and long-term impacts on the integrity of NYCHA's building stock and the health and safety of their residents. It is critical that the city, along with the state and federal government, prioritize and properly invest the necessary funds in public housing.   ","With many of our residents out of the labor force and receiving various forms of public assistance, we urge all levels of government to refocus their approach from poverty maintenance to poverty alleviation. Workforce development programs must be paid incentives and targeted to our most vulnerable residents. We need government training programs for the structurally unemployed, paying subsidies to firms that provide training to displaced workers, helping them find where jobs exist and continue their education. This effort must include innovation, such as skills enhancement, digital skills, and working networks, as well as focusing on alternative methods of alleviation- a focus on small business creation, entrepreneurship, job-readiness, and low-cost and free childcare to support single-parent households.  As we continue to move away from policies that have contributed to mass incarceration, support is urgently needed to expand programs that meaningfully assist individuals with a history of involvement with the criminal justice system to successfully reintegrate into the workforce. Similarly, policies must be set and enforced to counteract hiring practices that are prejudiced against the formerly incarcerated. Paired with social services that aid this population, the opportunity to find meaningful and dependable means of income is vital to successful re-entry and reducing recidivism. These are our family members and neighbors; it is incumbent upon our community, service providers, and our government to aid them to the extent possible in their successful reintegration.  Some of the greatest challenges that formerly incarcerated individuals face when returning back into the workforce are: experience, low levels of education or vocational skills, and many health-related issues, ranging from mental health needs to substance abuse histories. When these challenges remain, it affects our neighborhoods and families which in turn, feeds a cycle of crime and poverty.  Local hiring boosts the local economy by creating jobs and providing hands-on training/experience opportunities that wouldn't otherwise be available would strengthen our community. This can be accomplished by providing funding for a local workforce development provider that identifies, screens, and refers local residents to appropriate employers. Labor unions should also build pre-apprenticeship programs and work to ensure apprentices are moving up through the system to earn a living wage.  Overall, economic activity must be increased to bring more businesses, commercial activity, and employment opportunities to our key commercial corridors. Financial literacy/education should be offered for free to residents, especially in NYCHA developments to promote entrepreneurial engagement. SBS must focus aid on marketing and specifically branding local merchant organizations and providers of business support services.  CD11 is anticipating a significant business interruption upon commencement of construction for the Second Phase of the Second Avenue Subway. It is necessary for the MTA and the City to mitigate the disruption that this project will bring to small businesses along the project corridor. SBS and EDC should be working proactively with business and property owners in anticipation of work commencing on this massive infrastructure project. ","","","","","Subway service and quality (frequency, access, crowding, etc.)","","CD11 residents report frequent delays in subway service at the Lexington Avenue line stations in the district. There is also a concern that these stations are not adequately patrolled by the police, particularly off hours when safety concerns are highest. Overcrowding is a persistent frustration for CD11 residents seeking to board at 125th Street. As congestion pricing is rolled out, an anticipated concern is that overcrowding will only increase and our residents will be even more inconvenienced. The MTA must make improvements to its subways schedule to better meet the needs of residents in districts such as this one that are caught between high demand to our north and the central business district to our south. The MTA must consider expansion and re-routing of buses routes in order to mitigate the unintended yet still serious negative impacts resulting from the implementation of congestion pricing.   Traffic Safety & Enforcement (cars, scooters, e-bikes)  Current levels of traffic safety and enforcement appear to work towards meeting the needs of our district. Using aggregated and normalized data from the NYC Open Data Portal - NYPD Motor Vehicle Collisions, and John Krauss's NYPD Crash Data Bandaid, there have been 662 total crashes within this district between July 2022 and July 2023 (a 5.9% decrease from July 2021 - July 2022; and 1.6% of total NYC crashes between July 2022 and July 2023); including 2 fatalities, and 853 injuries. The fatalities consisted only of pedestrians; while of the injuries, 125 were cyclists, 184 were pedestrians, and 580 were motorists.   Contributing factors in these crashes -- including driver inattention/distraction, improper passing or lane usage, unsafe speed, and failure to yield right-of-way -- arguably, are preventable through sensible traffic mitigation measures. Funds are needed to install measures throughout this district with the goal of totaling no more than 1% of total crashes throughout NYC within a given fiscal quarter.","Overall, street design improvements are needed to reduce sidewalk congestion and improve pedestrian and bicyclist safety. These design improvements are particularly vital so seniors and visually impaired residents can use the streets safely. Uneven curb cuts and cracks in sidewalks raise concerns of accessibility and pose risks to our residents with disabilities and/or mobility impairment.   In 2016, the East Harlem Neighborhood Health Action Center surveyed more than 200 residents in what culminated in the Block by Block: Walking for a Healthier East Harlem report. Of those surveyed, 57% rated the street lighting as fair, poor, or very poor. Insufficient and obstructed lighting contributes to residents' concerns about safety in the neighborhood.  Congruent to constituent sentiment, Beta.NYC Boardstat reports that residents from this district submitted a total of 1,065 requests to 311 regarding insufficient street light conditions throughout 2022 - ranking number 8 in this district's top 10 complaint types of the year; and ranking number 1 in the most numbers of this complaint type between the Manhattan community districts, accounting for 15.6% of total street light condition complaints throughout the borough in the same year. There is a clear disparity in perceived lighting conditions as all other community districts have less than 1,000 complaints in the same report. Though we acknowledge that the East 125th Street Plaza underneath the Metro-North station has significantly improved lighting, activation, and pedestrian safety - this district (particularly East Harlem North) needs the necessary funding to repair or install additional resilient light fixtures in prominent ""dark spots"", including bulbs with brighter lumens that will not pose a significant impact on energy consumption.   Several bridges and heavily traveled commuter corridors are adjacent to or pass through East Harlem, including the Triboro/RFK Bridge, Willis Avenue Bridge, Third Avenue Bridge, Madison Avenue Bridge, the Harlem River Drive/FDR Drive, and several popular avenues and cross streets. Heavy vehicular traffic has a negative impact on pedestrian safety at several key intersections and causes issues of reliability of NYC Transit bus lines. The Department of Transportation (DOT) should consider making traffic and safety improvements along Fifth Avenue between East 96th - and 102nd Streets; and on East 116th and 117th Streets by the East River Plaza. DOT should also consider extending the designated bus route on Fifth Avenue North to East 110th Street.  This board will continue to advocate for further efficient traffic flow and effective enforcement, to curb delinquent on-road behavior such as those perpetuated by all-terrain vehicles (ATVs) and motorbike users; including illegal scooters and cycle use on sidewalks. DOT, in partnership with NYPD Traffic Enforcement, must consider expanding punitive measures for placard abuse and errant parking behavior in pedestrian crossings, bike lanes, traffic-restricted areas, and throughout the Park Avenue Viaduct tunnels. ","Phase 2 of the Second Avenue Subway project must commence, as East Harlem is currently only serviced by the severely overcrowded Lexington Avenue lines. Subway stations in East Harlem need to be fully accessible for those with disabilities and/or mobility impairments. Although the Lexington Avenue line station at 125th Street has an elevator, residents report that it often does not function correctly and needs repairs. The 110th Street station recently received accessibility upgrades, the same is needed at the 116th Street station. All stations in our district are in desperate need of more frequent cleaning.  Many of our residents rely on bus service to travel to, from, and throughout the district; unfortunately, they experience significant delays with unreliable service due to traffic and the lack of enforcement of bus lanes. The MTA and DOT should work alongside CB11 to identify solutions to persistent delays in bus routes in East Harlem, particularly on Third Avenue, Lexington Avenue and Madison Avenue. NYC Transit should consider improving the M1 bus line performance by changing the route to originate north of the Queensboro Bridge, so that commuters in East Harlem are not impacted by the congestion downtown. Congestion pricing will inevitably result in direct impacts to bordering communities like East Harlem in terms of increased demand for alternative parking for those seeking to avoid tolls as well as increased demand for public transportation accessed in bordering communities. It is imperative that the MTA and DOT ensure that mitigations are in place that address the deleterious impacts on communities such as ours while seeking to alleviate congestion in other communities. ","","","","","Access to and quality of cultural programming","","East Harlem has a proud and rich cultural history and vibrant artistic community. CD11 is home to important cultural institutions including the Museum of the City of New York, El Museo del Barrio, the National Black Theatre, the Julia de Burgos Cultural Center, the Caribbean Cultural Center African Diaspora Institute, the Africa Center, the Graffiti Wall of Fame, PS 109 Artspace, and, of course, La Marqueta.  Operational funding is needed to support these important resources and encourage future growth, preservation and exploration of the arts and culture programming in CD11. Capital funding is also needed to provide the maintenance, upkeep, and revitalization of these institutions. NYC & Company should work with local artists and theater operators to promote East Harlem as a location for “Off-Broadway” theater productions spotlighting both local artists and other aspiring artists. This would be one step towards boosting tourism and bringing much-needed capital into East Harlem.  Funding must be provided for arts/cultural service organizations to enhance, educate, and expand public interest in the arts and culture of East Harlem. A campaign to bring these entities and artists to East Harlem will solidify our community commitment to the important place our culture has in New York City and re-establish our commitment to the arts. Once established, and representative of a cross-section of the East Harlem community, these organizations should work to develop a comprehensive art and cultural strategic master plan for CD11. ","East Harlem's parks serve a critical role in the health, well-being, and quality of life of our residents, however many of our parks need better maintenance, staffing, and capital upgrades. Residents report excess garbage, cracked pavement, and outdated facilities in parks. 311 data shows that the parks/greenspaces in CD11 have received 443 complaints regarding maintenance and facility conditions in 2022 (a 51.7% increase from 2021; 11% of 2022 citywide total).  DCP's Capital Planning Explorer tool highlights a considerable number of our parks, gardens, and historical sites located in flood hazard zones; due to the risks and our history of extreme flood events, improvements to parks should be required to include climate protection and resiliency features as well as additional greenery and landscaping to assist with the retention and slow release of water.   Harlem River Park, Each One Teach One, Lincoln Playground, and Marcus Garvey Park, in particular, would benefit from greater sanitation services to address their rodent and trash problems.   Safety in East Harlem's parks is also a primary concern. A few of the parks in East Harlem --  including Ronald McNair Park, Harlem River Park, and Marcus Garvey Park -- have been identified as hot spots for homelessness, substance misuse, and illicit activity.  According to the Vision Plan for a Resilient East Harlem, the average surface temperature in East Harlem in August is over two degrees higher than that of NYC overall. Key contributing factors include East Harlem's lower-than-average vegetation cover, as compared to NYC overall. Parks and trees are one of the most effective ways to combat extreme heat. Excess heat not only causes illnesses and higher risks to children and the elderly but also contributes to increases in violence.  On a basic level, the amount of open space in East Harlem is insufficient. While New York City has a standard of 1.5 acres of open space per 1,000 residents, New Yorkers for Parks has set a higher goal of 2.5 and has found that there are 2.9 acres of open space per 1,000 residents city-wide. Without Randall's Island or Central Park, East Harlem falls well below this benchmark with only 0.77 acres of open space per 1,000 residents (East Harlem Neighborhood Plan). With so much of the open space located at the neighborhood's edges, it is critical to address the physical barriers to using these parks. In the case of Randall's Island, Harlem River Park, and the waterfront esplanade, there is a need to create better access to recreational spaces, in addition to ensuring that additional green spaces are created wherever possible.  Many of our parks don't have public restrooms. CB11 is advocating for the inclusion of a public restroom at the upcoming greenway link between 125th and 132nd Streets. The board also maintains the position that the park, upon its completion, should be named Richard Toussaint Park to celebrate our former board member's advocacy for this project.  Finally, our parks perform a vital function in building social cohesion and resilience. NYC Parks should increase public programming to meet the specific needs of youth in our district, with a focus on working with the community and CB11 to help guide and conceive of projects at all scales. ","","East Harlem is home to two branches of the New York Public Library (NYPL), the 125th Street Library and the Aguilar Library. Two other branches are located across from our district boundary lines and regularly used by residents of CD11, the East 96th Street Library and the Harlem Library located on East 124th Street. Our libraries are heavily used by the local community and are an especially valuable resource to our low-income residents. In addition to supporting literacy, libraries are community hubs that offer job skills training, computer and language classes, cultural competency, art appreciation, and community building.  Both the 125th Street Library and Aguilar Library are currently closed for much-needed capital improvements and modernization. While these libraries are closed it is vital that NYPL offer extended hours and services at the neighboring branches and also provide satellite library services throughout our district. NYPL should pursue partnerships with local educational and cultural institutions and community-based organizations to house temporary floating collections and offer library programming, skills training, and other classes.  Funding must be increased so that NYPL branches can remain open until at least 8 p.m. on weekdays, offer full-day service on weekends, and continue to expand its collections, programming, and staffing. ","The operating budget for community boards should be increased to reflect the vital role they play in planning and quality of-life advocacy for neighborhoods all across the city. Increased funding would allow boards to hire additional professional staff to support the board's engagement of the community planning and development, municipal budgeting and legislative processes impacting their districts and the city at large. There has not been any significant increase to community board budgets despite labor costs increasing and inflation.    With the return to in-person meetings, post-COVID-19 State of Emergency, community boards now conduct their meetings in a hybrid format which allows the public to continue to attend and participate via video conference as they have since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting shutdown. However, our budgets have not been adjusted to reflect this new reality and status quo for public bodies in New York State. Funding is essential for community board's ability to meet the promise of continued remote accessibility for the public and offset the costs for videography services and utilization of suitable offsite meeting spaces.

The district, which is geographically diverse, is bounded by the Harlem River Drive on the east side and by the Hudson River on the west side; and runs from West 155th Street to West 220th Street. We are a diverse community of 219,657 residents, including a majority of residents 151,100 (68.8 percent) of Latino or of Hispanic heritage; 41,471 (18.9 percent) of White Non-Hispanic; 16,630 (7.6 percent) of Blacks/African American Non-Hispanic; 6,688 (3.0 percent) of Asian or Pacific Islander Non-Hispanic; 121 (less than 1 percent) of American Indian and Alaska Native Non-Hispanic (U.S. Census Bureau, 2014-2018 American Community Survey 5 Year Estimates - Population Division - New York City Department of City Planning). The largest group in the district is of Dominican descent. Community District 12 is also an immigrant community: the district has a foreign-born population of almost 50% (102K residents), with 55.5% residents not being a citizen yet. The median age in the district is 36, and almost a quarter (17.4%) of our population is under 20 years old and 14.1% of our residents are over the age of 65. We also have a high poverty and unemployment rate: 21.4% of our residents live on incomes below the federal poverty threshold, with 30.7% of those people being under the age of 18. Our district median household income ($52,052) and the Manhattan median household income is ($60,762). In addition, the American Community Survey 3-year estimates for 2010 through 2012 indicate that 10.3% of our residents ages 16 and over were unemployed and 33.6% were not in the labor force.

Provide funding to ensure that all local public schools have health clinics, is relevant for CB #12, M.  Noise complaints have incremented considerably in our community, for this reason, we request an increased staff that conducts regular noise enforcement, air quality monitoring, and water quality testing in our community.  The trash basket collection on commercial streets in District 12M, needs to be increased, and the funds to support this task as well.  The homeless situation has increased considerably in the CB 12, M, for this reason we request more funding for the Homebase Program in CB12M to prevent individuals and families at imminent risk from entering the NYC shelter system. Finally CB #12, M requires an expedited replacement of old water mains and sewer lines in our community (DEP). ","Our residents are less likely to have regular health care providers than those in NYC overall and foreign-born adults and men are least likely to have a regular doctor.  Nearly one in ten residents use the emergency room, most likely at New York-Presbyterian Hospital, when they are sick or need medical advice. One in five local adults is obese, and almost one half do not exercise. The birth rate to teenage mothers is higher in this community than in all of Manhattan and NYC overall.

We request more funding to improve connectivity options of Internet/Wi-Fi services for students in School District 6 (SD6); there is a great need of Internet/Wi-Fi Service in SD6 Provide There are 32 geographic Community School Districts (CSD) in New York.  Each district is in charge of their elementary and secondary public schools within their community.  Of these 32 CSD, District 6 consists of the Upper West Side, Harlem and Washington Heights/Inwood communities located in the northern part of Manhattan (from West 135th to 218th Street).  District 6 enrollment has approximately 25,121 students (K-12) according to district 6 data of 2015-16. There are 49 public schools in District 6, of which 31 public schools (K-8) and 8 high schools are situated within the Washington Heights and Inwood community and the remaining 10 schools are located in the Upper West Side and Harlem. There are 19 out-of- school time (OST) programs, 8 daycares and head start programs, and 3 public libraries in the community of Washington Heights.  However, local concerns regarding the improvement and increase of resources in this community continue to be a challenge.   Community District 12 is in urgent needs of significant after-school enrichment/extracurricular activities at local schools and parks within the district; the school day ends for most students around 2:30pm, and most families in the district find it difficult to provide adequate after-school supervision for this children – an increase of funding for after-school enrichment/extracurricular activities at local schools and parks within the district is highly desirable.  Furthermore, we a Comprehensive Afterschool System program  that include tutoring assistance with homework through community based organizations in school district 6.    Class Size Reduction is needed in our district and we would like that City increase funding to reduce class size in CSD6.    In addition CB #12, M needs biotech laboratory.  We would that the City provide funding for a biotech laboratory and research facility for all students at the George Washington Educational Campus to insure  there are opportunities for readiness, mentoring and hands an immersion on a genomic (DNA) level that is linked to a variety of career path in health /medical/science and non science fields.","Physical Education (PE) serves as a keystone to reinforce student’s academic achievement and prepare them to be physically and mentally active.  School districts in New York City are mandated by the NYS Dept of Education to provide students with physical education and fitness paces, and to be instructed by Certified Teacher. However, evidence continues to suggest (report issued by the Comptroller Scott Stringer that the lack of physical education increases the health risk of students to become obese. Over 25 percent of students in New York City between the ages of 5 to 14 in Kindergarten through 8th grades are obese or severely obese.  In several schools located in CB #12, Manhattan District including I.S 528, Bea Fuller Roger; I.S. 223, Mott Hall; and I.S 28 that serve students from PK-5th grades and 6th-8th grades do not have education fitness and /or their gymnasium. These schools have been waiting for the more than a decade to correct this problem. Therefore, it is imperative that DOE provides the capital funds for FY17 for the restoration and increase of physical education and fitness spaces needed in the aforementioned schools within CB#12 district.   See http://comptroller.nyc.gov/reports/droppingtheball    Additionally,  the majority the school facilities in the CB #12, M are very old in great disrepair and in need of renovation or reconstruction.  For example the swimming pool of the George Washington High School has been out of use for more than 20 years.  The students in this district does not have access to a swimming pool.  Swimming as sport is not being offered to the student.","There is a high demand for a variety of programs in the community and among them are child care to assist working parents and after school programs, job training and skill development, college readiness programs to help students succeed in higher education, healthy eating in schools to reduce obesity, and youth anti-violence programs that promote safer communities. Expanded access to the Universal Pre-K program successfully created by Mayor De Blasio – the demand for Pre-K slots in Community District 12 has outpaced the availability – including in the zoned school districts of many community residents – the City and DOE should focus on creating more Pre-K resources in the district – our district has seen an increase of almost 2,000 children under the age of 5 from this report last year – the need for Pre-K resources is on the rise.","","","","","Crime prevention programs","","CB #12, M requests for FY24 more funding to expand Domestic Violence and Anti-Sexual Harassment programs and improve multi-agency response, and an additional upgrade of the Emergency Response System ( 311 & 911) to record times and geolocations for better response, data, and transparency (and include Spanish language option)  and the expansion of Domestic Violence and Anti-Sexual Harassment programs and improve multi-agency response. The FDNY in our district requires all terrain vehicles for efficient response in CD12M’s vast parklands and add funding for cameras in parks within 33 and 34 precincts. CB #12, M also needs the addition of speed cameras in the 33rd 34th precinct (in areas where there is drag racing or death). Due to the increase in the quality of life complaints in CB #12, M it is necessary to expand public education programs on public safety issues (fireworks, driving, bike   Community District 12 requires more permanent officers (police officers, supervisors, and detectives) and police services to address issues facing an increased number of residents, visitors to the almost 1,000 acres of parkland, more events in the community and the city that require staffing which drain the resources in place, increased security at different locations, and a major increase of visitors due to a proliferation of restaurants and nightlife establishments. With an expected increase in the population due to new housing,  the services are even more warranted for crime prevention in order to maintain or decrease the major index crime statistics and any other violent or non-violent crimes.    Our two police precincts - the 33rd and 34th precincts - cover 155th to 218th Street from river to river and this landscape includes a major hospital and its affiliates; public housing developments; several large and popular parks that encompass baseball and soccer fields, a public swimming pool, three boating docks;a homeless shelter for men;  transit rail yards; a NYC Department of Sanitation depot; senior centers; a university; museums; and more than 100,000 residents with an influx of tens of thousands of tourists and visitors to the community, particularly from May through October.  Both precincts lack a sufficient number of permanent officers to address crime, particularly slashing and stabbings, violence on the street, rape and sexual assault, and gang activities as well as the increased volume of quality of life issues. There has been a vast increase of quality-of-life complaints documented by 311 calls, which include noise, loud music, loitering, car break-ins and vandalism, graffiti on private and public property; large crowds in our parks; illegal Fourth of July fireworks which last for several days before and after the holiday; the increase of the homeless throughout the city and uptown, where residents have reported homeless men congregating on sidewalks and intimidating neighborhood residents both on the street and in the subways; and illegal parking.","CB #12, M requires for FY22 an additional upgrade of Emergency Response System ( 311 &911) to record times and geolocations for better response, data, and transparency and that the City expand Domestic Violence and Anti-Sexual Harassment programs and improve multi-agency response.

The two police precincts - the 33rd and 34th precincts - cover 155th to 218th Street from river to river and this landscape includes a major hospital and its affiliates; public housing developments; several large and popular parks that encompass baseball and soccer fields, a public swimming pool, three boating docks;a homeless shelter for men; transit rail yards; a NYC Department of Sanitation depot; senior centers; a university; museums; and more than 100,000 residents with an influx of tens of thousands of tourists and visitors to the community, particularly from May through October. Both precincts lack a sufficient number of permanent officers to address crime, particularly slashing and stabbings, violence on the street, rape and sexual assault, and gang activities as well as quality of life issues. There has been a vast increase of quality-of-life complaints documented by 311 calls, which include noise, loud music, loitering, car break-ins and vandalism, graffiti on private and public property; large crowds in our parks; illegal Fourth of July fireworks which last for several days before and after the holiday; groups of homeless men intimidating neighborhood residents both on the street and in the subways; and illegal parking. Community District 12 urges the City of New York to provide a an additional 30 police officers for both the 34th and 33rd Precincts as well as provide them with additional transportation equipment, including patrol cars and ATVs so that they may adequately protect and serve the community. A command post set up near the Dyckman Street area will enable officers to respond to 911 and 311 calls at the end of the precinct in a more timely and efficient manner. In order for complete transparency, we are requesting that all uniformed patrol officers and supervisors be allocated body cams. With the increased technology, we request that Spotshotter be implemented in both precincts in order to ascertain where shots are fired, aiding the NYPD in reducing gun violence. Finally, being the geographic territory of Community Board 12 is particularly vast, we urge the City of New York to provide the 33rd and 34th Precincts with a significant closed circuit camera and lighting budget, so that they can keep track of troubled areas as well as focus on preventative issues, all while using the latest technology available, without sacrificing human resources on the ground, which could instead be used for urgent responses by law enforcement. ","Our local firehouses participate in many community wide events. However, more educational initiatives are requested to best education the public and provide outreach in terms of fire safety, recruiting, illegal fireworks, smoke detectors, and other issues important to the safety of residents and businesses. Firehouses have been renovated and are in excellent shape, except for two which require the replacement of apparatus doors. A relatively new EMS base, circa 2013, has been existing in temporary modular buildings also known as trailers; a permanent building is much preferred and requested.","","","","","Air quality and pollution","","The initial findings of the New York City Community Air Survey showed that Washington Heights is one of the most polluted areas in the City, apparently because of the huge amount of traffic coming through the community on the Trans Manhattan Expressway and the concentration of apartment buildings burning dirty fuel oil.","The water and sewer pipes in our district are very old and are collapsing very often.  This condition is shown on the increasing numbers of sink holes and cave in holes all over the district.  We have reported in the past two years several dozen of sink holes and cave in on Post Ave., Cooper Street, West 181st Street among other.  Our catch basins are clogged causing a lot of floods with heaving rains.  There is a very bad flood location at Dyckman Street, Nagle Ave and Fort George Hill.  There are also locations that do not have enough catch basin or do not have catch basin at all like the northeast corner of West 166th and Amsterdam Ave.  Community Board 12 supports the following actions to improve the environment of our community:  • Aggressive outreach efforts by the Bureau of Pest Control to reduce rat infestation in our community, which was cited as having the highest rate of rat infestation in Manhattan in 2011.  • Restoration of funding for Manhattan’s only lead-safe house, operated by the Northern Manhattan Improvement Corp. at 2183 Amsterdam Ave.  This facility is a vital resource for families with lead-poisoned children whose apartments are undergoing lead abatement.  • Increased funding for public education and outreach on disposal of household garbage and recyclables.  • Due to Northern Manhattan becoming a destination for dining and entertainment the number of pedestrian traffic has increased dramatically we need more litter baskets on our streets to mitigate the overflow of litter baskets on our streets.    • The hiring of additional Sanitation workers, including street cleaners and Sanitation police officers, for Community District 12.  • The construction of a Sanitation garage for Manhattan Community District 8 so that its collection trucks will no longer make thousands of unnecessary trips through our community every year in violation of the City Charter co-terminality mandate.  • The use of cleaner, less polluting fuel oil in apartment buildings, local businesses and large institutions to reduce a major source of pollution in the community.  • Stronger and consistent enforcement of the Noise Control Code throughout the community, especially late at night in connection with bars and restaurants.  • Comprehensive regulations and policy for the placement of cell phone towers on residential buildings that protect public health and safety and u","• Increased funding for public education and outreach on disposal of household garbage and recyclables.  • Due to Northern Manhattan becoming a destination for dining and entertainment the number of pedestrian traffic has increased dramatically we need more litter baskets on our streets to mitigate the overflow of litter baskets on our streets.    • The hiring of additional Sanitation workers, including street cleaners and Sanitation police officers, for Community District 12.  • The construction of a Sanitation garage for Manhattan Community District 8 so that its collection trucks will no longer make thousands of unnecessary trips through our community every year in violation of the City Charter co-terminality mandate","","","","","Affordable housing preservation","","CB #12, M requests more funding for the construction of affordable accessible housing for seniors and for the construction of 100% permanent long-term affordable housing units (based on the average median income throughout CB12M) to Non-Profits, Community Land Trusts, and Land Banks that are partnered with non-profit developers.. Housing that is affordable to households within the income-range most representative of the community district is the most important housing issue in Washington Heights and Inwood.  The availability of affordable housing and the availability of sufficient affordable housing to meet local demand constitutes the core of both the physical and the social issues. CD12's  low AMI, compared to city-wide AMI, and the rising cost of living result in high rent burden and over crowding for a significant percentage of households. The existing stock of affordable housing must be kept intact and affordable to the majority of local residents in order for the community to be sustained and enjoy greater access to and benefit from the broader economic and social fabric of the city and the nation.  In addition to the preservation of the existing  affordable housing, we are in need of the construction of new affordable housing and the for these new housing units must be calculated based on the median household income of the residents of Community District 12-Manhattan and not based on the median household income of the residents of Manhattan or the City as a whole.  Furthermore,  the number one issue for the Housing & Human Services committee for the Expense Budget Ranking for Fiscal Year 2024 is to Provide sufficient funding for mandatory “right to counsel” and CBO’s for HOUSING  COURT and the new  Office of Civil Justice to provide legal, social services and or administrative assistance, heavy attorney representation, advocacy or intervention beyond the pro bono or current non-attorney Guardian Ad Litem programs, and one-stop HRA/LINC programs for all tenant litigants in CB12,M. We request funds for additional planning staff to work with CB12M and local residents to formulate and implement a community-based neighborhood preservation and development plan for Washington Heights and Inwood, exclusive of any work undertaken in connection with EDC's Inwood Rezoning plan or other city-sponsored planning or zoning initiatives. As well the allocation of capital funds to support a planning and development initiative for Washington Heights and Inwood that identifies and packages city- and privately-owned vacant sites and buildings in one or more Requests for Proposals for the development of affordable residential projects for which affordability is defined by the average household income of current CD12 residents.","We need additional planning staff to work with CB12M and local residents to formulate and implement a community-based contextual zoning plan for Washington Heights & Inwood. We need to implement a planning and development initiative for Washington Heights & Inwood whereby vacant city-owned lots and buildings are identified, packaged and released in one or more Requests for Proposals dedicated to scattered-site infill residential development that is affordable to local residents of CD12 with affordability defined by the Area Median Income (AMI) of CD12. (HPD), or purchased by the City for such development.   For business development CB #12, M request the expansion of NYC Small Business Support Centers beyond single location. Funding for weather proofing for outdoor dining, safer street initiatives and plaza investement, and the creation of an Iniative within a city agency to faciliate the optimization of outdoor dining areas that adhere to new regulations. Building a Business training/capacitation hubs (additional to services offered by SBS) up to and including personal coaches/ resource navigators ","Community District 12 Manhattan is well known for its pre and post-world war buildings which are in need of much maintenance and repairs. Many of which are not accessible for individuals with disabilities.  As well it holds the most rent regulated apartments in all of Manhattan at 56, 173 rent regulated units.  Within Community District 12 Manhattan there is exist many housing issues where tenants who live in these apartments are faced with deplorable living conditions and serious housing code violations.  This is such a problem that in 2010 and 2011 than The New York City Public Advocate Bill De Blasio now Mayor created the Worst Landlords Watch List, reporting s Manhattan's worst-run down buildings are mostly Harlem, Washington Heights, and Inwood. Forty five of the 56 Manhattan buildings on the list are in those areas     The impact of high rent is felt nationwide, the call for affordability is imperative.  A report created  by Shaun Donovan / Secretary of the U.S Department of housing and Urban Development “Out of Reach 2012 “defined affordability as it is consistent with the federal standard that no more than 30% of a house holds gross income should be spent on gross housing cost and households paying over 30% of their income are considered cost burdened.     The former Mayor of New York Michael Bloomberg’s acknowledged the need d for 165,000 more affordable housing units to be either built or preserved in New York City. However the Mayor’s affordable housing distribution has been grossly uneven, as seen in statistics provided by the Department of Housing Preservation and Development regarding the borough of Manhattan. From 2004 to 2010, 36,271 affordable housing units were built or preserved in Manhattan, but more than two-thirds of this construction was concentrated in just three of Manhattan’s twelve community districts.     Residents in this district are faced with rising rents; overcrowding and physical conditions of existing rent-regulated housing units are often in deplorable, conditions with serious housing code violations. This clearly highlights the needs for more funding our existing housing stock in regard to preservation and new construction of affordable housing.  Another major concern for our community is the need for affordable and accessible housing, since the median house hold income of our residents is 38, 320 and 42.3% of our residents.","Top Priorities for Business Development/Economic Development for CB12M:      1. CB12 needs renovated libraries that can be utilized by residents throughout the district to help prepare for gainful employment, be it to utilize technology to search for jobs, as well as resume building – our libraries are a central resource for all that are being underutilized because of the outdated and run down conditions they are in.  2. Continuation of Annual CB12M Small Business Forum, so as to bring the business community, government and the residents of this district together so business owners can gain valuable information on how to thrive and expand.  3. Continuation of Annual CB12M Jobs Fair, and perhaps as a bi-annual event, so as bring job seekers and employers together and help reduce the systemically high unemployment of CB12M.  4. Establish the committee as a main resource to all current and new local businesses, in an effort to engage in a public/private sector dialogue that helps CB12M residents, business and institutions thrive and expand, as well as providing information to local business as it relates to city, state and federal business oriented initiatives.  5. Incorporating business and the local arts community – with a high storefront vacancy, the committee aims to reduce the blight of vacant store fronts by creating a partnership among landlords and the CB12M arts community, so as to provide expanded arts space while increasing the appeal of venues that may be vacant at the time.  6. Play a critical role with the NYC Economic Development Corporation in the current rezoning efforts within CB12M  7. Strengthening relations with government agencies that assist with small business such as DCA, DEP, and SBS.  8. Partner with restaurants and bars in an effort to ensure friendly balance between nightlife activity and the residential community  9. Host an event for local business and residents that provides commercial real estate and legal training as it relates to commercial leases and rights for all those involved in a commercial lease  10. Creating increased tourism and consumer demand for CB12M business and organizations, through expanded transportation options, including water taxi service to Northern Manhattan.

The Macombs Dam Bridge spans the Harlem River in New York City, connecting the boroughs of Manhattan and the Bronx near Yankee Stadium on West 155th Street.  2. The High Bridge is the oldest bridge in New York City, having originally opened as an aqueduct in 1848 and reopened as a pedestrian walkway in 2015 is connecting Manhattan and the Bronx over the Harlem River on West 173rd Street through the Highbridge Park.  It is expected that bicycle traffic increase on Amsterdam Ave in the near future.  3. The Alexander Hamilton Bridge  connecting the Trans-Manhattan Expressway in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan and the Cross-Bronx Expressway over the Harlem River.  This bridge brings traffic to the Washington Bridge and the West 181st Street and connects to the Henry Hudson Parkway.  4. The Washington Bridge  crosses the Harlem River connecting 181st Street and Amsterdam Avenue in the Washington Heights neighborhood of Manhattan to University Avenue in the Morris Heights neighborhood of the Bronx.  5. The University Heights Bridge crosses the Harlem River, connecting West 207th Street in the Inwood neighborhood of Manhattan to West Fordham Road in the University Heights section of the Bronx.  6. The Broadway Bridge crosses the Harlem River Ship Canal between Inwood on Manhattan Island and Marble Hill in the Bronx.   7. The Henry Hudson Bridge crosses the Spuyten Duyvil Creek. It connects Spuyten Duyvil in the Bronx with Inwood in Manhattan.  8.  George Washington Bridge crosses the Hudson River, connecting the Washington Heights neighborhood in the borough of Manhattan in New York City to Fort Lee, in New Jersey. The George Washington Bridge carries over 106 million vehicles per year, making it the world's busiest motor vehicle bridge according to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.  The approaches to and from the George Washington Bridge in Washington Heights are very congested at all time of the day getting worse during the pick hours.  9.  Amsterdam Ave., Audubon Ave., Wadsworth Ave., St. Nicholas Ave., Broadway and Ft. Washington Ave. between West 178th and West 179th Street are overpasses over the Trans Manhattan Expressway.  These overpasses are in disrepair because in order for NYC DOT to pave them with their actual equipment they will be required to shut down completely the Trans Manhattan Express way.  For these reasons our Traffic & Transportation Committee added a new request for Expense 2018 Fiscal Year Budget to Allocate funds to purchase light paving equipment (rollers 4-6 foot, milling machines, APM Paver Machines) suitable  to be used on bridges and overpasses.","No comments","","","","","Park access and park facility access","","CB #12, M would like to request in FY24, to increase Parks Dept. funding to support additional programming throughout CD12 parks, playgrounds, courts: fund additional Playground Associates, Maintenance/Operations Workers, Gardeners, Forestry, & GreenThumb staff, Urban Park Rangers, Parks Enforcement Patrol, and to provide recreational, waterfront, afterschool, environmental/conservation and cultural programming for kids, teens, adults, seniors, and the formerly incarcerated or institutionalized, and the addition of  ADA-compliant bathroom in Javits Playground(DPR)","With well over 600 acres of park land it is no surprise that fully 15 of CB12M's capital budget priorities (plus 5 continuing support items) are for projects in and around our parks. Many of the projects are for ADA retrofitting, or for repairs to update aging infrastructure.  There are additional capital and expense needs relating to youth programming in parks, waterfront recreation development and other items which, while important, were beyond the OMB-imposed limit of 40 capital project and 25 expense programs.    The Audubon Playground is in a section of CD12M with relatively few parks/playgrounds, yet there is a school serving citywide DoE needs situated in the playground. We would like that ""temporary"" structure (built decades ago) removed and the area returned to community use as a recreational facility.     Ongoing maintenance of parks pathways, particularly in our largest parks -- Fort Tryon, Highbridge, and Inwood Hill -- is the single most important way to ensure safe access to all parts of our parks, both for recreation as well as for maintenance, safety, and access.     The Msgr. Kett playground is in a part of Inwood not otherwise served by playgrounds nearby, despite being close to a public housing project. It hasn't been renovated since the '90's and is long overdue. Additionally, the basketball courts are heavily used by the community, and are in need of repair.     Many areas within our parks, playgrounds and dog runs need plumbing and/or lighting, for the benefit of parks users, as well as for use by landscaping staff. Areas in need include Ft. Tryon Park's Alpine Garden along the eastern/Broadway slope, and the dog run; the Riverside Park dog run at W. 165th Street, the ""Sunken"" Playground in Highbridge Park in lower the 160s, and the basketball/tennis courts in Inwood Hill Park.    ADA compliance and retrofit projects include: the historic Morris-Jumel Mansion, the Dyckman Farmhouse, the High Bridge Water Tower, Highbridge Park's New Adventure Playground (W. 165th & Edgecombe), restrooms throughout the District's Parks, and the Hispanic Society of America.     Additional ongoing/recurring requests include the Phase II restoration of the High Bridge water tower (e.g., stairs, pointing, windows and carillon); expansion of free public WiFi in our parks; and funding of Phase II of the New York Restoration Project's clean-up and waterfront access at Sherman Creek. As a new request we would like to see the addition of a science barge to meet the educational needs of CD12M's youth and adults alike, in a creative way that also utilizes our vast waterfront.     On the expense side, CD12M parks are in desperate need of more maintenance and enforcement personnel. While there is much excellent programming of all kinds, our wealth of facilities could be leveraged to greater use with additional programming targeted to youth, seniors, teens. Given our income thresholds and levels of poverty, which are well below borough averages, CD12M is particularly in need of free or low-cost recreation and educational offerings.","CB12M has a wealth of cultural facilities and programs, but many are in need of accessibility improvements, major capital repairs, and additional program offerings for our community. In particular, afterschool programming and educational/cultural programming at museums & historic houses (e.g. Hispanic Society, Morris- Jumel Mansion, Dyckman Farmhouse, etc.)    Northern Manhattan also is in desperate need of accessible performance and gallery space, rehearsal space, and infrastructure to support a growing arts community and audience for performance and displayed art. There is no prioritized capital item for this as there is no identified lead agency or specific funding project, but the absence of this resource is a recurring trope at community meetings and events; as such, it is appropriate to note it in our Statement of District Needs.","The existing library facilities are in disrepair and need to be renovated and make it accessible in some cases.  CB #12, M need more libraries; therefore, the construction of more libraries facilities are required.  The budget for the libraries were increased recently.  We request that this increase is maintained and expanded.","Under the NYC Charter, Community Boards have a great deal of responsibilities.  Community Board have a limited budget resulting in limited staff.  CB #12, M has only three staff members including the District Manager.  With three staff members CB #12, covers the office operation, all the community needs, Board members demands and night meeting coverage, processing of vendor’s payments and the Comptroller’s audits. With the sophistication of technology there are new demand that sometime is not possible to accomplish because of the lack of training on the staff or the lack of personnel to perform it.  The members of Community Board #12, M demand the presence of a staff for the night’s meetings.  We have at least ten night meetings per month.  The night meetings start at 7 pm and finish around 10 pm.  Some meetings, like the Licensing Committee finish close to might night.  The Licensing Committee meeting in the month of June went up to the next day, the meeting was adjourned at 1:30 am but the agenda was not completed.

We service the communities of Astoria and portions of East Elmhurst, Long Island City, Woodside and Jackson Heights. Our zoning is mixed with residential, manufacturing, industrial and commercial areas, two (2) Industrial Zones, and two (2) Business Improvement Districts. Our district is home to four (4) NYCHA housing developments. We have major shopping, dining and business areas along Broadway, Ditmars Boulevard, Steinway Street, 30th and 36th Avenues and Northern Boulevard. CD1 has seen a boom in development and studies to prepare for the future of land use in our boundaries is necessary. The District abuts LaGuardia Airport, along with several major roads that provide access through our community to and from Manhattan via the Queens Borough Bridge, Brooklyn via the BQE and the Bronx via the RFK/Triborough Bridge. CD1, Queens also provide the only land access to Rikers and Roosevelt Islands. District 1, Queens is home to the largest number of energy power plants that provide electricity to all of New York City. We have genuine concerns regarding respiratory health in our district and advocate for air monitoring. We are also concerned due to the recent installation of 5G antennas and the possible health ramifications and are requesting monitoring within our boundaries of (EMF) electro-magnetic frequency. We are the most culturally diversified District in New York City with 119 different nationalities and counting. Our community has many desirable qualities, including the beautiful waterfront, cultural establishments such as the Museum of the Moving Image, the Noguchi Museum, Socrates Sculpture Park and a replica of an ancient Greek Amphitheater at Athens Square. We are home to the Kaufman Astoria Studios, the Arts District and one of the largest film and television production centers on the east coast. We will soon be welcoming an additional film studio complex, Wildflower, into our district. Programing for the arts and culture is important to our community. In May of 2016, District 1 welcomed the opening of Mount Sinai Hospital of Queens' additional building. This is the only hospital serving our community including the areas of Roosevelt Island and Rikers Island in critical, life saving time. Funding for life saving programs and equipment are always welcome and necessary for the quality patient care of our ever-growing community the pandemic proved this fact. Our District has the greatest number of Enclosed and Unenclosed Sidewalk Cafes in Queens. The Board appreciates the ambiance that these cafes bring to our community and we realize that the quality-of-life of our residents must be maintained. We look to NYC Agency support for proper enforcement of rules and regulations. Currently, Queens County has the greatest number of trees of all the boroughs. Our District has numerous parks and recreation areas with Astoria Park being the crown jewel of our community. At the present time, CD1,Q is in an upward transition and development of new housing is at an all-time high and the infrastructure will soon require upgrades at all levels. We require affordable housing with supporting infrastructure and maintenance of green space. Furthermore, we require the area median income (AMI) to reflect the incomes of our District to avoid displacement in the future. Our Board has seen the addition of Citi Bike, the NYC Ferry, Revel Mopeds, Lime Electric Scooters and Car-Share programs to our districts transportation system. We have had elevators installed by MTA at the Astoria Boulevard train station for access to the elevated train line. We anticipate the addition of other elevators locally. In addition, we look forward to the benefits from the modernization of LaGuardia Airport and the opportunities Cornell Tech Center will provide to our community. Employment opportunities and training are essential to residents. We look forward to a ""silicon alley"" within our boundaries. We also look forward to the employment opportunities this addition could provide due to the proximity of the Tech Center. Respectfully submitted, Marie Torniali, Chairperson & Florence Koulouris, District Manager ","","","","","Affordable Housing","","AFFORDABLE HOUSING- The need for affordable housing in our district has produced a market for illegal apartment conversion. It has long been the Board's opinion that legislation should be considered to legalize apartments that meet all safety regulations. This will provide safe affordable housing and add to the City's tax base. Increased rents for those living on a fixed income are forcing many seniors and disable residents to move from their homes and out our community.  A community that they have lived in for many years, some a lifetime. Truly affordable housing needs to be an option. With development the Area Median Income (AMI) needs to be re-evaluated so residents may stay within their communities. A realistic look at the income of our residents verses the projected AMI requires a study. Additional senior housing is necessary with the exponential growth of the senior population.  There is simply not enough housing for those in need of senior residents.","Police-community relations","","POLICE-COMMUNITY RELATIONS- Residential development has increased tremendously in our District impacting on all services, particularly the Police. We have an increase in night life, with approximately 160 establishments in our District and growing, that impacts on the quality of life in each neighborhood and in the surrounding communities. We urge the enforcement of regulations pertaining to clubs, lounges and bars i.e.: excessive noise, drugs and alcohol service to minors. The MARCH Program (Multi Agency Response to Club Hotspots) must be continued. Businesses and residents deserve the opportunity of peaceful enjoyment in their community. Nightlife should not dominate our police officers' services. Quality of life matters for residents.","Other - Write In (Required)","","Transit & Traffic - CD1Q acknowledges the need for safe passages of cyclists through the City which we support.  We also have serious concerns regarding the elimination of parking spaces, particularly in our commercial and professional areas. This creates a hardship for the business that need parking to accommodate patrons and supplies. New developments have brought more residents who depend on public transportation. In addition, many commuters from outside the area drive to Astoria and park their cars to board the train to Manhattan and other boroughs because they do not have service. This brings individuals into our district where inevidably spend money in our various establishment and creates economic stimulus. There is now extreme over crowding in our district. We have had the installation of Cars to go, Citi Bike, the Ferry service, and Revel Vespa's to aid in transportation options. However, the mass transportation system requires massive service upgrades to accommodate todays magnitude of travelers. We require a better plan to accommodate our districts diverse needs and volume which will provide opportunity to our residents.  Transportation should not cause the hardship it does to so many. Our district requires a solid mass transportation plan that will provide safe, accessible and affordable travel to all of our neighbors.

The district is bounded on the north by Queens Plaza North, the northern property line of the Sunnyside Rail Yard and Northern Boulevard; on the east by the ConRail Property; on the south by Calamus, Maurice and Maspeth Avenues and Newtown Creek; on the west by the East River.  Community Board 2 has a wide variety of residential housing options, including one, two, and three family private homes, two primarily residential landmark districts: Sunnyside Gardens Historic District and the Hunter's Point Historic District, and a wealth of multifamily apartment options, including the burgeoning new communities in Long Island City: Hunters Point South, Queens West and Court Square, coined the fastest growing neighborhoods in the nation. In recent years, this new high-rise residential development has been extended east to sites along both Queens Boulevard and Roosevelt Avenue in Sunnyside and Woodside. Finally, in LIC are also communities zoned for manufacturing only, like Blissville, containing manufacturing and grandfathered homes. Today, Blissville houses our most vulnerable in permanent homeless shelters and converted hotels. CB2 is home to: an emerging 21st century economy and an active Industrial Business Zone (IBZ) and Newtown Creek which is a significant, maritime, and industrial area (SMIA) dedicated to preserving manufacturing and industry in NY. A vibrant arts community including PS1 Contemporary Art Museum, LaGuardia Performing Arts Center, CultureLab LIC, Thalia Hispanic Theatre, the Turkish Cultural Center, Ecuadorian American Cultural Center, Topaz Arts, and Silvercup Studios. A robust higher educational facility, LaGuardia Community College, that in 2019 enrolled over 30,000 students from 150 nations. Several thriving areas of small businesses and manufacturers, including 2 (?) IBZ districts. These segments of CB2 are critical to the entire city's economy and are vulnerable to zoning changes and rising rents. CB2 is served by many dedicated community-based nonprofits. The Long Island City Partnership and the Sunnyside Business Improvement District both work to improve and enhance commercial districts. Sunnyside Community Services, Woodside on the Move, Hunters Point Park Conservancy, Court Square Civic Association, Blissville Civic Association and Catholic Migration Services serve families most in need and work to enrich and preserve quality of life for residents. Access by mass transit to various locations in CB2 include the #7, E, M, F, G, N, W, R subway lines and many bus lines. A rapidly growing network of bicycle lanes supports commuters throughout the district.  However, there are neighborhoods within our district who remain in a transportation desert such as the Blissville section of Long Island City, Wynwood Gardens in Woodside, parts of Maspeth and the far reaches of Hunter's Point South. ","","","","","Land use trends","","A.	Rezoning CB2 has experienced record real estate development and exponential population growth over the past two decades. Rezoning, particularly in Long Island City and along Queens Boulevard, that originally aimed toward commercial growth, poorly anticipated the residential boom and the pressure this has placed on every aspect of the community's needs. Residential real estate development has outpaced the provision of essential services, upkeep of the infrastructure, schools, roads, transit, and open space. Rezoning in Sunnyside and Woodside along Queens Boulevard that incentivized additional floor area ratio (FAR) to provide optional affordable housing through  the City's initial Inclusionary Housing Program has failed to produce many new affordable apartments for existing residents in the District. (One recent Zoning Text Amendment in Woodside includes Mandatory Inclusionary Housing, but those units have not yet been constructed.) Rent levels of 130% AMI, which are most commonly offered in privately financed MIH buildings, are unaffordable to those local residents most in need, and do little to alleviate the housing crisis.  An exception is a building on Barnett Ave which has been approved, and will have 100% affordable units, ranging from 30 to 80% AMI. CB2 is disappointed that we have not seen any signs of construction for over one year.  In the last few years, multiple individual sites along Roosevelt Avenue and between Roosevelt and Queens Boulevard have been subject to developer initiated-rezoning to enable new high-rise residential or mixed-use construction, typically much higher than the surrounding residential and commercial fabric. This increased density is not accompanied by substantive city or developer financed improvements in infrastructure, particularly transit, public green spaces, and public school capacity, which are already overburdened. Also lacking, particularly in Woodside, are improvements to the existing streetscapes. A more comprehensive and coordinated plan for Roosevelt Avenue, in lieu of the ongoing but haphazard rezoning, is badly needed in this part of the CB2 district. In Hunters point, there is pressure to increase housing along the waterfront and into the IBZ. Public investments in resiliency, sustainability, and infrastructure repairs need to come first. Small businesses and the creative community have been deeply impacted by prior zoning. Any future zoning must make preservation of the existing economy the number one priority before favoring new business development.  B.	Rising Housing Costs Rising housing costs have become a destabilizing factor. Long time renters are being displaced by increased housing costs. Small homeowners – many on fixed incomes – have experienced large property tax increases. The cost of local retail, including basics such as food and other groceries, have significantly risen. Very few working classes, public employees, or small business owners can afford to buy property. Many properties that come on the market are available as knockdowns for development or for speculation. Those that are retained are modernized with an eye toward an upscale market (the previous owners often having previously neglected the property's condition).  1.	Affordable housing   CB2 is seeking a significant number of additional units of affordable housing, ideally for both rental and homeownership, and expanded opportunities for low- and moderate-income residents already living in the community. In addition, renters and homeowners will continue to need housing counseling assistance to preserve and protect their homes in the district. Repair of the existing infrastructure, notably sewers, and resiliency measures must come first and be based on the most current scientific evidence and recommendations.  2.	Sheltered and Unhoused Individuals and Families  Community Board 2 has experienced an increase of homelessness within our district during the past few years. And, more recently, during the COVID-l9 emergency, the temporary shelter population in CB2 and adjacent CB1 has spiked. Individuals facing these circumstances can be found in clusters within the district. Some of the more noticeable include encampments behind Big Bush Park, under the elevated #7 subway stations in Sunnyside and Woodside, including the 61st Street MTA/LIRR ticket booth areas as well as under overpasses along the BQE near Laurel Hill Boulevard. Increased crucial services for our most vulnerable homeless residents and homeless service providers are needed to support these vulnerable New Yorkers, especially now, with anew influx of asylum seekers.   According to DHS as of October 2022, CB2 is home to six shelters with a total of 548 residents. These include two permanent shelters, the Metro Family Shelter in Woodside, and the North Star Shelter in Blissville and 4 temporary shelters (two of which are in Blissville). We support our unhoused neighbors and the right to shelter, and we are deeply concerned that there are no sufficient resources to support these vulnerable populations. Blissville is zoned Industrial/Manufacturing and lacks basic services such as green space, supermarkets, laundry facilities and schools as well as limited public transportation options and adjacent to one of our Nation’s largest Superfund sites. Additionally, the identification of sites and resettling of unhoused families in the temporary shelters, especially in Blissville, has been disorganized and disruptive to the residents and the community in and around Blissville. Furthermore, the recent sharp increase in asylum seekers has caused New York City to experience a corresponding explosion in housing needs, with now around 11,000 individuals having entered New York City’s shelter system since May 2022.  The City must seek and allocate sufficient resources to ensure that housing sites have security plans and supportive services; that permanent housing programs are adequately funded; and that local nonprofits, which will inevitably be tasked with helping these individuals, receive the support they need to do so.  C. Rapidly increasing commercial rents.  The district has a wealth of small and large manufacturers, tech companies, design firms, retail, and service industries that innovate and provide jobs. Many have been part of the community for decades. Some are new. All experience the exceptional pressure of rapidly rising rents, resulting in higher failure rates, turnover, layoffs, and unemployment. Often, zoning allows former manufacturing lots to be replaced by housing, which further exacerbates the ongoing problems. Zoning has also allowed existing space appropriate for small manufacturers to be replaced by higher cost office space that is not suited for industry. Investment and dedication of assets to attract and support new business growth must be matched by the same investment and support for existing small business.  D. Impact on artists.  Community Board 2 has been home to a vast community of creative individuals and groups who have given the area much of its unique identity and being an important sector for economic growth. PS1 / MoMa is a prime example of how a fledgling space for artist studios evolved into a world-class museum that provides a wide range of jobs, artist opportunities, and tourism revenue. An important synergy exists between local businesses, manufacturers, and artisans – each able to share unique capabilities and ideas, where the economic whole becomes greater than the sum. Our district is home to professional dancers, actors, composers, writers, and musicians who work in a professional capacity while innovating and experimenting on their own. This creative sector is among the most immediately threatened populations in the district. Zoning has allowed existing productive space to be replaced by space more suited for new and often speculative ventures, while permanently eliminating the community that has played a major role in placing the district on the map. We need a community center that facilitates the incubation and support of these artists who define the character of the district.   E. Neighborhood Preservation   Support is needed to sustain the existing infrastructure, maintain our scarce resources of public and open space and support our diverse community of homeowners, renters, families, seniors, immigrants, workers, school children, businesses, and artists while seeking to pursue important housing, economic development and land use challenges of the post-COVID 19 eras. Our budget requests are informed by the basic necessity to preserve, protect and expand housing and economic opportunity without compromising the quality, services, and economy of existing neighborhoods of CB2.  There are multiple overlapping aspects we see as part and parcel of neighborhood preservation. Older established neighborhoods are experiencing destabilizing levels of density and displacement and diminished services. Newer neighborhoods are having difficulty becoming and sustaining as neighborhoods because costs encourage higher turnover.  Basic services and entities part of an organically evolved community do not exist.","Parks and open space","","Parks, Culture & Other Community Facilities, especially those communities within our district absent Parks, Playgrounds and Greenspace and remain part of the 1% of NYC residents who must walk greater than 20 minutes to reach a park or greenspace.    ","Other - Write In (Required)","","Environmental  Issues:  The inadequately addressed challenges of climate change include sea level rise of particular concern for the district's vast waterfront. As current information is compiled, we learn that the inland effects are potentially greater than understood even in recent planning, which has been exacerbated by the lack of public green space, for example only 29% of LIC’s population live within a 5 minute walk to a green space and there is only .4 acres of green space per 1,000 residents compared to 2.5 acres citywide. Other environmental issues that stem from overdevelopment a lack of comprehensive planning include poor air quality from traffic congestion, rats from excavation including a lack of street cleaning in large parts of the District, the ongoing LIRR Borden Avenue train yard diesel fume air pollution from idling trains, and continual dust, debris, and contaminants in the air from construction sites.   From NYCAS 2019 data, Long Island City has an average of 8.0 PM2.5 particles compared to 6.5 through Queens and 6.6 Citywide. Woodside/Sunnyside has even worse air quality at 8.4 PM 2.5, which health studies have shown long term exposure leads to increased rates of chronic bronchitis, reduced lung function and increased mortality from lung cancer and heart disease, in particular affecting the young and elderly. CB2 would like to see a greater prioritization of Public EV Chargers within the District given the unproportional cost to adverse air quality within our neighborhoods to the rest of the City.   Combined sewage runoffs, in particular when it rains, create billions of gallons of waste overflow into local waterways throughout Newtown Creek and the East River. Although new City rules require new developments to retain significant amounts of rainwater on site, using tools such as green roofs and porous pavements, climate change has exacerbated and accelerated more frequent rain storms and flash flooding, worsening existing conditions.   Storm surge and rain events have created threats to health, safety, and even lives. New buildings and those in the pipeline  have been addressing these issues with insufficient and outdated approaches that generally only protect their own buildings and add to area wide negative impact.     ","","","","","Health facilities","","Despite the significant population growth of the District, the area and in particular Western Queens continues to lack primary care medical facilities and outpatient clinics. Our families have to travel out of the district for public pediatric and maternity care. With one of the largest populations of senior citizens, CB2 needs additional support for senior services and modern, full-service senior center facilities. We’d request the City explore a study to expand the City run hospital (NYC Health + Hospitals) location to CB2 District and/or incentivize a private facility to come to the area.   During the COVID 19 emergency, it has become evident that food insecurity is a problem for families and seniors. While nonprofits organizations and volunteers have pitched in during the crisis, CB2 requests that the City administration support the efforts of volunteers by establishing a public food pantry in CB2, or partner with existing efforts from organizations such as Mosaic Church.  B.	Healthcare outreach During the pandemic our ability to reach homebound community members was severely curtailed.  This was especially concerning when it came to vaccination.  We must act proactively to find ways to protect these residents and their caregivers.  C. Healthcare Accessibility There is a severe present need for access to existing hospitals beyond the district. Concurrent with the request to expand City run hospitals to CB2 district we ask the City to explore establishing a ferry route to the Manhattan East Side hospitals.","No comments ","CB2 is the home to one of the largest populations of senior citizens.

According to NYC Department of City Planning (DCP), 40% of residents 5 years or older have limited English proficiency  as  compared  to 29% in Queens and  23% in NYC overall. English as a Second Language (ESL) programs such as those provided by Sunnyside Community Services need to be protected and adequately funded. There is also a need throughout the CB district for publicly accessible locations for youth and child welfare service.  The construction of schools and provision  of youth services, such as Summer Youth Employment Programs, have lagged behind  the  population growth in CB2,  particularly  in Long Island City. The 2018 Economic Development Corporation (EDC) LIC Investment Strategy publication included a goal to, ""expeditiously, bring online pipeline projects to meet the current needs for additional school seats while also planning for additional population growth and future needs"". EDC identified a need for $60M for the construction of a  school in the Court Square neighborhood  within School District 30, for which a site has still not been identified or built, despite efforts by the School Construction Authority. In addition,  corollary youth services, a multi-service youth center, early child education and a Beacon School should be identified. In UC, the city owned Department of Education building could serve as a venue for youth and community service.

Important as are the police for public safety, it is recognized that many functions traditionally assigned to the police can and should be accomplished through alternative services.  For example, street safety can be promoted by roadway re-design and automated enforcement.  Further, we seek meaningful in person community policing.  We’d like to see police regularly on foot or on bikes.  We like to see a transformation of their ethos from the current situation where they are “officers” with military ranks and the rest of the community are “civilians.” Human service professionals are needed to actively engage in policing operations and not just to provide training for police in community engagement, domestic violence, mental illness sensitivity training.

Sewer infrastructure-Deteriorating sewer infrastructure in Long Island City is legendary for insufficient capacity. In 2018 EDC LIC Investment Strategy included primary goal to ""improve water and sewer infrastructure to strengthen current service and enhance resiliency infrastructure"" and $95M was proposed to implement a first phase of sewer upgrades and complete the LIC amended drainage plan (ADP). CB2 agrees and requests that the City administration upholds this priority to complete the ADP and implement the first phase of sewer upgrades. CB2 also recommends that large impermeable surfaces be redesigned to reduce runoff into the sewer system utilizing permeable pavers and green infrastructure. B.Air quality-LIRR has major facilities in CB2, including the massive Sunnyside Yards and the Borden Avenue rail yard for its double decker trains. The double decker trains are diesel fueled and their engines are operated 24-hours a day, including when parked in Borden Avenue yard. These create constant air and noise pollution. C.Graffiti tagging of local businesses has increased throughout the district (Blissville/Sunnyside). While volunteers have played a major role in graffiti removal, during the COVID-19 crisis, the City needs to restore and expand programs to remove graffiti. D.Rat infestation is a problem throughout the district due to prevalence of construction. Other hot spots include Greenpoint Avenue in Sunnyside, and between Review and Borden Avenue in Blissville, LIC. E.Litter and dumping of waste throughout district has increased over last few years during COVID crisis. The district needs more and better street trash containers and an increase in frequency and number of street trash collections. F.Sanitation services-DSNY to fund a demonstration project with large community bins to complement or replace curbside services in certain low density residential areas. We seek funding for community pantry gardens which collect organic waste for composting and soil enrichment. Projects like this build community connectedness and, hence, resilience. G.Public space (non-street) snow removal. Snow is typically not removed from sidewalks adjacent to parks, creating pedestrian hazards especially in parks adjacent to transit stops. There has been an inadequate response to the removal of snow and ice from fire hydrants, sidewalks and other pedestrian paths throughout the district, particularly at ADA Compliant Pedestrian Ramps. There is pressing need to acquire enough Bobcats and other equipment to clear non-vehicular paths and allocate sufficient personnel and resources to address these dangerous conditions. H.Waterfront Resiliency-Deteriorating bulkheads along Newtown Creek and flooding along East River waterfront. Requesting DCP initiate a comprehensive planning process for development sites on LIC waterfront and Vernon Boulevard corridor community as was promised.","No comments","No comments","","","","","Other - Write In (Required)","","A. One of the critical issues is the availability of truly affordable housing. According to the Partnership for New York City, “Housing affordability posed a challenge before COVID-19 with nearly 40% of metro area residents paying more 30% of their income in rent.” COVID-19 related job losses exacerbate this. In CB2, 43% pay 35% or more of their income on rent,  prompting a call for more affordable housing units for low & moderate income residents in the community. B. Economic development: Prior to the events of 2020, our district needed to revitalize existing storefront businesses, small manufacturers, creative individuals and organizations. High rents and commercial conversions have put pressure on small businesses, reducing growth and job opportunities. The pandemic created substantial job loss and forced some businesses to close entirely. The City's economic strategy should shift focus to support existing small businesses, providing funds for employee rehiring, training, ongoing costs, and enhancing commercial strip visibility. The LIC Partnership and Sunnyside Shines Business Improvement District (BID) supports businesses in their geography, but more needs to be done, especially in Woodside and Sunnyside, to help small storefront businesses grow in CB2.  Rezoning in industrial business zones (IBZ) needs careful consideration to protect existing businesses. C. Land use actions increase density, but have not been adequately paired with upgrades to parks, libraries, schools, and especially water and sewage infrastructure. Luxury developments in areas like Long Island City create a tax burden for existing property owners, contributing to the pricing out of residents. Responsible development must address resource limits, climate change, and the need for diverse housing. D. The community, known for welcoming newcomers, faces challenges in supporting asylum seekers, particularly in areas like Blissville and Long Island City lacking essential businesses. The influx further strains resources, emphasizing the need for domestic support services, including supermarkets, laundry facilities, green grocers, and gyms.","CB2 is seeking EDC funds to develop open accessible space on EDC property in area north of 44th Drive, west of Department of Education building and east of the east river.

The quarantine has reinforced the need for good ventilation, open space, clean air to enable safe supports that bind the community together.   Long Island City is known as the fastest growing neighborhood in the country and it also has the lowest ratio of people to open space. The overdevelopment of the area in a relatively short period of time has left  the  Hunters Point, Dutch Kills,  and Court Square neighborhoods  at  a severe deficit.   Court Square was initially re-zoned for commercial development however, commercial development did not occur at the pace predicted and instead residential development has exploded. This neighborhood lacks sufficient open space and schools needed to accommodate this growth. Existing publicly owned spaces such as the LIC Underline or Ramps Public Space should be expanded for public community use.   Although Blissville is primarily an industrial and manufacturing  area, there is a core of group residents totaling over 1,000 that live there - some for generations - along with a cluster of shelters (1 permanent and 2 commercial hotels) housing our most vulnerable population of sheltered homeless. Residents of this community have been seeking to work with the city to identify recreational park space for many years. Recently the addition of the Kosciuszko Bridge pedestrian/bike path has led to a request for the City to do a feasibility study of creating a pedestrian and bicycle greenway and park benches along Review Avenue between Laurel Hill (Kosciuszko Bridge) and the Greenpoint Avenue Bridge.  Similar concerns apply to other areas south of Queens Boulevard and those sections of Maspeth and Woodside which have little or no park and community gathering space.    In addition to the Blissville Greenway; the City should consider how to support the creation of the Dutch Kills Loop.    Greenspace maintenance and development  Parts of the district have historic and prized tree canopies.  However, many of these trees in CB2 have fallen or been removed because of decay, which can and have become dangerous to residents and property. Accordingly, we support funding for continued tree planting and care of existing trees, including new and replacement street trees in CB2 District.","","No comments","CB2 is welcoming the new Hunters Point South Library that has been in the pipeline for a while.

Community Board 3's goal is to enhance the quality of life for all its residents from our very young to seniors. Community Board 3 is comprised of the neighborhoods of East Elmhurst, Jackson Heights, and  North Corona bounded by the Brooklyn- Queens Expressway to the west, Grand Central Parkway to the north, Flushing Meadow Corona Park to the east, and Roosevelt Avenue to the south. The district encompasses zip codes 11368, 11369, 11370, and 11372. CB3's land area is 3.0 square miles and is serviced by the 115th Police Precinct; Sanitation Queens West 3; Fire Engine Company 307/Ladder 154 and Engine Company 316;  23 Public schools; 11 private and parochial schools; 2 post-secondary degree-granting institutions; 4 public libraries; 1 private library; 28 Day Care/ Head Start facilities; 11 known mental health facilities; 12 residences that provide services for individuals with developmental disabilities;  11 shelters; 9 park/playgrounds; 1 vest-pocket park; 7 sitting areas; 8 park strips, 2 Dog Parks, Diversity Plaza, Travers Park has incorporated 78th Street Play Street in its expansion of the facility,  Fisher Pool and Malcolm X  Promenade.   The district lies in the shadow of La Guardia Airport, where some of its residents are employed. Airport-related uses along a portion of its northernmost street Ditmars Boulevard, are evident with the presence of hotels such as the Marriott Hotel,  La Guardia Plaza,  National Car Rental maintains a major facility, and the Vaughn College- School of Aeronautics is in the vicinity. Our major shopping districts and commercial corridors are located along Roosevelt Avenue on the southern boundary of the district; Astoria Boulevard on the northern boundary; 37th Avenue, Northern Boulevard, 73 Street; 74th Street, 82nd Street, 90th Street, Junction Boulevard, 103rd Street. The district's showplaces within the M-1 zone are the Bulova Corporate Center, and Home Depot.   There are a many notable sites located within the confines of the district to name a couple ; the Jackson Heights Historic District, America's first planned ""garden city"" and the Louis Armstrong House/Museum, a national landmark in North Corona.  Community Board 3 is densely populated and probably the most diverse community on the planet. According to NYU Furman Center, 62.8% of our population is foreign-born and most of our citizens originate from Latin America. Over Forty-Eight percent (48.8 %) of these residents have limited English proficiency in contrast to the Borough which is at 28.89% and the City of New York at 23.1%.  More services for these constituents are critically needed. The Census reports that our population is 178,022, which means that our numbers have increased since the 2000 census. It is widely known, however, that New York was severely under-counted in the last census. We, therefore, believe that NYU Furman Center's single-year indicator which projects our population to be at 185,815 is probably a more accurate count.    While there are three distinct neighborhoods, North Corona, East Elmhurst, and Jackson Heights in Queens Community Board 3, we are all working towards a common goal to improve the quality of life for our families and community.   We, therefore, continue to advocate for our top priorities:   	Construct a New Hospital in East Elmhurst, North Corona, 	Build a New High School  at the stalled construction site at 112- 51 Northern Boulevard, 	Clean-Up Flushing Bay and Implement the Army Core of Engineers Recommendations,  	Expand the Capacity of the Jackson Heights Library    	Corona Library  Construct a Library north of Northern Blvd. 	Affordable Housing - 	Reconstruct/Repair Sewers to Alleviate Backups and Flooding 	  Construct an Intergenerational Facility in Jackson Heights  	 Increase  Youth Programs  Increase Senior Programs 	   Expand Medical Services at the Corona Health Center 	 Increase Police Personnel at the 115th Precinct.  	 Conduct a Commercial District Needs Assessment 	 Construct a Performance Arts Center   	Increase the Capacity of Elmhurst Hospital.        ","","","","","Affordable Housing",""," Affordable Housing   While there is housing construction all over the district, very few of the developments are intended for low to middle-income families. These past three years have had a devastating impact on our district particularly as it relates to affordable housing.  Long before the pandemic  there was a shortage of affordable housing crisis . Illegal unsafe conversions and residents  doubling and tripling up in apartments  have increased. It is because residents cannot afford the high rents. By the same token some landlords have not received their  rent in some cases for several years.  To add to the mix, some unscrupulous landlords are forcing poor families out of their apartments. These residents have fixed incomes and cannot afford high rents.  Many of these residents are seniors and disabled individuals who are part of the impacted group.  The housing court really tells the story; in that there is a disproportionate number of minority low-income and at-risk individuals who fall victim to the situation. Many of these tenants  cannot afford an attorney and end up losing their homes. The New York Furman Center reports that Queens  Community Board 3 ranks number 2 for rent-burdened households and 3rd highest for severe crowding of rental units citywide.  According to the report, more than 53.3% of our population pay 35% or more of their income for rent.  In addition, 25.5% of our residents live below the poverty level and for some permanent housing is not a given. The pandemic exacerbated the problem, for many families each month is  a struggle, they must make the difficult decision as to whether to pay the rent or forgo other essential needs. Every month, they are at risk of  being  evicted and homeless.  Affordable housing is one of our top concerns. We believe that housing is a right and a fundamental need that must be addressed.  We, therefore, call upon the City of New York to do more to keep our most vulnerable populations in their homes. Put systems in place to encourage private developers to construct affordable housing.  Set a plan to encourage landlords to remain in the rent stabilization program. Develop incentives to attract new property owners to participate in rent stabilization. While the rent moratorium is no longer in  place for most people, the city must do all  it can to protect our at risk population until they are able to get on their feet.   The city should continue to advocate for more federal dollars and programs that will help to keep a roof over the heads of our most vulnerable.  The influx of  the newly arrived migrants, underscores the fact that urgent attention must be given to this critical issue.      ","Public health facilities","","Increase the Capacity and the Number of Public Health Facilities In Community Board 3  Jackson Heights and Elmhurst was the epicenter during the pandemic.  Elmhurst Hospital nurses and doctors did a herculean job in saving the lives of Covid-19 victims.   Elmhurst Hospital reports that in the last 7 years the emergency department volumes have increased by 33%. Patient wait time has considerably increased. Expanding the facility would be beneficial and positively enhance service delivery. Additional hospital beds and the expansion of the emergency room are sorely needed.  Elmhurst Hospital is the only medical facility in our immediate area. Four hospitals closed their doors over twenty years, Elmhurst Hospital is now accommodating many of the patients  that  used to go to those closed facilities.  While  Urgent Care facilities are opening around the board area and borough, it does not diminish the fact that more hospitals and the services that they provide are still needed.   To enhance the Elmhurst Hospital's capabilities the following needs are requested: E6 Med-Surge Renovation-	This project will involve the conversion of current administrative space  into a Med-Surge unit to house critically ill patients and patients recovering from surgical procedures.	 Purchase of Surgical Laser -	 Acquiring surgical laser will allow our ENT physicians to perform minimally invasive, highly precise surgeries for a wide range of treatments for diseases of ear/nose/throat. Purchase of Additional da Vinci Surgical Robot	 da Vinci® robotic surgery technology  will allow Elmhurst to perform additional robotic surgeries. Robotic surgeries using the da Vinci system enable faster recovery time for patients. Other benefits include reduced pain, less blood loss, reduced risk of infection or complications and less scarring.	 Remodel  In-patient Units 3rd Floor and 6th Floor.	Elmhurst Hospital would like to add additional new furniture and amenities to inpatient units on floors 3 and 6 of its main building. 	 The aforementioned modifications and additional services will help to better serve the community.    ","Street flooding","","Flooding and Sewer Backups  Many years ago,  flooding and sewer backup conditions were confined to East Elmhurst ,however, currently the condition can occur in any area of the district.  Zip codes11368,11369,1370 and 11372 encompass the neighborhoods of  Jackson Heights, Corona, East Elmhurst, and Woodside. Each area of the district has experienced flooding and sewer backup during heavy rainfalls.   Flooding occurs because our existing combined sewer system does not have the capacity to handle the volume of the incoming water. It was thought that  storms and heavy rains occurred once every hundred years. Due to climate change, however, the incidence of flooding and sewer backups have become more frequent. These events can often cause a lot of damage and loss of life. We call upon our elected officials and DEP to fund the changeout of our existing combined sewer to a dedicated system. Queens Community Board 3 has been advocating for this infrastructure upgrade for more than thirty years.    ","","","","","Health code enforcement","","Health Facilities  Our existing facility Elmhurst Hospital is operating at full capacity. While the doctors and nurses did a phenomenal ------ job during covid-19 , Elmhurst Hospital, in Queens, New York, is a 545-bed city hospital that serves as a safety-net institution for a largely working-class immigrant population. The novel coronavirus has quickly spread through this vulnerable community, and the hospital was operating at more than 100% capacity. In an effort to free up precious beds, dozens of non-Covid-related cases are being transferred to other facilities. Inpatient wards are overwhelmed with those who, under different circumstances, would belong in intensive care units. This was the “epicenter within the epicenter” of the Covid-19 crisis in New York City.  ","                                                      Health Care and Facilities  As per the Department of Health, community health profiles indicate that 38% of adults that reside in Community Board 3 do not have health insurance. We have the highest rate within the city. That is why the Corona Health Center's services must be enhanced. Upgrade and expand services at the Corona Health Center. The majority of the residents in the catchment area of the center are either under or uninsured and in dire need of medical assistance. Reinstate the dental clinic and expand services to include primary care, and free screenings for eye, ear, sickle cell anemia, asthma, diabetes, cholesterol, prostate, and breast cancer. Promote education and awareness on nutrition, smoking cessation, mental health, and treatment. A full-service clinic is urgently needed in North Corona. Constituents residing in this section of the district do not have the means to travel to the health center that is located in Brooklyn; it is the only city-operated facility that is offering these critical services. Increase Hospital Beds at Elmhurst Hospital and Borough-Wide Since 2008, five hospitals have closed in the Borough of Queens. Our area hospital is feeling the impact. Elmhurst Hospital is now accommodating many of the patients who used to go to the now-closed hospitals. Elmhurst Hospital reports that in the last 7 years the emergency department volumes have gone up 33% which is very significant. Patient wait time has considerably increased. Additional hospital beds and an expansion of the emergency room are sorely needed. Although Urgent Care facilities are opening around the board area and borough, it does not diminish the fact that more hospitals and the services they provide are still needed. ","Senior Services  The senior residents of our district make up nearly 10% of our population. In addition to home care, escort services, transportation and mental health services, seniors need assistance with legal and benefit services. Funding levels for DFTA and related agencies that provide these critical services must be increased. ","Services for the unhoused must be substantially improved. Essential services must be provided such as permanent housing, employment, training, and financial assistance to ensure success.  ","No comments","","","","","Youth workforce development and summer youth employment","","Youth Work Force Development  The summer youth program is essential for the development of our young people. These annual experiences help to develop character, expand the young person's horizons, and put them on their career track."," Community Board3's highest priority is to provide a first-class education for our children.  Before Covid-19 districts 24 and 30 had the highest incidence of overcrowding in our neighborhood schools. Both districts report that currently there has been less overcrowding since the pandemic . We expect that students will return to school. We hope to be ready to receive them by ensuring that every student will have a seat and the necessary tools for their success  Education remains our top priority. ","Affordable Child Care    Affordable child care services are vital to working families. Parents who have children under the age of four rely on these hard to find services. In order to support our moderate income families; fully fund and open up additional day care  facilities.","","","","","Crime prevention programs","","Explanation","Police Department  Community Board 3 continues to support the Roosevelt Avenue Task Force. Keep the Roosevelt Avenue Task Force and Impact Zone initiatives in place. Our local precinct is doing an outstanding job but could benefit from increased personnel and resources. Hire civilians to cover administrative duties so that police officers can l be freed up to address crime and quality of life complaints. School Crossing Guards. Hire additional school crossing guards to cover all of our area schools. The NCO program was recently implemented in Community Board 3. We see the program's value and its potential to significantly impact the quality of life of our residents. That is why we support the proposal to have additional NCO personnel so there will be coverage for 24 hours/seven days per week. We hope that serious consideration is given to our request. ","Fund FDNY's Smoke and Carbon Monoxide Detectors Distribution Program    Community Board 3 supports this life saving program.","","","","","Air quality and pollution","","Air Pollution Monitors CB3 is surrounded by LaGuardia Airport, BQE and Grand Central Parkway. Our residents are concerned about the impact of fumes emitting from motor vehicles and planes in the community. There is a high incidence of asthma & respiratory disease in our district. The need to install air monitors in our area is clear","Provide Funding for The Installation of a Dedicated Sewer System and Implement the Army Corp of Engineers  Recommendations  For decades residents have complained about the flooding that occurs whenever there is heavy rainfall. It was thought that these storms used to occur once in a hundred years. However, due to climate change, the incidence of flooding and sewer backups have become more frequent.  We call upon the City of New York to invest in upgrading our combined sewer to a dedicated system. In light of the devastation that the City of New York has experienced with Hurricane Ida,  it would be wise to provide funding to construct a dedicated sewer system, for doing so, will help to reduce the possibility of any further loss.  We ask DEP to give serious consideration to our request. ","Increase Litter Basket Collections Along Our Commercial Strips     In order to improve the level of cleanliness throughout the district, increase litter basket collection to three times per day. Urgent attention is needed  along 37th Ave.; Junction Blvd.; Roosevelt Ave.; Northern Blvd.; 103rd St. and 74th Streets; Astoria Blvd, 73rd Street and 72nd Street in Jackson Heights.    Providing these additional services will have a positive impact on the affected businesses and overall community.","","","","","Affordable housing creation","","Affordable Housing and Homelessness    Across the city, the incidence of homelessness has increased and is climbing because of the lack of affordable housing.  In our district, affordable housing is one of our top concerns because there are few affordable housing units.    According to the Furman report more than 53.3% of our population pay 35% or more of their income for rent. In addition, 25.5% of our residents live below the poverty level. For many of these families, it is a struggle each month. They have to make the difficult decision as to whether to pay the rent or forgo other essential needs.  They are always at risk for eviction and homelessness. Our housing courts tell the story; there is a disproportionate number of minority, low income and at risk individuals in housing court. Many cannot afford an attorney and end up losing their homes.    We are in a housing crisis, fewer affordable units are being developed and the focus now is to build luxury market rate apartments that cater to wealthier clientele.     While there is housing construction all over the district none of the developments are intended for low to middle income families.     To add to the mix, some unscrupulous landlords are forcing out families that are poor, have fixed incomes, those who cannot afford the higher rents, many seniors and disabled individuals have been impacted. Further, some of the participating property owners are opting out of the rent stabilization program.    Community Board 3 therefore calls upon the City of New York to put systems in place to encourage the development of affordable housing. More has to be done,  set a plan of action to encourage landlords to remain in the rent stabilization program. Develop incentives to attract new property owners to participate in rent stabilization.    We critically need more affordable housing and ask that urgent attention be given to this important issue.",": Increase staffing levels for Administrative & Community Outreach Units.      Additional administrative and community personnel is needed to improve the agency's ability to disseminate information and work with property owners.","Construct Affordable Housing for Middle, Low Income Families and Seniors    Around the district new buildings are going up, but nearly none of are affordable. A recent survey reported that “49 % of Queens residents shell out as much as 48% of their income on housing.""    In CB3, the average rental rate for apartments is approximately $1600 a month for one bedroom, which is far out of range for most working families. Young people who were born and raised in our community and seniors on fixed incomes cannot afford to live in the District. There is a urgent need for mid-low income housing facilities.    We have noted that in order to pay expensive rents families are doubling and tripling up in apartments and houses.    We need affordable housing that will fit in and support the needs of the existing community. Strategies and programs must be developed to stimulate the production of affordable housing facilities. Employ programs such as No property taxes for 5 years to encourage the development of affordable housing.","Conduct a Commercial District Needs Assessment-    Last winter Community Board 3 conducted a forum for  our area businesses. There was a good turnout, many of the operator’s questions centered around gaining access to capital, taxes, high rental rates, marketing, doing business with the City of New York and merchant organizing.    CB3 requests that funding be provided to conduct  a Commercial  District Needs Assessment to support our local businesses.","","","","","Parking operations","","Revisit, Review Recent Traffic Modifications.   DOT has implemented several initiatives within QCB3 that businesses have requested review. Modifications on Northern Boulevard, 34th Avenue, and Roosevelt Avenue has resulted in the loss of parking spaces.  Establishments complain that due to limited parking fewer customers are patronizing their businesses. Customers are opting to go to Long Island and locations where there is onsite parking. Some of these traffic changes have seriously impacted our small businesses' bottom line.  A few suggestions are to remove unused outdoor seating structures and install parking meters.   We call upon the agency to look into these concerns.  Speak with the area entrepreneurs to get a better outstanding of the impacts these changes have made on their businesses.         ","Upgrade street lights located along Roosevelt Avenue from 72nd to 114th Streets.     The recently installed streetlights are directed towards the street leaving the sidewalks very dark. Residents including NYPD are concerned about the unsafe conditions that could be caused due to poor or no lighting on the sidewalks. The illumination of the street lights are blocked by the elevated number 7 subway line.      Enhance street lighting by installing pedestrian lights on Roosevelt Avenue at the aforementioned locations as expeditiously as possible.","Community Board 3 was recently made aware of MTA’s plan to modify the route for the Q32 bus line. The route will be shorten, instead of terminating at 32 Street and 7th Avenue in Manhattan the last stop will be 52nd Street and Fifth Avenue. The change will pose a major hardship for the users of this bus route. The Q32 is the only bus in our district that goes to 34th Street in Manhattan. Our seniors and mobility challenged residents are the primary users of the service. Having to transfer twice to other buses, pay an additional fare or use the subway system to continue their trip to 34th Street is not feasible. If this one stop service to Macy's, Amtrak and the 7th Avenue shopping district is curtailed our vulnerable residents will have no other means to get to their destination short of paying for an expensive cab ride. We call upon the MTA to reevaluate their plan and come up with a workable solution that will serve all of its customers.","","","","","Quality of library programming","","Explanation","Open Space/Recreational Facilities and Programs    Our community needs and deserves more park space. It is well documented that CB3.Queens comes in second citywide as to having the least amount of park space. PlanNYC indicates that Community Board3’s open space is at .04 acres per 1000 residents, particularly in Jackson Heights. Combining the acreage of our athletic fields, courts, passive open spaces and community gardens totals .16 per 1000 resident. CB3 is woefully below the open space requirements set by NYC Neighborhood Standards.         We are committed to finding creative ways in which to increase public spaces and recreational programming within our district. We have supported expanding our public space by converting local streets into temporary playstreets/plazas and purchased private property to enlarge a local park, i.e. 78th Street Playstreet, Diversity Plaza and Rory Staunton Field.    While we are grateful for what has been accomplished thus far additional park space is sorely needed. We ask that funding be provided so that new sites can be identified and developed.","Louis Armstrong House Museum- Education Visitor Center The Louis Armstrong House Museum is a National Historic Landmark and a New York City landmark. It is the only landmark located within the confines of Community Board3 LAMH is located in the heart of North Corona. It is reported that the museum hosts over 12,500 visitors each year. The Visitor's Center is in its final stages of development. The new addition will allow the institution to accommodate more visitors; large groups, provide housing for the storage of the Louis Armstrong Archives, and expand programming to include concerts and forums. The current space is too small to conduct the aforementioned activities. Community Board 3 fully supports this project. We request that the construction of the n Visitor's Center be fully funded; that work commences expeditiously and opened before the close of 2023. ","Libraries Community Board 3 has four libraries and all are well utilized. The Center for Urban Future indicates that visitors to the Jackson Heights branch exceeded 445,970, North Corona 240,466., Langston Hughes 168,849, and East Elmhurst 66,595. Our residents both adults and children rely on our local libraries for employment information, cultural and educational programs, and general access to the internet. Libraries have always been one of our top priorities. We are pleased to see that our local facilities will be opened six days a week. We now look forward to the advancement of the following projects: The expansion of the Jackson Heights Library, the children's center is extremely overcrowded; consideration should be given to constructing an annex that will be located close to the existing facility. The Jackson Heights facility is the most heavily utilized branch in North West Queens. Residents who live north of Northern Boulevard must travel a distance.

Explanation:  Community Boards are understaffed, and underfunded and have always worked with less even during times of prosperity. An increase in funding levels for Community Boards would be in order. In addition, the advent of Hurricane Sandy and Irene underscored the need for improved communications with 311. We need the ability to retrieve information from the 311 databases in order to analyze conditions that impact our community.   Community Boards are now required to Live Stream meetings as per the Comptroller's Office. We do not have the financial wherewithal to pay for consultant fees or equipment.

The total land area of Community Board 4Q is 2.4 square miles, bounded by Roosevelt Avenue to the North, Flushing Meadow Corona Park (FMCP) to the east, the Horace Harding Expressway to the south, and the New York Connecting Railroad (CSX) to the West. Community Wellness and Health Facilities  For several years now, CB4Q has proudly been home to two farmers markets, (Corona Plaza, and Elmhurst Hospital) The possibility of a 3rd to cover the South Elmhurst area is a request that our community has been actively seeking for some time. We encourage ""GrowNYC"" to increase its footprint, and work with the community in identifying a space with the intent of bringing more markets. Specifically, in the wake of the current pandemic, fitness classes, and other health-related initiatives geared towards providing our community with the knowledge and resources they need to stay fit are happily supported throughout our constituency.  Public Health Urgent care facilities throughout the district are indeed a welcome addition as many constituents see these facilities as a cheaper, quicker alternative to the negative stigmas associated with an actual hospital. Although these facilities have gained popularity, the fact remains that the residents of the surrounding neighborhoods of Elmhurst, Corona, Maspeth, and Glendale are still in need of an actual hospital. Urgent care facilities are not made to replace hospitals, but to work in conjunction with them.  Exorbitant rent and overdevelopment throughout our community are leaving many seniors displaced with no place to turn. Waiting lists on housing take years to move, and seniors are left with little to no choice as they wait for a spot to be available. Funding is sorely needed to identify and obtain property to construct such a facility.  Public Safety and the 110th Precinct Facilities Until recently, since 1988, the Community Board has put the renovation of the 110th Precinct at the very top of its yearly capital requests. For approximately 7 decades, this facility has seen little to no improvements to its overall infrastructure. Both within and outside the facility, structural crumbling, loose bricks, and flooding are common. As one of the busiest precincts in Queens North, and with now over 250 uniformed and civilian personnel this structure is in need of necessary repairs.  Additionally, the community has been requesting a proper parking facility for the 20 or so vehicles being stored along the residential block surrounding the precinct. In a district where parking is at a premium, we should be looking to provide parking for our officers all the while returning parking spaces to the residents of the surrounding community.  Historical Significance, Signage and Preservation The community of CB4 Queens, is rich in cultural history with many buildings dating back to the 1700s. Newtown (now Elmhurst) settled in 1652 and is the second oldest settlement in Queens. One of the first religious buildings in Newtown was the old St. James Episcopal Church which is now Elmhurst's oldest remaining building and a New York City landmark. Other NYC Landmark buildings in the community include Newtown High School, the Elks Lodge, Fire Engine 289, and the Dutch Reformed Church of Newtown in Elmhurst, and Congregation Tifereth Israel, the Unisphere, and the Edward E. Sanford House in Corona which established itself in the late 19th century as a residential development. Elmhurst also benefits from the dedication of the Elmhurst History and Cemeteries & Preservation Society (EHCPS) which is a group founded by Newtown Civic members working toward landmarking, researching, documenting, and preserving the history of a community which dates back to 1652 and is the second oldest community in Queens, behind Flushing.  The rich history surrounding CB4 is fascinating and should be recognized as such. Several parks with significant historical meaning often have their history forgotten due to a lack of properly displayed information. With the increase in development geared towards promoting tourism specifically around Elmhurst, historical facts can easily be forgotten. At the very least, proper signage should be implemented at key locations (parks, cemeteries) throughout the district as is done in rural Pennsylvania towns.  Emphasis should be put on the multitude of parks scattered throughout our Board as a starting point as these parks are often historical pillars that tell stories of Elmhurst, Newtown, and Corona. Furthermore, applications for landmarks are often overlooked, and denied, a practice that will only serve to further hide the rich past that makes up CB4. Our parks are also cultural spaces, a fact that is often forgotten.  Parks and Wellness With Queens Parks ratings as high as they are, we should be looking to encourage visitors and tourists to enjoy our public spaces to their full capacity. Future park schematics/ designs should all a performance space baselined into their designs since their inception. Such spaces would help to tackle health issues and promote wellness via programs such as ""ShapeUpNYC."" Public performances would also increase, as such spaces would better accommodate and essentially promote more holiday ceremonies throughout the district celebrating the multitudes of ethnic groups that make up our district.    Corona & Elmhurst are heavily immigrant, densely populated, working-class neighborhoods, with all the street life, bustling small-business entrepreneurialism, and social life that implies. We rely upon and--in normal times--crowd & stress our mass transit and roadway infrastructure. Over the past decade or so, we have also seen a marked increase in visitors, both New Yorkers & tourists.  Longstanding attractions in and around Flushing Meadows Corona Park (Citi Field, Arthur Ashe Stadium, The Queens Zoo, The Queens Museum of Art, Queens Theatre in the Park, NY Hall of Science) have been joined by new draws including the Aquatic Center and Rink, and the Queens Night Market now entering its 8th consecutive year. There has also been a surge in culinary tourism throughout CB4, and two of the city's largest malls are here, on Queens Blvd.  In fact, in 2015, Time Magazine's Lonely Planet issue named Queens the Number 1 tourist destination in the country.  Transportation and Mobility Our subway and roadway infrastructure must be maintained for our residents and businesses to thrive. Our streets are crowded with pedestrians, drivers, and cyclists, as well as users of new modes of micro-mobility, such as e-bikes and electric and foot-powered scooters. All these people must be kept safe as they interact. Most of CB4Q is within walking distance of our subway lines, but a large piece of South Corona is solely reliant on bus service as there are only two bus nodes within the confines of CB4Q (74th St and Roosevelt Ave, and Hoffman Drive in Elmhurst) However, while there is a general push to remove carbon emitting vehicles from the streets, the dangers of using lithium ion batteries is very much a cause for concerns, and has already been responsible for several major fires in the district.  Restorative Justice Within the U.S. the rate of mass incarceration has increased tremendously over the past years. Black and brown people make up the vast majority of those incarcerated. For this reason, it is important to lean towards ending mass incarceration and finding other methods to help people in forms of prevention. In addition, it is important to fund restorative justice programs while also creating more awareness about such programs. Going into classrooms and teaching students about the importance of restorative justice and the impacts it can have on the lives of many. Furthermore, it is good to empower individuals that have been through the justice system in order for them to be able to fight the bias that comes with being incarcerated. ","","","","","Land use trends","","The ongoing problem of overdevelopment continues within CB4Q. It is not uncommon that older housing stock, (one and two-family homes) are demolished and replaced with new buildings that house three, four, and more family homes. This leads to loss of neighborhood character and cultural and historic landmarks.  This overdevelopment is also responsible for raising housing prices, and contributing to the lack of affordabilitiy in housing.  The current levels of City service and infrastructure can no longer absorb the additional housing units. To secure the future stability and quality of life of CB4Q, careful consideration must be given to district wide contextual rezoning.","Police-community relations","","Over the past couple years the relationship between police officers and members of the community has changed. This has been widely seen in NYC overall causing the increased distrust from constituents towards officers. This causes far more arrests to be made in the low income areas, which leads to many people of these communities to not want to interact with the police. In addition, there have been many instances of regular traffic stops turning lethal as well as illegal stop, question, and frisk moments which in turn led to an increase in incarceration. Interactions like these have instilled fear in the minds of people causing them to not want to have contact with law enforcement.  In multicultural communities such as Corona, people of different immigration statuses are often scared to report things to their local precinct with the fear of potentially being deported or separated from their family. A lot of this is because of the lack of information folks have in regards to law enforcement and the different departments within the system.    Furthermore, we are seeing an uptick in violence within the subways. Although there are more officers monitoring the subways, people are still seeking reassurance. In order for the relationship between law enforcement and constituents to improve, local precincts should more strongly emphasize programs revolving around community affairs. (Attending community fairs, going into schools and talking to students about the ins and outs of their jobs. In addition, local precincts should continue working with local precinct councils on info sessions where people have the opportunity to ask officers questions about certain laws and about rights that they have. It's important for officers to get to know the people who live in the communities that they are patrolling. ","Social services","","The City's overall stance on Community Board processes is normally viewed as ""let's focus on the end result, and not question how their processes work"" without realizing just how much work goes into Boards' daily functions.  This is no longer acceptable. Boards rely heavily on City Council and Borough President appointed volunteers, but are often understaffed.  Items including, but certainly not limited to: yearly Needs statements, Public Hearings, and committee meetings, are just a portion of the City Charter requirements for board volunteers to review, generate, and manage.  The constituents of CB4 require multiple needs and services, yet one of the most pressing issues that our district is confronted with is an information gap that exists between constituents and the services meant to benefit them. Boards' 2-3 staff members are simply not enough to organize events and address constituent needs. As one of the most densely populated districts in the city, our board requires additional funding to expand our organizing capacity by hiring additional staff. An overall increase to our Operating Budget should be considered. By growing Community Board staff, we can work to close this information gap and positively impact our community by informing them of issues, resources, and opportunities for development.  Boards are considered to be the City's front line of defense managing countless constituent issues, zoning variances, public meetings, and generation of yearly Needs Statements.  With such important items on the backs of Boards, fully funded public workshops/presentations on what exactly Community Boards do should be mandatory, and not just left to each CB to handle at their own accord.    Despite this heavy responsibility, staffing for many CB's is grossly inadequate for the amount of work output, causing many of them to resort to interns and volunteers as a primary source of help. ","","","","","Services to reduce or prevent homelessness","","This has become a crisis in our area and is now a leading concern for the health, well-being, and public safety of the members of our community. If one does not have shelter, you cannot provide adequately for one's family through income, which leads to continued disregard for your health. The logical analysis is that the person suffers holistically. The hotels that served as shelters in our community are no longer a solution. While we fully understand that nobody should be homeless and that it can happen to anyone, this initiative was not well thought out as several shelters have multigenerational families in them. Communities are often sneakily informed at the last minute about new hotels that have already been ﬁlled to capacity with homeless individuals. These hotel’s 100% capacity of homeless individuals has driven the newly homeless to our street corners. The time for discussions for solutions has arrived. This crisis creeps daily into the blurred lines of health and public safety. It drives our citizens into positions of dangerous jobs to secure income to obtain housing and means to procure insurance for healthcare.","Community Board 4Q (CB4Q) is home to NYC Health + Hospitals/ Elmhurst (H+H/Elmhurst), a city-funded level 1 trauma center within the heart of Queens. This hospital sees a tremendous number of patients spanning the entire borough. While the hospital received several upgrades and expansions over the last few years, with more to come, it remains the only city-funded level 1 trauma center within the immediate reach of our communities. The neighbouring hospitals are community-level, private or level 2 trauma centers. This leaves H+H/Elmhurst to carry the heavy trauma burden for a large portion of Queens. The recurrent issue resides with supporting H+H/Elmhurst, which takes funding and staff. If this hospital remains underfunded, it will continue to hemorrhage staff. This chain reaction of unfilled positions creates more budget cuts for the hospital and increases healthcare professionals with burnout. Eventually, departments will reduce operations or close as they struggle to meet operational demands. The surrounding neighbourhoods of Woodside, Maspeth, and Glendale are all served by H+H/Elmhurst and already suffer from current suboptimal operations. The pandemic emphasised the extent that the hospital was overwhelmed and was prepared to handle the sudden influx of the largely undercounted population. Funding for this facility is as we cannot sustain another emergency public health crisis. We hope to rectify this underfunding to prevent a scenario where daily trauma operations are in jeopardy.  Urgent care facilities are a welcome addition to reduce and support emergency departments. They help relieve some of the burdens of the emergency room for non-urgent trauma, yet they are not made to see trauma cases or replace hospitals. In addition to advocating for the hospital's needs, we will continue to support public campaigns emphasizing the importance and the need for quality health insurance and preventive measures such as having a primary care provider. We must increase health literacy and support this endeavour by providing this information in the multiple languages spoken within this diverse community. ","While Corona has seen new senior living facilities (HANAC) as of late, sections of the district specifically in Elmhurst are in need of affordable senior housing. Exorbitant rent and overdevelopment throughout our community are leaving many seniors displaced with no place to turn. Waiting lists on housing take years to move, and seniors are left with little to no choice as they wait for a spot to be available. Funding is sorely needed to identify and obtain property to construct such a facility. ","With the change in federal administration, we've also seen change in legislation. One of the biggest changes applies to the asylum seeking process. Although there has been a lot of debate over the Migrant Protection Protocols, we are now seeing an influx of asylum seekers coming into major cities like our very own. As NYC welcomes these people with open arms, it is very important that these folks have access to necessary resources. Some resources include providing access to adequate schools, and after school programs. In addition, providing access to resources for children with special needs. Making sure that schools have staff members who are fluent in other languages, to ensure that these children are able to communicate in schools. In addition, creating programs specifically for asylum seeking parents/guardians in order to help them get back on their feet and help set them up to have the best opportunities. In addition, it is important that these folks are able to get adequate and affordable housing. Whether it be by creating more supportive housing options, or providing easier access to affordable housing units. ","As New York City continues to experience the current pandemic, the needs of our low income residents are more evident than they ever have. Lack of proper medical insurance, proper housing, and lack of unemplyoment benefits or stimulus packages to our undercounted residents led Elmhurst and Corona to be epicenters within an epicenter.  The high death toll and understaffing of our hospitals coupled with evictions due to lack of income were at an all time high in NYC, with an emphasis on the already underserved, and undercounted population of CB4Q.  Initiatives to create a balance of benefits for all residents, officially counted or not, should be heavily scrutinized as no viable solution exists.  We  will continue to be at the forefront of bridging the gap between the undocumented population of our communities, and those who receive full benefits and income. ","","","","","After school programs","","Within our community there is a lack of programs for the advancement of our youth. Kids in middle and high school are in class for 8 hours a day, and after those 8 hours are done, they may not have much to do. Oftentimes, not having direct supervision combined with boredom can idle time, especially once class is done for the day. For this reason, there is a need to create incentives for the youth to look forward to after school. One way of doing this is by increasing the access to part time after school jobs in order to give kids the opportunity to make some extra income in a healthy and safe environment. By partnering with local mom and pop shops and local franchises, programs could be created to allocate a percentage of hires to be kids from the local middle and high schools. Also, providing paid after school tutoring and mentorship programs will give students the opportunities to further their leadership, communication, time management and problem solving skills. These skills are very important, as they can be used in and outside of the classroom. In addition, these skills are useful for any future endeavors.   In addition, to paid after school jobs, another program that is needed and would be in our youths best interest is that of college readiness programs. These programs would be aimed more towards high school students thinking about continuing their education with emphasis on students that come from low income backgrounds and who go to school that may not have many resources. By partnering with local colleges, whether they are a part of the public sector (CUNY) or the private sector, the creation of such programs would allow high school students to receive college credit in return for taking after school courses. In addition, taking kids to visit local colleges/ universities and speak with college representatives would give them insight on what college life is like and things they would likely have to be prepared for. This is another incentive that would allow for kids to be able to do something productive while improving their critical thinking and collaboration skills. Programs like this would allow for kids to have a sense of fulfillment and get excited about their education and their future. Furthermore, another type of program that is needed within the community is that of career readiness. This is something that can be aimed at youth that may be indecisive as to whether they want to continue their education or not. This type of program can also be aimed at youth who are completely sure they don’t want to go to college and are looking to go straight into the workforce. Programs like this would review topics such as resume building, how to attract employers, interviews, and partnering with experts of different fields to spread knowledge their expertise, and what a typical day would entail.","The lack of early childhood services and parent services in our district continues to be a cause for concern.  In the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, more than ever, the need for mentoring, homework help, counseling, and overall social networking is evident. In addition to the allocation of funds for after school programming, the need for a multi-purpose community/recreational center is a request that our board has held onto for some time. Such a center would provide the youth of CB4Q with the social skills required for their growth. Communal activities such as sports, arts and crafts, and after school workshops are just a few of the different programs that could be offered at such a facility, especially in a day where social media, smartphones, and video games reign above all else. Our youth lacks basic social skills that can only be obtained through communal activities and physical, social contact with each other. For this reason, our constituency is asking that acquisition of land, and furthermore, the construction of an intergenerational (seniors and youth under one roof) and/or after school center within our district be looked into. ","With the expansive growth of immigrant families with young children in our district, there is a great need for Early Childhood Services for children Birth to Three. The services that we are in need of are quality infant-toddler care and early childhood education provided by trained professionals with a culturally sensitive and linguistically sensitive focus. Currently, there is an insufficient number of Early Childhood centers in our district that service Infants and Toddlers and their parents and we are in desperate need of facilities to provide the space to render such services. According to a recent Unicef report on early childhood development, an economically disadvantaged child has the opportunity to thrive socially and academically when provided with early intervention and early childhood services. In addition, the report states the following: • Brain development is most rapid in the early years of life. When the quality of stimulation, support, and nurturance is deficient, child development is seriously affected. • The effects of early disadvantage on children can be reduced. Early interventions for disadvantaged children lead to improvements in children's survival, health, growth, and cognitive and social development. • Children who receive assistance in their early years achieve more success at school. As adults, they have higher employment and earnings, better health, and lower levels of welfare dependence and crime rates than those who don't have these early opportunities. • Efforts to improve early child development are an investment, not a cost. Available cost-benefit ratios of early intervention indicate that for every dollar spent on improving early child development, returns can be on average 4 to 5 times the amount invested, and in some cases, much higher. ","","","","","Other - Write In (Required)","","The most important issue facing Elmhurst & Corona's public safety & Emergency Services is the rise in general crime in our communities. Specifically in the wake of the pandemic, our district has seen an overall rise in theft, sex crimes, and violent crimes, including assault, domestic violence, & hate crimes. These do not include the countless crimes that are unreported. The community would benefit from an overall improvement to our precinct's facilities and increasing the size of its staff to adequately protect the growing population which includes a sizeable amount that are unaccounted for. The most recent Census resulted in a drastic undercount of residents in our communities in turn adversely affecting disbursement and allocation of personnel.  Despite campaigns encouraging census participation, less affluent communities with a large undocumented population were grossly affected as many agencies including NYPD depend heavily on accurate numbers to operate.  The 110 Precinct houses approx. 250 personnel including civilians which not only have oversight and responsibility for the Community Board's footprint, but also includes Roosevelt Avenue and portions of Flushing Meadows Corona Park. (FMCP) An improved facility to house officers, store impounded vehicles, and a parking facility for agency vehicles have been requested by the Board and surrounding community since the late 1980's.  Additionally, satellite offices in high crime areas like FMCP, our local malls, and our commercial corridors (Junction Blvd., Roosevelt Avenue, 57th Avenue) would be a welcome addition to address homelessness, unlicensed businesses and street vendors, and new issues with  illegal sex work and human trafficking.  A precinct operating with resources and personnel made to oversee a community with grossly inaccurate numbers is cause for concern.","There is a dire need for support in addressing our biggest public safety issues. Unlicensed street vendors have massively increased in many of our commercial corridors affecting the quality of life of both residents and local businesses.  Scattered reports of gang extortion, violence, and harassment on these vendors and workers have been brought to the attention of community leaders, and concerns over the wellbeing of these vendors' livelihood is a cause for concern. The resulting solution to regulate these vendors with more oversight from City agencies and community partners is certainly a welcome step in the right direction, and will provide the necessary resources for our thriving vendor population to sell its wares. Another issue that has been brought to our attention is the noted increase in sex crimes specifically towards the transgender community.  We have heard from multiple constituents that this has gravely affected their quality of life, and reports of parents who fear walking with their children are higher than ever.  Lastly, creating extensive programs to assist our homeless population to find housing, programs geared around restorative justice, and community integrative programs would all be welcome.  ","For the safety and health of our community, we request improvement in our emergency services. Due to the uptick in intense climate changes, fires could increase throughout NYC.  However, our community is at a disadvantage to address these problems. With a crumbling fire house and an insufficient number of FDNY staff for the unaccounted balloon in population, despite their best effort, our emergency service personnel may benefit from investment on a governmental level. Additional funding would provide increases to staffing, extra maintenance for emergency infrastructure (i.e.: ERS boxes), and expand on safety and prevention programs such as the FDNY's  the Fire Safety Education Unit.   Lastly, is the lack of a means of egress for emergency vehicles during emergencies. Narrow streets formerly designed for chariots and low population housing  make it difficult to deliver emergency services when they're needed most.  Past hurricanes and intense rain falls have shown that many dwellings in our communities are susceptible to flooding as unlicensed, below street level apartments flood during extreme weather conditions. ","","","","","Preparedness for extreme weather events (incl. coastal flooding, heat waves, cold snaps, heavy wind and rain)","","NYC weather patterns have shifted and now where we once had moderate rainfall, we frequently see abrupt heavy downpours, and extended periods of consistent rain. The existing storm system designed for older patterns is inadequate for surges of water. The conditions are exacerbated by lack of maintenance of the rain garden infrastructure and the accumulation of waste and litter in our catch basins. Where many areas of the district were formerly detached houses, these have been replaced by larger buildings with an increased impermeable surface, leaving water with no place to go but into basements and low points in the roadway. Flood mitigation requires two factors: both an appropriate drain for the surge, and retention for the duration of the rainfall. ","Several corridors along CB4Q are in need of upgrades to their sewers. Basements along the commercial district of 82nd Street between Roosevelt Avenue and Baxter Avenue, as well as homes along the south side of 111th Street as referenced in our priorities, suffer from sewer backups, and ponding issues along their streets. A general upgrade of our infrastructure should take precedence to meet current and future demand. We continue to undergo the issue with the rain garden initiative (formerly referred to as bioswales) brought forth by the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP). When the rain garden program was unveiled in the district, it was received with trepidation as concerns were immediately brought up with regards to the accountability of rain garden maintenance. While the Community Board was in favor of the overall concept behind them, the fear was that these rain gardens would quickly become garbage pits. DEP does its best to rectify the issue, but rain gardens throughout the district can go months with no cleanup on behalf of the agency. Staffing is simply not enough. A general increase to staffing specifically towards the maintenance of the gardens would be of huge benefit to our community. A summons structure should also be more firmly set in place as rules behind rain gardens are clearer now, yet many of our constituents and street vendors show little regard to the importance of the gardens often sabotaging them, and selling their wares in the existing tree beds.  ","Throughout the district, our constituency has seen an increase in the amount of garbage being strewn throughout our streets. Abandoned lots covered in garbage are common ground, and home owners and businesses alike tend to overlook laws regarding the cleanliness of their sidewalks. Changes to recycling laws are constant, and new programs such as electronic/textile/compost are confusing and present a change that many of our constituents have not yet grasped. Informational campaigns in multiple languages for public education on recycling, and responsibilities of property owners are a constant request heard throughout our constituency.  It has also been noted that DSNY enforcement tends to be lax in some cases, and overly aggressive in others due mostly to the fact that several agents have openly stated that they themselves do not know the actual laws. Dialogue between DEP, and DSNY Enforcement must be made crystal clear to form a more cohesive plan to keep our streets clean.  Funding and emphasis should be put into public informational campaigns designed to educate our constituents. These campaigns should be in multiple languages, and be a year round effort to be most effective, and not only at the inception of these programs. ","","","","","Affordable housing creation","","Like clockwork, the rent bill arrives at the first of every month. In New York City, real estate comes at a premium. Owners (landlords) rightfully collect rent to provide shelter to families. It is not in dispute. How much of the hard-working family’s wages are devoted to covering the rent? Is a hard-working family working to pay rent because of a shortage of affordable housing? In District 4, one family wakes in a cramped dwelling unit, taking turns using the limited space before heading out for the day. With gross wages of $3,330, the family’s net income after deductions is $2,664, and the rent is $1,700. Another family in District 4 with a higher income of $100,000 rents a larger apartment for $2,900, keeping $5,990 of their monthly gross income of $8,333. To put this into perspective for District 4, statistical charts show that 40% of the District’s residents from the first family pay 51% of their gross income and 63% of their net income towards rent. Meanwhile, 24% of the District’s residents from the second family allocate 35% of their gross income and 50% of their net income to rent. Calculating the percentage of income allocated for rent (excluding utilities) is pivotal for financial stability and ensuring resources for essential needs. According to the HUD guidelines, rents exceeding 30% of a month’s income represent a rent burden, while rents above 50% are deemed severe (1)(2)(3). The prevalent issue of overcrowding (4) results from the exorbitant rent costs. Families struggle to make ends meet, compromising on the space to live. Even those with higher incomes cannot progress because of the rent burdens.","Existing one-story buildings are being replaced with high-density buildings at a rate too fast to be kept up with. A planned balance between residential and commercial buildings is sorely needed. For far too long, we have operated under the careless mentality of ""when it is needed, we'll deal with it."" The intricacies behind infrastructural projects combined with a lack of funding and staffing have led our agencies to operate with little to no time to actually handle issues on a proactive basis. Community services and utility companies are increasing their services as the need arises, and not before. The fact is that large sections of Elmhurst and Corona were designed as a tightly woven network of 1-2 family houses whose streets are far too narrow, and simply not prepared to handle such an influx of tourism in such a short amount of time. With close to 75% of the district's makeup being residential, it is evident that people want to live here. What is a constant problem for us, however, is the misconception that in order to solve the problem, more housing should be created. Throughout the year, variances are constantly being brought to Community Boards for review thus converting 2 and 3 family homes into multi dwellings of 15 or more families. The growth is blatantly evident, yet very little emphasis is being put into actual upgrades to our streets or sewer systems. There should be more conversation and initiatives geared towards not only providing affordable housing but also taking into consideration that housing initiatives require substantial infrastructural changes especially in neighborhoods such as Corona and Elmhurst that have seen a tremendous surge in population within the last 5-10 years. ","The lack of NYCHA housing within our district is a cause for concern with many households living below the poverty line. There should be more conversation and initiatives geared towards providing affordable housing. Careful consideration must be made into the locations of such developments as substantial infrastructural upgrades are often needed. The neighborhoods of Corona and Elmhurst already suffer from a lack of parking and have seen substantial increases in traffic. While we have a tremendous need for such facilities, the inherent inconvenience of putting them wherever possible can be more detrimental than helpful. We support open dialogue in the obtaining of land and eventual construction of such a facility within our district. ","A). CDD BANK AND COMMUNITY ECONOMIC INSTITUTIONS The government cannot address all of CB4Q's district needs. Private capital and or government partnership may work together to revitalize our communities. This district needs additional Community Development Districts (CDD) banks and Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) to build affordable housing, grow businesses, produce jobs, and create investments and opportunities to save and grow towards wealth. The unbanked and underbanked communities need customized products to grow money rather than waste it on check cashing fees, etc. Citizens Committee for Children of New York's (CCCNY) research study revealed that the district is still severely underserved.  Moreover, New York City Banking Commission and New York State Finance designated Corona a Community Development District underserved area on March 1, 2005, fifteen years ago.   Therefore, we request New York City EDC and New York City Banking Commission study and develop additional BDD (Banking Development District) for the CB4Q area to encourage and assist banks in opening branches in this traditionally underserved area. It will promote long-term economic development, business and job growth, community revitalization, and provide savings accumulation.     B) COMMUNITY LAND BANKS AND COMMUNITY LAND BANK We recommend the following actions are taken to support the exploration, creation, and development of land banks in our neighborhoods in an effort to assist with the affordable housing and small business crises that have long faced our community:   	Pass legislation in the City Council to authorize a New York City Land Bank. Last year, New York City Councilmember Brad Lander filed legislation to create a land bank, which has since garnered nine additional sponsors;[iv] 	Draft by-laws that allow the land bank to manage properties under a community land trust model in order to ensure permanent affordability on properties acquired by maintaining long-term control of the properties. 	Begin working with Empire State Development Corporation to prepare a land bank application; 	Seed the land bank by transferring vacant, city-owned properties and/or redirecting a portion of outstanding tax liens to the land bank, rather than to the existing trust; and 	Allow the new land bank to manage the foreclosure of tax-delinquent properties that are either vacant or underutilized to create a pipeline for affordable housing.   References:   https://comptroller.nyc.gov/reports/building-an-affordable-future-the-promise-of-a-new-york-city-land-bank/ https://ag.ny.gov/feature/land-bank-community-revitalization-initiative-land-bank-cri     C) STREET VENDORS: The eclectic nature of Elmhurst and Corona, combined with the astronomical prices on rent for 'brick and mortar' establishments, has led Community Board 4 to be a mecca for street vendors. The sheer amount of nationalities, cultures, and craftsmen within the district has encouraged those seeking employment to establish themselves as successful street vendors. The concern, however, is over the high amount of vendors that flood areas where commercial traffic is extremely high, and the negative impact this can have on brick-and-mortar businesses. Laws are in effect that help to govern the distance between street vendors and physical establishments selling similar wares, but complaints to agencies and fights between vendors are far too numerous to log. While it is universally understood that many street vendors are, in fact, tax-paying businesses, there should be an understanding that inspections of vendors (food or otherwise) be far more consistent. Furthermore, compliance and safety education should be implemented before enforcement, specifically in heavily utilized commercial corridors such as Corona Plaza, Roosevelt Avenue, Junction Boulevard, the Queens Center Mall, and the area within the purview of the 82nd Street Business Improvement District (82nd Street Partnership). ","","","","","Pedestrian safety (safer crossings, sidewalk management, etc.)","","Pedestrian safety in Community Board 4 is a major concern.  Traffic signs are outdated and should be replaced with reflective signage, which would increase the rate at which motorists look out for and yield to pedestrians in crosswalks and schools. Awareness plays a major role in preventing injury or death.  Area schools would benefit from additional crossing guards to help children cross the street and remind drivers of the importance of respecting pedestrian crosswalks, thereby eliminating fatalities.  Crossing guards will also serve to point out potential safety hazards and prevent unlawful parking when parents are dropping off children at school, causing traffic backups. Several new schools have been constructed in CB4 in recent years; the number of crossing guards must be increased to allow the assignment of crossing guards to dangerous intersections near ALL our schools; children attending newly established schools cannot be left in peril because of arbitrary caps on the number of school crossing guards assigned to Board 4.  We suggest working with the NYC Dept. of Consumer and Worker Protection (DCWP) on literature and training for independent contractors and businesses using delivery services, to inform their employees to follow traffic rules, point out dangers, etc.  More accountability, processes and licensing for delivery drivers to inform workers about pedestrian safety must be mandated.  With the increased use of e-bikes, scooters, and bicycles as an economical mode of transportation, and with the popularity and growth of bicycle lanes, pedestrian, rider, and driver education and enforcement are vital.  More must be done to impose guidelines on those vehicle operators while taking into consideration fines for the offending operator.  Within its parameters, Community Board 4 claims Queens Blvd. which was once known as the “Boulevard of Death” due to the high number of vehicle related deaths.  Many persons have died on this stretch of roadway which may be caused by not having enough time to cross before the traffic light changes. We ask that DOT review pedestrian crossing times along Queens Blvd, especially at 51st Ave, 57th Ave, Woodhaven Blvd, and Broadway/Grand Ave.  A safety plan is urgently needed for the protection of pedestrians and to save lives.","Over the past few years, Broadway from Jackson Heights to Queens Blvd has undergone traffic flow and safety improvements. These improvements do seem to have had some positive effects on Broadway's traffic congestion. We have been impressed by the use of a bus-only traffic signal at Whitney Ave that gives buses a head-start on other vehicles when the light changes.   We suggest that DOT take a look at Roosevelt Ave between 71st St and 83 St, and at all of Corona Ave and Junction Blvd. Despite recent proposed changes, we note that there do continue to be problems with the traffic congestion on Broadway at 45th & Whitney Aves and at Woodside/Baxter Aves. We are informed that the implementation of the Queens Blvd capital reconstruction and landscaping project is expected to begin soon. We hope that the City's current financial challenges will not delay this project.   There is a speeding problem at various locations throughout Board 4. We are requesting this year that DOT look specifically at National St and 102nd St between 43rd & Corona Aves and devise steps that can be taken to end the speeding problem in this neighborhood.  ","The residents of Board 4 are heavily dependent on our mass-transit system. Our first priority for NYCT is our continuing support for their announced plan to rehab the 7 train subway stations along Roosevelt Ave, serving Corona, Elmhurst, and Jackson Heights. We have seen the magnificent job the MTA did on the N-line stations along 31st St in Astoria. We would be extremely happy to see something like that done along Roosevelt Ave. It is our hope that all the stations on this segment of the line that have not been recently rebuilt will be included in this multi-station project. If the MTA is going to be undertaking rehabs of the Roosevelt Ave stations, we strongly urge the inclusion of an additional means of egress from the Flushing-bound platforms at the 82nd, 90th, and 103rd St/Corona Plaza stations. Prior to the pandemic, we saw very serious platform crowding at these stations during the evening rush hours. Since there will be construction projects at these stations, we urge design and construction of an additional platform-to-street exit stair at each. CB4 would also encourage the MTA to undertake ADA access projects for as many of these stations as possible at the same time as the station rehabs, coordinating the construction and service disruptions so as to minimize inconvenience to the riding public.  We further call on the MTA to undertake as soon as possible an ADA access project at the Woodhaven Blvd station on the M & R lines. This station serves two major shopping malls and is at the nexus of a large number of bus lines serving many neighborhoods in central and western Queens. Disabled riders getting off buses here find themselves simply out of luck in any effort to get onto the subway. ","","","","","Quality of parks and park facilities","","The parks in our area serve as the crown jewels for residents and families.  Our parks not only provide healthy green space but also offer our residents free or low cost places to go and enjoy nature.  Not only do Parks provide quality areas for families, youth, and seniors regardless of their ability to pay, parks give the community a sense of diverse activity improving the quality of life for all our residents to secure fresh air, stay active, and unite with members of the family.  It is vital our parks are well maintained and accessible to all especially those with disabilities.  Our playgrounds and siting areas are highly used to the fullest extent and the need for additional maintenance workers and recreational aides is essential.  COVID-19 has severely affected the use and maintenance of our parks.  Full staffing must be returned. Our parks host many community events and sponsor programs which bring enjoyment to our residents and families.  As a result of the pandemic, there are fewer park programs and lost park related employment.  More is needed to bring back our parks to its full potential. In an area with an overabundance of residents, every inch of space is needed to accommodate people. Clean and well maintained parks provide a sense of pride to our communities. Over the years, our parks have seen some improvements, but more is needed: Parks such as Newtown Playground and Hoffman Park in Elmhurst sustained heavy damage during the last 2 hurricane seasons, and should be retrofitted with flood mitigation measures, now, and in advance offor future use.  Additionally, many of our playgrounds still operate on outdated Multi Purpose Play Areas (MPPA's) . Future park redesign should make the a priority given the lack of schoolyards within SD24.","Community Board 4's area parks provide a quiet place to relax while providing fresh air and green space to our residents. Parks must be maintained to preserve the quality and excellence of a valuable community resource. Continuous maintenance and staffing should be a long term goal to maintain excellence in our parks. More programs for children should be implemented as an integral part of a parks curriculum as this would foster children in making new friends and interacting with other children which in turn leads to positive development. Children are the future of our community and a sense of well-being and social improvement is key.  To note, visitors of all ages are engaged for an entire day.In order to ensure continuity, staffing must be provided not only for maintenance but also for community wellness. In these times of economic hardship, parks provide free activity for our families. But they must be kept clean and without any threat of danger to those utilizing the parks. Funding for Parks Enforcement is sorely needed to safeguard the well-being of all.  It is essential that playground equipment such as basketball courts, volleyball courts and other children's amenities in parks do not fall into disrepair and become unusable for youth.The aftermath of the Pandemic created a huge mental health crises and a reduction in physical activity. Parks play a major role in reducing anxiety and stress by giving an outlet to exercise and as an added benefit reducing obesity by utilizing a more active lifestyle.Moreover, to preserve the ever-lasting beauty of the parks, the trees and flora must remain alive and flowering. Planting and pruning must be included in funding for parks so that their beauty is everlasting.  The importance of parks beautifying a community is priceless and should continue as a funding priority. ","We need to educate more people about the significant history that Elmhurst and Corona contain. Several parks with significant historical meaning often have their history forgotten due to a lack of properly displayed information. With the increase in development geared towards promoting tourism specifically around Elmhurst, historical facts can easily be forgotten. At the very least, proper signage should be implemented at key locations (parks and cemeteries) throughout the district (I.e.: Josephine Caminiti, Louis Simeone, Manuel De Dios), as is done in Manhattan. Emphasis should be put on the multitude of parks scattered throughout our Board as a starting point as these parks are often historical pillars that tell stories of Elmhurst, Newtown, and Corona. Furthermore, applications for landmarks, such as historic Judge Street are often overlooked and denied; a practice that will only serve to further hide the rich past that makes up CB4. ","With the number of new schools and pre-kindergartens within our district, we feel that the need for a library within the confines of South Corona would be a very welcome addition to the local community. While the Corona and Lefrak branches have seen recent upgrades, the community at large would like a branch within the vicinity of PS14, the HS of Arts and Business, and several newly proposed pre k facilities all within the South Corona area. ","Community Boards are volunteer heavy organizations widely considered to be the City's front line of defense; we manage countless constituent issues, zoning variances, public meetings, and of course Needs Statements.  Despite this heavy responsibility, staffing for many CB's is grossly inadequate for the amount of work output, causing many of them to resort to interns as a primary source of help. Budget constraints have led many boards to maintain a maximum of 2-3 staff members, usually with only one full-timer. An increase in funding is sorely needed to increase current staffing.

Regardless of where our forefathers and foremothers originally lived, the great majority came to our country for a better life. The overwhelming majority of New Yorkers and Americans have some simple requests: to live in peace, in a safe community, with good public resources and services. Families and individuals continue to risk their lives to make it to a place like America. Whether our ancestors immigrated to escape violence, hunger, economic instability or oppressive governments we should be honored to live in a country that continues to feed the dreams of immigrants everywhere. In Queens, there are known to be more than two and a half million residents with ancestry from well over 100 countries. This has and will increase demands on us nationally and in our communities. This, combined with the pressure on our environment, will demand that we work together cooperatively and intelligently. We have our faults as individuals and as a nation, but we have strived to be a nation of the people, by the people, for the people, united under the belief in the Dream of a better life for ourselves,our loved ones and for future generations.  Since 2020, the Coronavirus (COVID-19) has caused the deaths of more than 1,062,000 Americans, and more that 42,000 NYC residents. In the Spring of 2020,  hospitals in Our City were overwhelmed with patients. Dedicated doctors, nurses and EMS workers risked their lives to care for very sick patients. There were many days when more than 700 New Yorkers died of this terrible virus. In addition to tragic deaths, the economy of the USA and in Our City was severely damaged, resulting in tens of millions seeking  unemployment insurance benefits and thousands of businesses not being able to operate. Thanks to New Yorkers wearing masks, social distancing themselves ,washing their hands regularly, and taking vaccines, the number of residents contracting this deadly disease has decreased dramatically. Drug companies thankfully have developed vaccines, which since Spring 2021 have become widely available. More than $3 trillion in relief has been distributed by the Federal government, causing national debt to skyrocket.  Our Community Board 5 area is comprised primarily of the Ridgewood, Maspeth, Middle Village and Glendale communities. We are also responsible for a few blocks of Woodside, Rego Park and Elmhurst. Our geographic boundaries are Maurice Avenue into Calamus Avenue to the north; the Brooklyn border with Bushwick on the south (Cypress Avenue ,Wyckoff Avenue and Irving Avenue); Woodhaven Boulevard and the CSX Freight Rail Line in the east and the Brooklyn County line with our Williamsburg and Bushwick neighbors in the west. Like many communities in Queens, development of homes and non-farm businesses began at the turn of the 20th century and continued quite industriously through the 1950's. By the time of America's first moon landing, our neighborhoods were overwhelmingly constructed.  The 2020 Census indicates that there are approximately 184,714 residents living within District 5, Queens, but, like many communities in our City, we know the number of people really living here is significantly greater, considering under-counting and far too many illegal apartments. Locally, our population on paper has risen from 150,000 residents in 1990. We have had some new housing constructed in the past two decades, essentially where one-family homes with large lots have been replaced by two-family homes or multiple dwellings. The housing stock in our communities is mainly comprised of attached homes, ranging from one to six-family residences. Our most pressing problems include: the tragic deaths of more than 42,000 New Yorkers and the devastating economic effects of the Coronavirus (COVID-19), significant increases in crime; illegal apartments, primarily in basements; too many drivers speeding, running traffic signals and stop signs; a significant reduction in the number of police officers assigned to the 104th Police Precinct since 1995; a growing number of sewer system breaks that cause dangerous roadway conditions; illegal dumping and abuse of city litter baskets; a shortage of Parks maintenance workers to keep playgrounds and ball fields in good repair; and too many youth not doing well in school. The need for many services historically provided by City agencies is growing for numerous reasons. It is due mainly to the age of specific communities' roadways, sewer lines, bridges and parks. These important assets must be well maintained or they will fall into serious disrepair, necessitating greater capital expenditures, sooner.  In an era when many City services had been cut back due to a declining tax base, volunteers have become the backbone of our community. Thank heavens for volunteers who serve diligently on Community Boards, not-for-profit organizations' boards of directors, civic organizations and block associations. Thanks to volunteers in the communities served by Community Board 5, Queens, children and teenagers are engaged in many sports and recreational activities, local parks are cleaner than they would be otherwise, and graffiti has been removed from many buildings. Many of the area needs that we have worked to accomplish for years seem much less consequential, after the September 11, 2001 disaster at the World Trade Center. Many families need psychological and financial assistance. Our world, in a devastating half-hour, is forever changed. The Police Department, who have done so much to reduce crime, will now be working increasingly with the FBI to greatly reduce the possibility of future terrorist disasters. After the Trade Center disaster, our wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have caused additional heartache throughout the country. Considering the severe economic recession that hit our country in 2008, the devastating economic impact of the Coronavirus Pandemic, and threats of severe government budget cuts in too many important funding categories, every effort must be made to ensure that government expenditures are prudent, that waste is reduced and that Medicaid, Medicare and other fraud are eliminated.  In the past 2 years, more than 130,000 asylum seekers and migrants have come to New York City, often without a place to live and bringing only what they can carry. This migration has overwhelmed our City Shelter System, is putting significant pressure on public schools and for other city resources.  Our city has had little help from the fereral government to pay for sheltering, feeding and educating these newcomers. In addition, the federal government needs to make provisions so that the new adult migrants are permitted to work,           ","","","","","Emergency and disaster response","","It is very difficult to state that there are 3 definite most important issues facing the communities that many of us have worked for decades to stabilize and improve. There is probably nothing more important to safeguard and improve than the air we share and the water we drink, since life is not possible without these essential resources. Sanitation services, removal and treatment of sewage, stormwater removal , health services and basic medicines are critical in preventing unhealthy conditions and disease.  Police are essential, as are Firefighters and EMS workers, to safeguard the people and for response to emergencies. People need to earn a living in order to pay for housing, to buy food and pay for essential services provided by the municipal government. A quality business environment is important so that the people are gainfully employed and earning enough income to at least meet their essential needs. Since the great majority of us do not have the luxury of walking to our place of employment, reliable, safe public transportation and stable, smooth roads, bridges and tunnels are vital for us to get where we need to go. Children, teens, young adults and all of us need to be increasingly educated and skilled to propel a civilized society in an ever more competitive, more global environment. Few of us are willing to live in tents, therefore quality, affordable housing is essential. Since living in a city presents fairly crowded conditions, where the great majority of us don't have our own private outdoor space, safe public parks provide important ""outdoor"" recreational space and, like cultural spaces, a place for people of all ages to communicate, socialize and rejuvinate.  All of the societal categories listed above are very important, so the questions are where is our city most in need at the current time, to our far from complete knowledge.      Emergency response is almost always the most important issue facing our Community Board area.  Having at least 170 Police Officers, plus supervisors, assigned to the 104th Police Precinct is our #1 expense budget priority. The number of Police Officers assigned to the 104th Police Precinct has declined by almost 30% in the past 25 years. This reduction forces officers and supervisors to hold more 911 calls, and too often has put our precinct in backlog and alert status, and forces police to too often take one 911 call after another. Since the start of the COVID-19 Pandemic in 2020, crime has increased dramatically in our city and in the communities we have worked to stabilize and improve. The 104th Police Precinct now has fewer than 150 Police Officers working to safeguard residents, workers and visitors in the communities of Ridgewood, Maspeth, Middle Village and Glendale. We need at least 170 Police Officers, exclusive of supervisors, to better reduce crime, to enforce traffic safety laws and curtail speeding drivers, and to patrol the communities in District 5, Queens more effectively. Even considering City budget difficulties resulting from health and economic costs caused by the Coronavirus Pandemic, beginning in March 2020, every effort must be made to at least keep the number of brave Firefighters and Officers, EMS Crews and Hospital Staffing  at pre-COVID levels. This tragic pandemic showed the need for these emergency response personnel in our large, ethnically diverse city.    ","Street flooding","","Street flooding is an ongoing pressing issue in Community District 5, Queens.  Solutions still need to be found to reduce flooding during heavy rains in the Glendale community. This includes the area of 77 Avenue and 78 Avenue, from 76 Street to 88 Street, and along Cooper Avenue from 74 Street to 78 Street.  Sewer capital projects will need to be funded to solve these flooding problems. We are informed that Project No. SE877 has finally been established to provide larger sewers in the Glendale community, especially for 77 Avenue, between 76 Street and 88 Street, which is the low point where storm water cascades downhill from Myrtle Avenue during rainstorms. The heavy rains of September 1, 2021 caused many homes along 77 Avenue to be flooded by more than 2 feet of storm water in basements. Therefore, city sewer upgrades in this low lying area of Glendale are more necessary than ever, especially considering the liklihood that global warming conditions will produce more heavy rainstorms in the future.    We have succeeded in obtaining funding from the N.Y. City Dept. of Environmental Protection budget for capital projects, to increase sewers capacity in the Penelope Avenue/74 Street area of Middle Village and in the Calamus Avenue/69 Street area on the Maspeth/Woodside border. It is imperative that the 77 Avenue Area of Glendale have sewers that can cope with heavy rains.     ","Traffic","","         Traffic and pedestrian safety have become much more of a concern in recent years. Too many drivers speed throughout our communities and our city, too many do not obey traffic signals and stop signs , and too many impatient, disrespectful drivers do not give pedestrians the right of way. We receive regular requests from community residents for traffic calming measures at corners and on residential blocks. We have consistently requested traffic signals and ""all way stop"" designations to improve pedestrian and driver safety. Since the great majority of intersections in our communities already have what the N.Y. City Department of Transportation considers to be adequate traffic controls, there are more and more residential requests for speed bumps or even traffic direction changes to deter drivers from speeding in communities.  Traffic conditions are compounded in recent years with many more people travelling city streets on motorbikes, scooters and  battery propelled bicycles.  Too many people using these lighter transportation choices do not stop at traffic signals, or stop signs, putting others, especially pedestrians, and themselves, at risk of serious injury. Too many of these drivers of smaller vehicles even drive on city sidewalks putting pedestrians at even further risk. We need enforcement, and we also need drivers to be more educated, respectful to pedestrians and other drivers. Traffic conditions are even more stressed with tractor trailers, smaller trucks and delivery vehicles too often speeding and not obeying traffic laws throughout our city.  ","","","","","Services for domestic violence victims","","The Coronavirus (COVID-19), which started ravaging NYC in early 2020, is the equivalent of a plague which has caused more than 42,000 deaths in Our City and more than 1,062,000 deaths in the USA.  In Our City, incidents of this dastardly virus have been reduced dramatically. Fortunately vaccines became available beginning in early 2021.Unfortunately too many people in our Nation refused to get vaccinated. We have many freedoms, but when so many people live and work in close proximity to others refusing to be vaccinated, when the COVID vaccines have proven to be very safe is not responsible. Much of what needs to be done to stem this virus is for people to be vaccinated. This terrible, deadly virus would have caused many more deaths if responsible people didn't wear masks, social distance and cleanse their hands often. In the short term, this deadly virus may have been the most important issue facing all of us worldwide. Yet, domestic violence problems and the need for better mental health treatment are critical issues that will need to be solved ongoing, whether there is a COVID-19 pandemic or some other major health crisis..   All of the above listed issues are important, but Domestic Violence is the issue that is likely the most pressing, as this problem results in many 911 responses by Police. Mental Health Issues and substance abuse are also very important to address, as these problems are the cause of much domestic violence and criminal activity. The USA has been too violent for far too long, especially when one considers that violent crime rates in the great majority of other  ""industrialized countries"" are much lower. Too often violence , meanness and the degradation of women is almost glorified in music, movies, video games and other entertainment. There are too many negative vs. positive influences afflicting society.  Respect for others ,especially men for women, is essential to reduce abuse & domestic violence.     A significant concern is that, according to the last N.Y. City Community Health Survey in 2012, approximately 239,000 adults living in N.Y. City have problems with Serious Mental Illness, but only about 60% of these people in need have received mental health treatment in the past year.  There seems to be a large gap between the number of people needing mental health treatment and the availability of this important treatment. There are reportedly also critical affordability issues for many people in need of mental health treatment, either because they are not adequately insured or because they haven't the necessary insurance or funds to pay for treatment that is often critically needed.","Ridgewood Medical Center,now renamed Gotham Health/Cumberland, located at 769 Onderdonk Avenue in Ridgewood, is a NYC Health and Hospitals Corporation facility that now serves residents of all ages. This Center is needed for poor and low-income residents of Ridgewood and neighboring communities. Once known as the Maspeth Child Health Station, and then Ridgewood Communicare Health Center, thousands of children, ages newborn to six, received health services here for decades. The fact that residents of all ages can now receive health care at this neighborhood site is very important, especially for school-age children who might not see a doctor otherwise. Additional hours of operation should be added, especially on evenings and Saturdays, to meet increased demand and parent working hours.  Elmhurst Hospital, an HHC facility located outside of the CB5Q area, has a very good reputation for a City Hospital. This standing is even more impressive when one considers the diverse ethnic make-up of the people served at this hospital. Quality care and renovations at Elmhurst Hospital are very important to all of Queens. While Wyckoff Heights Medical Center and St. John's Hospital had been the primary health sites for CB5Q area residents, we are in Elmhurst Hospital's catchment area and are dependent upon this hospital's emergency room in critical times. The closures in 2009 of both St. John's Queens Hospital and Mary Immaculate Hospital could severely hurt health care in Queens. Every effort should be made to replace these hospitals with medical facilities, if doing so as hospitals is cost-prohibitive. Bureau of Pest Control inspection and extermination services are an important priority. With as many or more rats in the City as people, it is very short-sighted and potentially dangerous to fund this arm of the Health Department at inadequate levels. ","The neighborhoods of Community District 5, Queens have a very large senior citizen population and many of these seniors are living into their late seventies and eighties. As a result, there is more of a need than ever for ""Meals on Wheels"", transportation and other services for the frail elderly. Congregate meals programs continue to be important, so that seniors get to socialize, exercise and receive good hot meals. Caregiver Programs that give comfort and free time to family members who care for frail seniors are also very important, especially considering how these family members have saved government so much cost of nursing homes and other types of formal care. Alzheimer's Programs and other mental health services are a critical need, as many seniors are living well into their eighties. Housing for seniors is another important need. Well-supervised nursing homes, where background checks are done to prevent abuse of senior citizen residents, is essential. The Coronavirus Pandemic (COVID-19) caused senior centers the close in March 2020. Thousands of seniors have tragically died from this devastating virus in NY City alone. Senior meals were being delivered to the great majority of those who had eaten and enjoyed activities at the senior center. A significant concern is that, because of this deadly virus and seniors being most at-risk, seniors have become more isolated. This isolation from loved ones is mentally and emotionally harmful to seniors.  Many seniors need transportation to medical appointments. This is especially true for frail, low-income seniors, who should likely be given priority for any Access-A-Ride type programs and any pilot programs for seniors unable to take public transportation. ","The homeless population in New York City and the lack of affordable housing for many New Yorkers is a serious concern. Yet, any plans to build large facilities to warehouse the homeless or to pack homeless people into hotels is unwise. There are still a large number of vacant buildings and lots, where residents without homes can have a place to live. This requires renovation and new construction. Why not hire professionals to teach people who are without a stable place to live to renovate and/or build housing for themselves? This would provide more housing at lower cost while teaching people a skill at the same time. Providing rent subsidies through thoughtful, carefully run programs to those who are at risk of becoming homeless, or those individuals already struggling to live in the homeless shelter system, is likely one of the best solutions to housing the homeless and those at risk of homelessness. Rent subsidies need to be combined with quality counseling, education, employment, substance abuse prevention/intervention services, domestic violence services and mental health services if those at risk are to really be helped now and for the longer term. The provision of professional legal services for people being harassed by landlords and/or in danger of eviction from their apartment is an important need in an effort to prevent homelessness. Some of the good news, according to the N.Y. Dept. of Homeless Services, is that evictions are down 27% in the past year, and family homelessness has been reduced in the past year, for the first time in a decade. There has been a surge, since 2022, of migrants entering the U.S.A. at our southern border. As of mid-October, 2023, more than 130,000 migrants have come to New York City seeking work and a place to live. These people are primarily fleeing countries like Venezuela and Central American countries where they are escaping violence and governments that are either oppressive, corrupt and/or incompetent. The influx of these people has greatly increased the number of people that need services through the N.Y. City Dept. of Homeless Services and the Human Resources Administration. Assistance is needed from the federal government to provide for these people in the short term, so that they can become independent and earn a living to support themselves and their families. The federal government has not provided much funding to New York City and other localities to help with the expense of housing, educating and providing food for these migrants. The federal government needs to provide our City and others with more financial assistance and these migrants need to be granted work authorization. ","Responsible provisions for those in need is important in a civilized, overly competitive society. While the number of people in NYC receiving public assistance has been reduced in recent years, the societal safety net is important. Too many people are unemployed, under employed and lack education levels and skills necessary to obtain a job in which they earn enough to pay for food, and housing, medical insurance, doctor visits, clothing, utilities and other basic needs.  The loss of manufacturing jobs in the USA has meant that opportunities are lacking, in too many situations, Jobs have been transferred by USA companies to other countries, where work environments are unhealthy, unsafe, and where workers, some as young as teens are earning $1. an hour, working 16 hours a day ( I.E. Apple Products made at Foxcon) and sleeping in barracks like conditions. It would be better for the people of the USA, and cities like New York if companies and their stockholders were much less greedy. Manufacturing jobs should at long last be brought back to the USA, so that our citizens can be gainfully employed and people paid a living wage for their efforts. In the great majority of cases, crime , despair , substance abuse and mental health problems are highest in those communities where unemployment and underemployment is all too much the norm. The bottom line is that, for too long, increased corporate profits may have meant more income for some but has reduced opportunities for the great majority of our people. This is becoming more and more of a national security issue.  Food stamps, housing subsidies and medicaid are essential for far too many, and need to be provided for those truly in need. This need would be greatly diminished if manufacturing employment was brought back to the USA. Another problem is that in too many cases skilled jobs may be available (i.e. construction, plumbing, electrical), but there are not enough people with the necessary skills to fill these employment opportunities. Employment training, with a priority in marketable fields, is very important. A 4 year college diploma is certainly not the only path to a good living and teaching people trade skills should be a priority. For instance, recent news reports state that more than 50,000 new truck drivers will be needed each year for at least a decade, to transport food and goods in a timely manner. Sadly, many of the most vulnerable residents are senior citizens, who are faced with soaring housing expenses, and too often have to chose between paying for essential medicines instead of healthy food and other necessities. Safeguarding at-risk elderly citizens is vital in a civilized society. ","","","","","Educational attainment","","Far too many children and teens are performing below grade level in too many schools.  What kind of a future will they have if they are not reasonably well educated, and at least secure a high school diploma? Not everyone is academically inclined, and many are much more interested in learning a skill (i.e. Electrical, plumbing, carpentry, automotive repair and food services), but without at least a high school diploma obtaining any employment paying a living wage is very difficult.    Young people need to prize learning more, but many of their influences are negative like music, movies, social media and television that promote entertainment and disrespect instead of learning.     After school tutoring programs have been one of the best services that help children and teens to learn in a smaller setting &. boost their confidence.  The Coronavirus Pandemic (COVID-19) caused schools throughout NYC, and much of the USA to close during March, 2020. Students had to learn remotely from home. This caused parents in many cases to substitute for teachers, and many children and teens did not have access to the internet or a computer at home and in homeless shelter residences.  Our City had to quickly provide both ipad computers and/or internet access for several hundred thousand students.  There is little doubt that the education of too many children and teenagers has been set back as a result of their not being able to attend school until September of 2020. There is concern, especially for Special Needs Students and students needing occupational and other therapies.  Fortunately, thus far, as of late October 2023, there has been a relatively low rate of students or education staff contracting the virus. Our society will have much ground to make up to get millions or students performing well.  ","Overcrowding in our local schools has been a great concern throughout Community School District 24, of which the communities of CB5 Queens are a major part. Historically, Community School District 24 has been among the most overcrowded in the City. While this is not true in all neighborhoods, it has certainly been a problem in the Ridgewood community. In the past 10 years, we have seen the completion of two new public schools in Ridgewood, one on Metropolitan Avenue at Tonsor Street, P.S. 290; and another one on Seneca Avenue at DeKalb Avenue, P.S. 320. In the past 15 years we have also seen the completion of two new schools: at PS 128 and another at PS 305, as well as school additions at I.S. 77, P.S. 49, P.S. 87 and P.S. 113. A new high school opened on Metropolitan Avenue, east of Woodhaven Boulevard, in September, 2010. Because of the need for additional space for high school students, construction of a new high school on 74 Street at 57 Avenue, in Maspeth, for 1,100 students, was completed in September 2012. Considering the need for high school education space locally, CB5Q requests that a new high school be constructed in Queens. The Department of Education plans to construct new schools, mini-schools and school additions are much needed, considering current and projected classroom overcrowding. The education of children, pre-teens and teenagers has suffered when attempts are made to teach in gyms and auditoriums. Plans for new schools should consider adjacent residential and business communities. In general, the Mayor, elected officials and the NYC Department of Education must strategically prioritize the provision of adequate learning space and the ongoing, regular repair and maintenance of educational facilities. ","There are few issues in life that are more upsetting and more alarming than children being abused, especially by their parents or a family member. The fact that there are 55,000 cases of child abuse or neglect annually in N.Y. City indicates the enormous pressure on the Administration for Children's Services to intervene, to safeguard the well-being and life of children and teenagers. The immediate priority is that there are enough competent case workers and supervisors to respond to reports of abuse or neglect and to provide ongoing case monitoring. Education in parenting is lacking and an important need to fulfill, especially related to the responsibilities of fatherhood. Recruiting and securing commitments from caring foster care parents is very important. Some good news is that, according to the N.Y. City Administration for Children's Services, they have improved their ratio of Child Protective Specialists/Case Workers to better than 1:12 for family cases in N.Y. City and in some situations, where cases are more critical, the ratio of Child Protective Specialists to families is as low as 1:8 or 1:4. Even considering the City budget difficulties due to the negative economic effects and public health strains due to COVID-19 in 2020 and 2021, it is important that funding for the Administration for Children's Services be maintained at sufficient levels to provide a good ratio of case workers to victims of abuse,and to continue to prioritize needed child protection, and abuse prevention services.  After School and Evening Youth Programs are critically important to reduce youth delinquency and build self-esteem among children and teenagers. These valuable programs and activities are one of the main reasons that crime in New York City decreased significantly in the years before the COVID Pandemic started in 2020.  Thankfully these programs and activities have been very well funded by City taxpayers in the past 10 years or more.  With so many young people performing below grade level in reading and math, which has become more of an issue because of the COVID Pandemic, having after school tutoring provided by honest, competent not-for-profit organizations can significantly help students to perform better in school and succeed in life.          ","","","","","General crime","","While crime had been reduced greatly in NYC during the past 2 decades, prior to 2020, crime has increased significantly in the past 3 years. Our dedicated 104th Police Precinct officers and supervisors are very busy answering 911 calls and 311 calls, especially on the 4pm-Midnights Tour and the Midnights to 8am Tour.  A very serious concern is that there are currently fewer than 140 Police Officers, exclusive of Supervisors, working in the 104 Police Precinct. A critical concern is how often Police need to respond to situations related to the possibility of domestic violence. Other problems, which Police often can't give sufficient attention to, include too many drivers speeding and not giving pedestrians respect; illegal truck traffic, problem party venues and illegal parking. Officers and Supervisors in the 104th Police Precinct have been stressed even more, and resources have been drained, due to assaults and other problems related to the men's shelter on Cooper Avenue in Glendale.  In 2020, crime escalated throughout the City of New York. Shootings and murders skyrocketed in many parts of Our City in 2020, which is the year of Bail Reform, the Coronavirus (COVID-19) and the tragic killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis by a Police Officer. There have been hundreds of protests, which in Our City have mostly been peaceful, but there have been instances of abuse of Police Officers and looting.  Relationships between Police Departments and residents in many of our inner cities nationally needs to improve. And real discussion and Police efforts to diminish the relatively small number of Police Officers who are causing unnecessary deaths and abuse of residents needs to be accomplished.   It is very important to remember that dedicated Police Officers and Supervisors have much stress in performing their jobs. They bravely protect lives and property throughout Our City and Nation, and should be respected..  In the 104th Police Precinct, which covers Ridgewood, Maspeth, Middle Village and Glendale in Queens, major index crime rose more than 30% during 2022.   We need new Police Academy Classes to begin training, to replenish the NYC Police force who are retiring more than expected. NYPD efforts to recruit beginning in high school could help efforts to obtain good candidates.  Well trained anti-crime police officers and supervisors are needed to catch criminals carrying weapons, especially guns. It is imperative that we not have a revolving door for criminals in the judicial system. Too many people with histories of committing crime have been released soon after they were arrested. Judges need to be able and willing to order violent criminals and recidivist perpetrators of crime to be kept in jail. We need a judicial system that is much more efficient, so that those awaiting trial do not spend far too many months in jail on Rikers Island, where they too often become more hardened criminals.       ","Some capital improvements have been performed at the 104th Police Precinct, including: a new roof, boiler replacement, plumbing system upgrades, renovation of locker rooms, bathrooms and a new assembly room. Additional improvements needed are: upgrades to the old, often malfunctioning waste system, ungrades to the supervisor's bathroom on the first floor and the 2nd floor male bathroom, upgrades to the prisoner's bathroom, replacement of deteriorated  and dangerous windows posing a safety hazard, expanding the female supervisor's locker room, providing access for the handicapped, reburbishing the main desk, correcting the problem of leaks in the basement, a new garage compressor so that Police vehicle tires can be filled on-site, installation of cameras for the area on Shaler where evidence and accident vehicles are stored  and painting the entire precinct.   Crime has increased alarmingly in our city. Violent crime, robbery and quality of life remain the first concern of most New Yorkers.  Efforts to win the crime war have included, acquiring the Robbery Identification Unit at the 104th Precinct, advocacy for more police officers and communities working with those police officers, removal of a great deal of graffiti from buildings, and providing after school and weekend education, sports and recreation programs.  The residents of the Community Board 5, Queens area need the following resources and the police cooperation to effectively fight crime in the areas served by the 104th Precinct: • 170 Police Officers; 21 Sergeants; 7 Lieutenants; 2 Captains • Robbery ID Unit, considering Bushwick border and commercial areas • A well run Precinct Detective Unit • Sufficient, well conditioned patrol vehicles, scooters, bicycles, 4-wheel drive vehicles and vans for Police to effectively patrol. To reduce crime now and into the future, some of the needs include: • Better attentiveness to juvenile crime • Stiff prison sentences for the most violent criminals and more structured detention for auto thieves, pickpockets and substance abusers • Long-term prison sentences for those convicted of dealing in quantities of heroin, crack and other hard drugs • Attention to the physical condition of the 104th Police Precinct and the morale of the officers, who do not work in the most enviable conditions. Illegal truck traffic continues to create havoc throughout our city. This problem needs more attention from the NYPD, DOT and other responsible agencies. ","The condition of buildings that serve Fire Department Engine Companies and Ladder Companies is critical. An example of problems that can arise from lack of capital improvement to fire houses has been seen most recently when the fire companies located at the house on Grand Avenue, just west of Queens Boulevard in Elmhurst, had to be relocated. It is imperative that capital improvements to the structures and apparatus floors of all fire houses be performed expeditiously, based on problems reported by engine and ladder companies and inspections done by qualified engineers. Regular ongoing replacement of Engine Company and Ladder Company fire fighting vehicles must be a City priority. To our knowledge, funding was available to provide Fire Department apparatus with exhaust connections that are state of the art, to provide minimal danger to firefighters' health in the fire houses. It is critical that these new exhaust connections be installed, and maintained, in all fire houses. Professional fire protection is absolutely essential in urban areas. The risk of reduced services in the Fire Department can be disastrous. Those living in Ridgewood and adjacent communities remember well when the nearby Bushwick, Brooklyn community was devastated by fire in the 1970's.  Fire Prevention is an important concern. With the growing number of illegal occupancies in residential buildings, it is more important that the Fire Department play a greater role in curbing this problem. Often times a Building Department or Housing inspector cannot gain access to a building that has one or more illegal apartments, but access will less likely be refused to firefighters. There are also serious concerns about reductions in the number of firefighters that go out on each run to a fire scene, both planned and reductions that have already occurred (roster manning). This can endanger the public as well as the firefighters.  Emergency Medical Services (Ambulances) are a top priority of the members of Community Board 5, Queens. The time that it takes for an ambulance to get a person to the emergency room of a hospital can be the difference in life and death. Well trained EMS workers and properly maintained ambulances are of the utmost importance. We have been most fortunate to have the Ridgewood, Middle Village and Glendale Volunteer Ambulance Corps working in cooperation with EMS ","","","","","Sewer capacity","","There has been extensive street and basements flooding in portions of District 5, Queens, during heavy rains. Considering ongoing environmental pressures globally and in the USA,  where we have witnessed more violent weather in recent years, infrastructure upgrades are vital.  On 8/8/2007, for instance, we had 4 plus inches of rain locally in 45 minutes. On 8/15/2012, we were  flooded with 3 inches of storm water in just 30 minutes. On 8/7/2018, heavy rains caused extensive street and basement flooding in our communities. Most recently, on 9/1/2021, 6 inches of rain fell in portions of our City and in September, 2022 there was another heavy rainstorm in a short period of time. As a result, significant parts of Glendale, Maspeth, Middle Village & even Ridgewood were overwhelmed by flooding. With forecasts of continued global warming, we better be well prepared.      Solutions to flooding problems during moderate to heavy rainstorms are especially needed in the Glendale community, along  77 Avenue and 78 Avenue from 76 Street to 88 Street (SE 877). We urge the NY City Departments of Environmental Protection and Design and Construction to prioritize design and construction of this and other new sewer projects in this area of Glendale, especially considering that, during the heavy rainstorm of 9/1/2021, many homeowners along 77 Avenue, in Glendale, were overwhelmed with more than 2 feet of storm water in their basements.   During the past 4 years we have had 3 major sewers projects under construction in District 5, Queens, to eliminate or greatly reduce flooding conditions by providing greater sewers capacity. One of these sewers projects is in the Penelope Avenue/74 Street area of Middle Village, where, during heavy rains, many home basements had been flooded with more than a foot of storm water. This critical project was completed in 2020. Another significant sewers construction project is in the Calamus Avenue/69 Street area of Maspeth and Woodside, and this project was completed in 2019. Currently a micro-tunneling sewers project is progressing toward completion in the 70th Street/Grand Avenue, in Maspeth.","Every effort must be made to maintain the high quality of the drinking water available to NY City residents. Travelling to other localities, City residents can take pride in the fact that they can still ""turn on the tap"" and pour an excellent glass of drinking water. Completion of the Third Water Tunnel and the system that will bring water from this tunnel to residents and businesses is very important. Many of us were fearful of plans for hydrofracking in New York State, which could have disastrous effects on our prized drinking water and environment. The effects of this high volume deep drilling for energy sources has ruined the environment severely in other states. Hydrofracking plans may pose one of the greatest threats to our environment in our lifetime. Thank goodness fracking is now banned in N.Y. State.  While the water system in our City is quite good, the sewer system is another matter entirely. Cave-in conditions on local streets and main arteries are very often caused by sewer line breaks or problems with manhole structures. Sunken and broken corner catch basins can go unrepaired for months at a time. The Community Board consistently reports clogged catch basins and sewer lines that need to be cleaned and flushed. The City must make the repair of broken sewer lines, fire hydrants and catch basins a significant priority, and catch basin cleaning needs to be performed on a more regular basis, considering global warming threats and the liklihood of severe rain storms more regularly. Personnel to perform this work must be hired. Efforts to get the public and businesses to stop littering and dumping into catch basins are important.  Air pollution and noise pollution are important concerns as well. Part of the solution is enforcement. Street tree plantings are a great means to reduce air pollution. An excellent public transit system is another important means of reducing air pollution, especially train service. Ongoing efforts are needed for building owners to upgrade to less polluting heating systems. We also need to have stringent regulations for truck emissions and for freight train emissions, as we do for our motor vehicles. ","Illegal dumping has become a terrible problem in our communities , and probably one of the primary reasons that businesses, especially manufacturers and distributors, have left the City for so called greener pastures. Thankfully, the Queens District 5 Sanitation force has done a great deal to get dumping locations cleaned as expeditiously as possible, given fairly limited resources. Sanitation Police 'stake-outs' of dumping sites must be a priority. Littering has also become a growing menace, as has the preponderance of residents who feel free to dump their household trash in and around the City litter baskets. The reason that Community Boards are consistently requesting that catch basins be cleaned and sewer lines flushed, in so many locations, is the degree of littering done in the catch basin and on the street.  For the most part, refuse and recycling collection is consistent and respectful in QW5. Snow removal had been quite efficient during the storms of recent years, but there were potentially serious snow accumulations that went unaddressed for days during the winter of 2015/2016. Mechanical broom sweeping of Ridgewood, parts of Maspeth and Glendale, along with the help of caring residents, keeps the area reasonably clean except where illegal dumping and litter occurs. Collection of sanitation litter baskets,on our busy commercial strips, needs to be performed 7 days a week. Recycling at schools is where many problems are caused in the community. Bagged food cans and other recyclables can't be stored in schools, so custodial staff put the bags on the sidewalks adjacent to the schools, causing an eyesore and encouraging illegal dumping. The Sanitation Department needs to schedule pick-ups for recyclables at many schools daily. Five-Day-A-Week School Garbage Collection is a top priority for District 5, in Queens.  The QW5 area is still plagued with illegal dumping, primarily in out of the way areas (adjacent to the LIRR/CSX, and where industry must flourish). The Sanitation Department has successfully worked to diminish this once overwhelming scourge, but too often QW5 staff must return time after time to clean up dump sites. Too many of the people living in New York are abusing our city and this needs to change. Sanitation Police must give more priority to 'staking-out' dumping sites (especially between 10pm and 6am), seizing vehicles, getting dumpers fined, and publicizing the names of those convicted in major media. ","","","","","Building code and/or zoning enforcement","","Building code enforcement continues to be one of our most important Expense Budget Priorities, since there are far too many residents living in illegal apartments and ongoing issues regarding construction without proper permits. In the past 5 years, the Ridgewood community has seen buildings purchased by speculators who have pushed tenants out or bought them out, so that they can obtain much higher rents. Affordable housing, especially for those renting, is a growing problem, most recently in Ridgewood where ""runners"" have reportedly gotten landlords to sell primarily 6 family houses, so that renovations can be made and rents can too often be doubled unfairly. Tenants, who have lived in these multiple dwellings for years, often decades, are being pushed out of their apartments.     It is probably no small coincidence that there are approximately 250 people in the NYC homeless Shelter system, who give their last address as somewhere in the Community Board 5, Queens area.  The scenario seems to be that people get pushed out of their apartments, which were in today's times affordable, by speculators under questionable corporate disguises, and city taxpayers have to pay exorbitant costs to shelter more and more families and individuals.. There is much that is terribly wrong, and possibly very corrupt with this story. This is all compounded by the fact that the Dept. of City Planning has achieved a M1 Hotels and Motels Zoning Text Amendment, which contains a provision for the use of properties zoned for manufacturing, for the so called public good.       Community Board 5, Queens has submitted a Proposed Rezoning of Ridgewood, Queens to the N.Y. City Dept. of City Planning, in an effort to better safeguard this pressured community from overdevelopment and development that is out- of- character with the surrounding community. Many of us thought that we had protected the community when Ridgewood was approved for contextual zoning changes back in 2000. But, with the housing market as hot as it is, some recent property owners are getting permits to add height to buildings in portions of Ridgewood that are part of the Ridgewood State and Federal Historic District, but have still not received protective N.Y. City Landmarks Status. Much more of Ridgewood should receive N.Y. City Landmarks Designation.      Employment is essential, if adults are to be capable of paying for food, housing, clothing, utilities and other essentials, and, of course, the development of quality businesses is vital so that those who are not the entrepreneurs have a place to earn a living. Efforts to give teens and young adults learning and skill opportunities, so that they can be gainfully employed, is critical.  A good college education is important for most in our increasingly complex, competitive world, but college is not the best choice for everyone. Much more emphasis needs to be placed on giving teenagers and young adults an opportunity to learn valuable trades in high schools.","One of biggest risks locally has become large party venues trying to open in buildings zoned for manufacturing. At 52-19 Flushing Av., in Maspeth, the property owner had applied for a cabaret liquor license to serve up to 5,000 patrons, at a large site that provided manufacturing employment for many years. Preliminary plans by the City Council and Mayor to safeguard manufacturing districts from these party place assaults need to become law. We have worked diligently with civic leaders and the Dept. of City Planning, during the past 15 years, to safeguard the character of the Ridgewood, Maspeth, Middle Village and Glendale communities. Our communities needed protection from overdevelopment, which we thought was accomplished. The great majority of the Community Board 5, Queens area has obtained contextural zoning designations , but there are new overdevelopment pressures in our neighborhoods. While many areas of our Community Board area have been rezoned since 2000, more needs to be done to safeguard our communities from overdevelopment, and development that is out of character with the surrounding community. CB5Q has submitted proposals to the N.Y. City Dept. of City Planning to better safeguard the Myrtle Avenue and Fresh Pond Road commercial corridors, in Ridgewood, residential areas in Ridgewood and manufacturing areas. We have met with Dept. of City Planning representatives regarding our rezoning proposals and are hopeful that they will help us safeguard neighborhood character. ","Affordable housing is more at risk than anytime in decades,especially in the Ridgewood, Queens community. There is a growing, greedy trend for the price of 6 family houses and multiple dwellings generally to be bid up by speculators. ""Runners"", representing clandestine investors, are reportedly getting more and more property owners to sell buildings, at inflated prices , by forcing long-time tenants out and/or buying them out. Once the apartments can be renovated, our knowledge is that the property owner can recoup their investment in just 40 months and the tenant's rent can rise deploringly from $1,000. monthly to more than double that amount. The Ridgewood community was known for affordable housing, especially in 6 family multiple dwelling buildings, but that was before speculators, operating under very questionable corporate disguises, pushed tenants out of their apartments. Greatly increased legal, legislative and enforcement efforts are needed to prevent landlords from harassing tenants, to increase penalties against landlords who stop providing essential services or who abuse tenants, and to provide legal services to tenants being harassed by greedy landlords or tenants at risk of losing their apartments. ","Probably the major reason that New York City has had significant problems balancing a budget revolves around the fact that manufacturing and non-service employment has declined astronomically during the past several decades. With this decline in manufacturing and non-service employment related jobs, the number of residents receiving public assistance had risen to alarming heights. The current administration should focus on job development and bring manufacturing back to our City. All too often, we hear about how the City has virtually given-up on the manufacturing sector to boost employment and the tax-base. This effort will no doubt require a great deal of cooperation with Federal and State government, but must be done. Community Board 5, Queens, in July, 2013 , overwhelmingly voted in favor of a Proposed Industrial Business Zone (IBZ) in the Ridgewood area, South of Myrtle Avenue, that is zoned M1-4 and M1-4D. This IBZ has been approved, and implementation of this IBZ designation should help to stabilize and increase manufacturing locally, with good marketing and coordination. In District 5, Queens, we once had one of the largest concentrations of knitting mills in the United States. The knitting industry has historically been associated with the Ridgewood community. Locally, this very important industry has declined, but with the proper support, the garment manufacturing business in Ridgewood and other communities can flourish once again.  The West Maspeth Industrial Area is also very important to the community and our City. Retention of industry in this section of our community has always been a priority of Community Board 5. We have shown our commitment by consistently pushing for improved roadway and sewer conditions in this section of the community. There are four major commercial streets in the Community Board 5, Queens area. Myrtle Avenue in Ridgewood and Glendale stretches from the Brooklyn border all the way to Cooper Avenue. Myrtle Avenue has seen a resurgence in recent years, thanks in large part to the efforts of the Ridgewood Local Development Corporation and the establishment of the Myrtle Avenue Business Improvement District, from Wyckoff Avenue to Fresh Pond Road, in Ridgewood. Grand Avenue in Maspeth, Fresh Pond Road in Ridgewood and Metropolitan Avenue in Middle Village are also important commercial strips. Community Board 5, Queens has important capital budget priorities, requesting capital budget funding for the Reconstruction of Sidewalks, Curbs and Pedestrian Ramps Along Myrtle Avenue, from Fresh Pond Road to Wyckoff Avenue; to Reconstruct Fresh Pond Road from Myrtle Avenue to Eliot Avenue; and to Improve the Myrtle Avenue Commercial Strip in Glendale. These budget priorities are listed in the Transportation Section (Section 8) of this Statement of Community District Needs and Community Board Budget Requests. ","","","","","Traffic safety and enforcement (cars, scooters, ebikes, etc.)","","In a society where moving large numbers of people is so vital, public transportation, roads, bridges and traffic safety must be priorities. Traffic safety applies to each of these priorities in a broad sense, and, specifically related to the motor vehicle, our Community Board must consistently request traffic and pedestrian safety studies to safeguard pedestrians and attempt to calm motor vehicle and truck operators. Our community board has successfully led the effort to reconstruct or substantially renovate the train stations in the area we cover, and we have pushed for roadway resurfacing and reconstruction, including along Grand Avenue and Myrtle Avenue overnight; and we were very successful in the acquisition of new natural gas buses locally, but our most pressing matters are requests for traffic and pedestrian safety improvements.   Traffic congestion seems to be growing by the month. We are seeing the backups more than ever. The most difficult and dangerous intersections in District 5, Queens include Woodhaven Boulevard at Union Turnpike, Metropolitan Avenue at Fresh Pond Road, Myrtle Avenue at Wyckoff Avenue, Grand Avenue at 69 Street and both 69 Street and Grand Avenue at the Long Island Expressway Eastbound and Westbound Service Roads. The Eastbound Long Island Expressway is backed up until past 7pm many evenings. As a result of too many drivers selfishly speeding and not giving pedestrians their right-of-way, our Community Board submits dozens of requests each year, asking the NYC Dept. of Transportation to study streets to improve traffic and pedestrian safety. Traffic is named first, primarily due to the growing number of large and smaller motor vehicles traveling far exceeding the number of walkers during most of each hectic day. Having pushed for traffic signals and ""All Way Stops"" to better safeguard pedestrians and drivers, and succeeded in working with NYCDOT to see needs met, we have almost exhausted locations for these control devices. So, in more recent months, we are evaluating many more requests and study results for ""Speed Bumps"". Not many years ago, speed bumps were almost only installed in NY City on school blocks. Too many residents are fearful of more vehicles speeding along their residential blocks. Children playing in the street is an unfortunate distant memory.","The following are or should be priorities of the NYC/DOT: • Allocate adequate resources for Traffic Safety Studies, installation of All-Way Stops, One-Ways, Warning Signage ,Traffic Signals, and Speed Bumps. • Doubling from one to two daily, the number of crews Queens Division of Road Repair sends out to repair serious roadway defects and pot holes. • Having Arterial Highways free of dangerous conditions and cleaned more frequently. • Make Roadway Resurfacing an on-going priority so as to greatly reduce the roads ""rated 7 or worse"". • Improve Bridge Maintenance so that costly replacement does not become imminent, and Replace Deteriorated Bridge Structures (i.e. Grand Street Bridge Over Newtown Creek). • Provide adequate numbers of Traffic Control Agents (NYPD) assigned to bridge entry points and other congested areas (especially major construction detour routes). • Reducing truck traffic problems throughout our City.  An important need is for Safer Passage for Pedestrians and Bicyclists to and from the Ridgewood Reservoir, which is a beautiful nature preserve in Highland Park, Needs include installation of sidewalks along portions of Cypress Avenue, between Cooper Avenue and Cypress Hills Street, and along Vermont Place from Cypress Avenue and Highland Boulevard. Conditions are dangerous because of the heavy traffic going to and from the Jackie Robinson Parkway. A bicycle lane should also be considered, if it could be a safety improvement. ","Ongoing Rehabilitation of our public transit system is critical to the health and vitality of the City of New York. If not for our extensive subway and elevated train line service, air pollution would be much worse and street traffic even more hazardous and gridlocked. Track beds, rails, signal systems, elevated line supports, platforms and stations must be upgraded, rehabilitated and maintained on an ongoing basis. The BMT-M elevated train line, the BMT-L and IND lines are the trains that primarily serve residents of the CB5 area. Specific capital improvement needs include: • Reconstruct DeKalb Avenue, Halsey Street and Jefferson Street Train Stations (BMT-L Line). Only the Halsey Street Train Station is in Queens, but many of our Ridgewood residents either use these stations, or would use them, if they were not so deteriorated and if they were more inviting. An elevator is needed at the busy DeKalb Avenue station. • Improve Myrtle/Wyckoff Transit Hub (to include overdue painting of the M Train Structure to prevent deterioration). There had been a great need for extensive Reconstruction of the BMT-L and BMT-M Train Transit Hub at Myrtle and Wyckoff Avenues, which had not been improved in decades. The long-awaited station reconstruction project finally began in 2005, and was completed in 2008. Unfortunately, until 2020 nothing had been done to repair and paint the elevated M Train structure, which is needed to prevent further deterioration and to enhance the M Line and station aesthetics. We have also seen the completion of a project for increased street lighting, a canopy for waiting bus riders and other improvements along Palmetto Street between Myrtle Avenue and St. Nicholas Avenue. This Intermodal Project is 95% complete. This section of Palmetto Street is an integral part of the Myrtle/Wyckoff Transit Hub, where many City buses pick up and drop off commuters, as their first and last stop on the bus route. Other important needs regarding public transportation include: • Replace air-polluting diesel engine buses with new cleaner fuel and/or hybrid buses. • Ongoing upgrades to train tracks, signal systems and switching systems. The Coronavirus (COVID-19), which started to have a devastating effect in our City by April, 2020 , has resulted in more than 42,000 deaths in New York City, 1,062,000 deaths in America and has severly hurt the U.S.A. economy, where we have had more cases per capita than almost anywhere in the industrialized world.  The revenues of the MTA and the N.Y. City Transit Authority are down drastically, from Pre-COVID levels.  There have been several Federal Stimulas packages to help reduce economic burdens for individuals, workers and businesses. The MTA states that we need at least another $10 billion in short-term Federal Mass Transit Assistance, if there is hope of avoiding mass layoffs and severe reductions in public train and bus service. Public Transit is part of the economic lifeblood of New York City and surrounding localities, and our City and these localities are integral to the economic well-being of the U.S.A. ","","","","","Quality of parks and park facilities","","In an increasingly crowded city, where the great majority of those less affluent or economically struggling do not have access to much outdoor space, it is very important to have public parks that are in good physical condition, that are well maintained, inviting and that are respected by users.    In the Community Board 5, Queens area, the Queens portion of Highland Park and Juniper Valley Park are our largest parks. The Ridgewood Reservoir, which is actually located in Glendale, is a beautiful natural oasis within Highland Park.  The reservoir, which is no longer operating to provide drinking water, is more than 50 acres in size, and the closest space to a nature preserve that we have had anytime recently. Brooklyn Community Board 5, where approximately 20% of the Ridgewood Reservoir is located, have been very supportive of this beautiful site becoming the equivalent of a nature preserve.  Community Board 5, Queens has been avidly advocating for the Ridgewood Reservoir to receive Wetlands Status, which was accomplished in  2019. It is important that pedestrians and bicycle riders have safer access to the Ridgewood Reservoir and Highland Park.  Juniper Valley Park, located in Middle Village, is more than 50 acres in size.  This beautiful park contains 7 baseball fields (some of which are also used for softball play), 2 playgrounds, a large soccer field/football field surrounded by a running track, a roller hockey rink, bocce courts, basketball courts, a very active handball courts area, an asphalt softball field and beautiful green space. Juniper Park is utilized by youth and residents of Middle Village and numerous other communities.    Francis J. Principe Park (formerly Maurice Park), Reiff Park and Frontera Park are the city parks primarily serving Maspeth residents. Ridgewood Parks include a portion of Mafera Park, Grover Cleveland Park, Rosemary's Playground, Benninger Park and Starr Playground.  Glendale Parks include a portion of Mafera Park, Evergreen Park, Vito Maranzano's Glendale Playground, Dry Harbor Playground and Pinnocchio Playground.  In addition to Juniper Valley Park, the Middle Village Community also contains Middle Village Playground.      We are very supportive of important capital projects for parks, and realize that parks safety and good parks maintenance are critically important for promoting healthy recreational activity, relaxation and community civility. Maintenance requires adequate personnel, and equipment that is in excellent condition. The following are important needs related to parks maintenance in Community District 5, Queens:  - Having substantially more than 10 maintenance staff, including supervisors for all of the parks in Q5.  - A new Crew Cab is needed (double cabin pick-up truck), with plow attachment and motorized lift gate  - A new Packer (Garbage Truck) is needed, as Q5 is a large district and the existing packer is too often in for repairs and is shared  with Q6 Parks.","The condition of community parks and respect for parks and playgrounds is a vital need in a crowded city, where so many do not have access to outdoor space. In recent years, more parks are being reconstructed or upgraded, but many parks improvements have been capital budget priorities for many years prior to physical improvements beginning. Ongoing park reconstruction and renovation projects are needed to address deteriorated conditions, and to make parks more inviting to good residents. Parks are especially important to the positive development of children and teenagers physically, and, at least as important socially and psychologically. Street tree plantings are needed to reduce air pollution, street heat and greatly beautify city streets and parks properties. Good trees maintenance is vital to prevent dangerous conditions, and to keep trees healthy. Maintenance of N.Y. City Parks should be more of a priority. Maintenance includes personnel and equipment. We need substantially more than 10 Parks Dept. Workers, including supervisors, to care for the many parks in Q5. A new Crew Cab is needed and a new Packer/Garbage Truck is long overdue for parks in District 5, Queens. ","Although in District 5, Queens, we have few cultural facilities other than the historic Onderdonk House on Flushing Avenue, in Ridgewood, the great majority of us realize the importance of quality culture in an age when there are so many negative influences in music, movies and other so called modern culture mediums. Ongoing funding for needed repairs to the Onderdonk House and funding for maintenance of the building and property are an important investment in culture and for historic preservation. ","Local libraries are an excellent source of learning and provide important information on a extensive range of subjects. Every effort should be made to upgrade libraries physically, to market the good that libraries have to offer (especially for children and teens), and to promote learning and research outside of the often standard, sometimes boring school day setting. As a society, we need to make learning much more enticing to young people, since there are too many entertainment distractions. These local libraries, more formally known as branch libraries, are important for providing access to the gift of reading related to many interesting subjects, and are also the scene for many good programs for children, youth and adults. Computers at libraries are well used by many who can not afford to have a computer at home. Having branch libraries open at least 6 days a week is a priority. There are 4 branch libraries located within the boundaries of Community District 5, Queens. The Ridgewood Library is located on Forest Avenue at Madison Street. The Maspeth Library is located on Grand Avenue, along the main shopping strip. The Middle Village Library is located on Metropolitan Avenue, just west of the main shopping strip. The historic Glendale Library, which was funded for extensive capital renovations that have finally been completed, is located on 73 Place at Myrtle Avenue. Community Board 5, Queens has a long history of successfully advocating for library improvements. ","Staff members at Community Boards, with the possible exception of District Managers, are often struggling economically. Many of them have worked diligently for more than a decade toward the stabilization of communities throughout NY City. I would like to see community boards receive a budget increase to give well deserved merit increases to deserving Board staff, many of who earn less than $50,000. for full time work and then some. Regular funding increases are needed to enable Community Board to purchase newer computers, photocopiers, printers, and supplies.

Community Board 6 is an active and welcoming community with a dynamic history, an abundance of greenery, and distinctive landscaping. There is a small town feeling throughout the area, which includes street fairs, jazz concerts, cultural events, and a Green Market on weekends. However, the quality of life issues of the district have changed. The swift increase in population has taxed the capacity of some public facilities.  This coupled with increased frequency and severity of storms has pushed our public facilities beyond their limits resulting in never before seen flooding.  The schools are overcrowded, the subway is jammed during rush hours, and land use matters are becoming a major concern in Community Board 6. In spite of some problems the district provides a good living environment and prosperous commercial enterprises. However, both population and commercial growth have strained many components of the district's physical and social infrastructure...we have most certainly changed. Community Board 6 requests the following: 1. Adequate staffing in the 112th Precinct. 2. Protect our established low density residential areas from over building. 3. Discourage intensive and or inappropriate commercial development. 4. Maintain and improve municipal services and infrastructure with regard to sewers and flooding issues in the district. 5.

They include but are not limited to:  1. Improved and timely transportation pertaining to the Access-A-Ride system.  2. Delivery of meals  3. Counseling services - including for the homebound  4. Appropriate housing support  5. Hospice services  6. Increased home care services  7. Recreation activities - including library services for homebound  8. Translation services  9. Appropriate Medication support and Management  10. Respite care for caregivers  11. Bereavement services for family  12. The services offered through ThriveNYC  CB 6 encourages funding for research leading to an end to all life threatening diseases, particularly AIDS, Alzheimer's ; Cancer, and Diabetes. CB 6 supports any program to educate with the aim of eliminating domestic violence. We also support any services which provide assistance to victims of domestic violence ","CB 6 has one of the highest concentrations of senior population in NYC. There continues to be a large influx of immigrants of all ages. The confluence of these two with the usual problems of the general population creates needs such as:  1. Affordable health care, including dental and eye care  2. Affordable housing  3. Public safety and security  4. Accessible transportation - both physically and affordable  5. Daycare services for homebound and elderly.  6. Affordable mental health services-also to be available to homebound  7. Affordable legal services  8. Recreation including library services for homebound  Our community consists of a significant number of older adults, many of which are living their lives largely independent of family members who live far away. They turn to their neighborhood based senior services for assistance. The social adult day program aims to keep at risk elderly in the community and avoid premature institutionalization by providing them with an opportunity to socialize with peers and create a network of support to rely upon. The educational, recreational programs aim to stimulate their minds and bodies and enhance their self esteem. For the families of the dementia population, social adult day care provides a respite for the family members, and more are needed. These programs have long waiting lists and are underfunded. There is increased demand for services for persons with early dementia as there are waiting lists for the programs for persons who suffer from middle and late stage dementia. A population at risk is the large diverse immigrant elderly population, many of whom have not yet been able to acquire the language skills needed to obtain citizenship and have lost their benefits that are needed for everyday subsistence, including the ability to pay for shelter and food. As such, there is a tremendous increase in the need for ESL classes, conversation groups, tutorials, civics instruction and case assistance. Also, the cultural and language barriers have created increased tensions in the community that are being addressed by the Queens Community House through dialogue groups and the 112th Precinct. These programs are funded through government dollars. The demand for services is huge and the waitlist, long and discouraging. ","CB 6 supports funding for homeless services, including housing and social services support for the unhoused. ","Community Board 6 supports an increase in ""in home services"" for individuals that are low income, yet do not qualify for Medicaid.  These programs should be expanded to allow more seniors to have valuable cost saving services.   ","","","","","After school programs","","Beacon programs are highly effective programs that offer positive youth development through educational, cultural and literacy programs.  Currently we have Beacon sites that serve the needs of many of our communities youth.    Preventative programs are necessary to keep young people active and engaged in constructive programs.  These programs should include educational and career choice counseling.  All while impacting high school drop out prevention.    Youth employment programs should be expanded to address youth employment, develop jobs, and job training programs.    In order to make certain that we are doing the best for our youth, the Dept. of Youth and Community Development, must engage in cooperative planning, ensure the most effective use of current youth programs, as well as the development of additional programs in Community Board 6.","Community Board 6 enjoys working closely with District 28 as well as all the public, private, and parochial schools. More importantly, the lines of communication between the board and the schools should be more transparent.  As our communities continue grow, a majority of our public schools are beyond or near capacity. An investment in additional seats across nearly all schools is necessary to meet the demands of our burgeoning population.  We are also concerned that our public schools in our district are not 100% ADA accessible. This creates an unfair inequity that urgently needs addressed.    ","Affordable Day Care for Children - There has been a substantial increase in the number of two parent families in which both parents are working and also there are a growing number of single parent families who are in our community. As a result, there is a serious need for affordable daycare with continued expansion of Pre-K and 3K for all.  We need to ensure that the inventory of available 3k and Pre-K seats match the demand in our communities.  It is also crucial that these seats be evenly distributed throughout our neighborhoods. ","","","","","Police-community relations","","Community policing is the first step toward community safety and repairing relationships.  We must build back neighborhood partnerships while securing the safety and fair treatment of civilians and the police that risk their lives every day.","More than 95 percent of CB 6, traditionally a safe, low crime area, is served by the 112th Precinct which has one of the smallest patrol forces in the City. For this reason, the 112th Precinct should not be pulled to assist with events in Flushing Meadow Park, Citifield, and the U.S. Open.  The principal public safety need in this Community District is for real increases in the size of our patrol force, for these reasons:  1. A significant rise in population, the influx of new immigrants and a substantial increase in ethnic/racial diversity have made policing in CB 6 more complex and time-consuming  2. Other demographic changes, particularly a great increase in youth population, add burdens to the precinct's workload  3. The district's relative affluence continues to attract burglars, bank robbers and shoplifters  4. The 112 Pct. must also provide police services for many tens of thousands of non-residents who enter our District daily - either to transfer (and often shop) at our three intermodal transit hubs along Queens Blvd. (at Union Turnpike, 71 Avenue, and 63 Road) or to visit the upscale retail/entertainment area along Forest Hills' Austin Street - or to access the Rego Park regional shopping center.  5. Traffic safety remains an urgent focus of community concern, in view of the long history of pedestrian fatalities on Queens Blvd.   Contributing factors that need enforcement are: Increasing use of e-bikes and illegal scooters and an increasing number of motorists ignore the prohibition against use of hand-held cell phones while driving. Enforcement of these laws, while difficult, is essential; In addition, greater emphasis should be placed on the guidelines of vision zero.  6. Quality of Life complaints (some not within NYPD's purview) continue to be numerous in CB 6.  7. The urgent new counter-terrorism mission for NYPD, which requires extensive training time, assignment of officers to additional posts/duties within the precinct, and their detail for special situations elsewhere in the City, logically will affect performance in a small precinct more seriously than a larger one.  8. Increase police enforcement near schools, particularly the Metropolitan Avenue schools, and at all NYCHA Housing.  9. Support for CB 6's Community Emergency Response Team. (CERT) and a continued focus on the 112th Precinct Explorer's Program.  10. Recruiting and retaining school crossing guards should be a major priority in CB 6. ","As is well known, CB 6 is densely developed with high-rise and mid-rise multi-family structures, including several of the tallest residential buildings in Queens.  CB6 has one engine and one ladder company in a single firehouse within its boundaries, and another on its border.  FDNY deployments to structural fires within the district have customarily been satisfactorily prompt.  Increased routine or complaint follow-up inspections by FDNY are viewed as essential fire protection actions by this community.  All demolition and construction projects, particularly those undertaken by small contractors, in our densely developed district evoke neighborhood concerns and merit FDNY and DOB oversight.    Housing market demand has led to numerous illegal conversions of one and two family homes to multi- family or SRO’s.  We believe that participation by DOB, FDNY, and its Fire Prevention Bureau, to the fullest extent possible under existing laws, in the campaign to halt and reverse/remediate illegal conversions, would serve this community well.","","","","","Cleanliness/trash collection","","The current economic climate has given rise to growing quality of life problems such as graffiti.  Graffiti continues to be a problem that has come back on both public and private property throughout CB 6.   We should encourage the private sector to provide funding to help keep our neighborhoods clean.  Additional mechanical brooms are needed to keep our streets clean.","2021 saw two back to back storms that brought unprecedented flooding in our district.  The current pace of maintenance is no match for the storms we are facing.  An overhaul of the sewage system would be ideal, but that takes time and federal resources.  In the meantime, we need maintenance schedules accelerated and increased assessments.  As severe storms approach we need increased catch basin cleanings throughout the district.  Lastly, adding rain gardens to our flood prone areas (Grand Central Parkway corridor, Kessel Street, Selfridge Street and the area around Park City) would aid in mitigating the flood risk to those areas.    ","Sanitation services continue to be a priority in both the residential and commercial areas of Community Board 6.  In order to properly maintain the cleanliness level of CB6, we require:  1. Additional funding for litter basket pickups on commercial strips and a litter basket truck.  2. Fund regularly scheduled cleanup of medians.  3. Maintain weekly recycling and composting.  4. Hire more Sanitation Enforcement agents.  5. Increase enforcement of dirty sidewalks and streets  6. Mechanical broom for the fall leaf season, a 10 yard alley truck, and a graffiti power washer ","","","","","Commercial district revitalization","","There is a major need for programs to assist the commercial strips on Community Board 6 to improve business and cope with growing problems of vacancies; Long term businesses are being forced out because of substantial rent increases.  Commercial rents need to be dealt with on a citywide basis.  Support from Government would assist the commercial districts in making progress.","Community Board 6 recognizes the following needs:  Department of City Planning:   All large scale developments, whether commercial or residential, need to be studied to ensure that the local electrical grid, gas supply, water supply, sewerage, garbage disposal, transportation systems, schools, parks, recreational facilities, and other utilities and facilities have sufficient capacity for the additional demand that will be created by the developments. Much of CB6 development is as-of-right, which means the developers don't present to the CB and the process excludes environmental review or mandatory inclusionary housing. It is necessary to study the current and future as-of-right developments in CB6 in relation to these two categories.  Department of Buildings:  1. Hire additional inspectors for timely response to complaints.  2. Substantially increase penalties for violations so that they are meaningful.  3. Verify that payment for violations clear a bank before removing the violation. ","CB 6 supports funding for affordable and senior housing as well as supportive housing. ","There is a need for programs to assist the commercial strips in Forest Hills and Rego Park to improve business and cope with the growing problem of vacancies. There is a need to help small businesses in our community and elsewhere in the city. We support the small business first initiative to help small business owners, in particular the restaurants. ","","","","","Traffic congestion","","In terms of traffic / traffic flow, adequacy, pedestrian and vehicular safety and resource allocation, transportation concerns impact Community Board 6 in a variety of significant ways that require priority attention.  Future projects like the ""Queens Boulevard Capital Project"" will go a long way to alleviate some of our most congested areas.   ","Queens Boulevard - This major artery provides vital transportation access for the entire borough, but causes significant and chronic safety problems for both pedestrians and vehicles. To address these concerns, CB 6 approved a comprehensive plan by DOT to improve vehicular traffic, pedestrian and bike rider safety on Queens Boulevard in the western portion of our district.  As the plan has been implemented in both western and eastern portion of Queens Boulevard, we need to ensure that the temporary flexiposts are replaced with 15 foot jersey barriers throughout.  Woodhaven Boulevard - It is especially important to balance the legitimate needs of streamlining traffic flow with the vital safety concerns of the pedestrians and bicycle riders who access Woodhaven Boulevard. Attention must be given to the enhancement of ""green-light time"" for those seeking to cross the boulevard; traffic markings that coincide with actual vehicular and pedestrian traffic flow; clearly delineated and properly ""lined up"" crosswalks that are sensitive to the needs of the disabled; and safe and appropriate bicycle lanes. In addition, the impact of Woodhaven's traffic flow upon adjacent local streets and the adoption of possible mitigating measures should also be included within the scope of this project. Lanes of traffic have been removed from Woodhaven Boulevard for general traffic and have become dedicated bus lanes. This has markedly increased traffic congestion on Woodhaven Blvd, especially in the vicinity of Woodhaven Blvd & Union Turnpike.  However, bus speeds have improved on this corridor.   Union Turnpike - This heavily utilized thoroughfare generates significant traffic safety concerns that require DOT's ongoing priority attention. Specifically, aggressive enforcement plus the installation of traffic barriers are needed to deter the speeding and reckless driving problems. Pedestrian crosswalks need to be prominently highlighted and traffic signal ""green-light time"" increased at the local intersections to promote pedestrian safety. This particularly applies to the 71st Ave intersection, which provides primary pedestrian access to a heavily utilized playground as well as the Stop & Shop Supermarket. DOT and Parks Dept must ensure the proper lighting and maintenance of all pedestrian sidewalk and railroad bridge approaches leading to the Stop and Shop area.  Yellowstone Boulevard - Yellowstone Boulevard generates significant traffic volumes that traverse a frequently winding road and several complex street crossings involving multiple major thoroughfares. The intersections at Queens Blvd, Austin St, Selfridge St & Woodhaven Blvd present significant traffic circulation and pedestrian access issues that need to be addressed systematically. Improved signage and highlighted crosswalks are needed in those areas where the street turns diminish pedestrian visibility. ","Forest Hills is a major transportation hub for New York City. Thousands of commuters pass through these two destinations on their way to or from other destinations. Several bus lines originate here, four subway lines stop here, and one LIRR station is here, creating significant impacts for Community Board 6. Given this intensity of ridership and intermodal usage, Queens Community Board 6 requires continual maintenance and investment in its transit infrastructure. The MTA is habitually short of critical capital funds needed to maintain and grow the system. Bus service, that runs parallel to subway service, when subway construction and repairs take place on weekends and in evening hours, should be increased. For example, when either the E, F, M or R are taken out of service on weekends and in the overnight hours for scheduled work, the Q60 should have increased service.  Indeed as development continues and the need to provide residents with alternatives to car use grows, bus service along our major thoroughfares, in particular 108th Street, Queens Boulevard and Woodhaven Boulevard needs to be increased generally.  We therefore call on the City to provide a meaningful subsidy to the MTA, contingent upon the MTA living up to reasonable performance standards. These subsidies should assist in: Funding E/F skip stop service, with some trains originating in Forest Hills. Enhancing frequency and speed of express bus service. Improved subway station maintenance, cleanliness, improved lighting, updated platforms and mezzanines at 71st Ave. station The creation of better bus shelters for the thousands of commuters who wait for buses in all weather. There is a growing need for a reduced fare city ticket for the LIRR that is not merely limited to weekend commutes.   ","","","","","Library facilities and access","","Full library services, year round with expanded programs for pre-school and after school needs of children.  Our libraries are over crowded and have placed limitations on library services.    We need larger facilities due to growing numbers of immigrants using them as an educational tool, such as the Rego Park Branch.  CB 6 feels that all libraries should be ADA Accessible.","Outreach through the Parks Dept. should be made to local business, Civic organizations and schools to ""adopt"" a Park or Vest Pocket to assist with planting, landscaping, clean up and also in monetary contributions.  Forestry: Pruning of all trees within CB 6, both in Parks and in residential areas as well as removal of all dead or infected trees and stumps/roots as part of regularly scheduled maintenance. Additionally, replanting or new planting of shade trees within all Park areas.  Parks, Playgrounds & Recreation: CB6 requests CONTINUED AND INCREASED MAINTENANCE of all playground equipment including safety matting and also additional ""sprinkler"" apparatus for children. All local parks, vest pocket park areas, dog runs and playgrounds should be cleaned and maintained on a regular schedule and enhanced to provide maximum usage.  Lost Battalion Hall is an essential part of the community and we support upgrading and improvement in all respects.  Flushing Meadow & Willow Lake Park areas should be made available to residents along the south side of the Park area and enhanced with benches and access routes.  Whenever open land becomes available in high density areas, Parks Dept. should secure the property to provide a green space for residents.  However, if additional parks are added to the district, staff should be added to accomodate.  Green Infrastructure: With an increasing number of rain gardens being installed throughout our community, we are requesting regular maintenance and cleaning of these structures. ","Cultural events within our community provide life enrichment, bring a diverse community together, and attract tourist dollars. CB6 requests adequate funding for the Department of Cultural Affairs Expense Budget to enable local arts programs; for cultural and arts programs within CB6 serving Queens as a whole (including Veterans groups - Memorial Day Parade, etc and the Chamber of Commerce - Jazz Thursday); and for performances, workshops, and other cultural opportunities.","The libraries in Community Board 6 are heavily utilized by growing numbers of immigrants. It is essential that the libraries remain accessible to all people as an educational tool. Expansion of the Rego Park Library is a major priority of CB 6, along with weekend service to be permanently put in the budget.  All libraries must be made ADA Accessible .

It is comprised of eight towns, Bay Terrace, Beechhurst, College Point, most of Flushing, Malba, Queensborough Hill, Whitestone, and, Willets Point, making up 12.7 square miles and 285 miles of city streets. We are an extremely diverse community consisting of one and two family homes, suburban/urban high rise apartments, 64 park locations, 30 greenstreets, an intermodal transportation hub with 26 bus lines, the #7 train, and the L.I.R.R. In addition, we are the 4th busiest retail area in the city, the second largest industrial area in the borough because of the College Point Corporate Park, and, the 2nd busiest downtown behind Herald Square. Our board has the largest waterfront area running from Flushing Bay to Fort Totten. Our diversity presents us with many challenges and problems, which we must address and resolve, if we are to maintain the level of our past accomplishments, and improve our quality of life in the 21st century. These can be summarized along the following issues: zoning, parking, the environment, transportation, traffic, service delivery, waterfront development, in addition to maintaining the economic growth in downtown Flushing, College Point, Bay Terrace and Whitestone. We are concerned about meeting the needs of our senior citizens, the proliferation of houses of worship, maintaining the viability of our parks, as well as our historic heritage. Our most immediate emphasis is concentrating on managing new developments within our board area, and the potential of its impact on traffic, service delivery, and schools for our youngsters. Evidence shows that our board has experienced enormous building growth in both commercial and residential areas. For example within only a four block radius of downtown Flushing, the housing stock in the past 25 years has grown, and projects presently on the drawing board will bring in additional units of housing within the next several years. Flushing Commons is doing a mixed use development on the old Municipal Parking lot #1, the Hyatt Place hotel opened on Prince Street as part of the Fulton 1 mixed use development, and the anticipated Fulton 11, also a mixed used ""as of right"" development, is on the drawing board directly across the street on 39th Avenue between Prince Street and College Point Boulevard. With the completion of the 2010 census, our population was estimated to be approximately 256,000 documented persons, making us the largest population wise of all 59 boards. Many census tracts in and around downtown Flushing have experienced substantial population growth. This data confirms that the trend of substantial growth in our area has continued adding to the demand for new market rate and affordable housing, senior housing, classroom space, and city services. ","","","","","Street conditions (roadway maintenance)","","Federal, State and City funding is insufficient to meet the needs of our capital projects, which are necessary to provide desperately needed infrastructure improvements.  The majority of our capital priorities has been and will remain, transportation requests. Capital construction needs to be accelerated to accommodate the increased volume of traffic, and deteriorated condition of our streets.  We need to see Linden Place phase 2, connecting to 20th Avenue accelerated since this street will be needed for the reconstruction of Ulmer Street between the Whitestone Expressway Service road and 25th Avenue, as well as 28th Avenue between College Point Boulevard and Linden Place.  Both Ulmer Street and 28th Avenue will have to be closed for several years because of the necessity to do surcharging.   The city recently resurfaced 20th Avenue, however, with its heavy utilization by cars, buses, and trucks - many of which are 18 wheelers, the roadbed will not be able to be sustained, and will eventually begin collapsing.  The agency took a Band-Aid approach to a hemorrhage.    The condition of our streets are terrible,, with a  myriad of potholes and ruts it is difficult to navigate resulting in many drivers have sustained damage to their cars.    The agency needs to accelerate some of its basic maintenance issues, such as repainting of street markers indicating ""Stop Ahead"", ""Speed Bumps"", school crossing signs, and re-installation of street name and stop ahead signs.  These delays generate many community complaints.","Street flooding","","The agency must seriously look at accelerating our number one capital budget request for the reconstruction of 20th Avenue from the Whitestone Expressway service road to College Point Boulevard, as well as 127th Street between 14th and 22nd Avenues.  This major roadway connects the communities of Whitestone to College Point.  The roadbed which is heavily utilized is uneven, has many ruts, as well as a serious drainage problem.  ","Traffic","","The commercial areas of Flushing, College Point, and Whitestone generate a tremendous amount of car, bus and truck traffic.  This puts an incredible strain on the streets and highways of these communities.   ","","","","","Programs, services or facilities for seniors (incl. remote programming, cooling centers)","","Community Board #7 being the largest population wise, have approximately 110,000 seniors living in our district.  We have seen a younger, more vibrant senior whom want innovative and exciting programs.  We are happy to see that the Department for the Aging has created more innovative centers.  They have expanded the hours, their programs are more diverse, and have expanded  programming by introducing technology, cultural arts, weekends, and addressing the needs of our multi-cultural community.  They have realized that by keeping their minds active, they remain younger.  In addition DFTA has seen the need to introduce Virtual Senior Centers programs, and has also implemented  a tele-health kiosk to measure and track health outcomes for their members on an ongoing basis.","No comments","Our concern is that 1/3 of our population are seniors, and growing.  There is a need for additional services for better access to ""Access A Ride"" or perhaps a voucher program for transportation as ""Access A Ride"" has a poor track record. and, centers that would accommodate the active to frail senior with programs to meet their needs, as well as affordable housing.      In additional with regard to the frail senior, these centers must actively pursue the idea of an ongoing intergenerational program connecting seniors with high school and college students who can either be companions, or assist them with simple chores.","No comments","No comments","","","","","Youth workforce development and summer youth employment","","Beacon programs are effective programs that offer positive youth development through educational, cultural and literacy programs.  Currently we have two Beacon sites that serve the needs of approximately 47,000 youth.    Preventative programs are necessary to keep youngsters active and engaged in constructive programs , and should include educational and career choice counseling,  as well as high school drop out prevention.    Youth employment programs should be expanded to address youth employment, develop jobs, and job training programs.    In order to make certain that we are doing the best for our youth, the Dept. of Youth and Community Development, must engage in cooperative planning, ensure the most effective use of current youth programs, as well as the development of additional pro","Construction of a middle school for College Point is essential.  With the increase in population, and the only middle school that closed decades ago, these children need to travel to the communities of either Flushing or Whitestone.    In additional anytime the board votes on a large scale development, one of the criteria for approval is that the developer must look at placing a school within the site to accommodate the children in the area.      In downtown Flushing, due the school over-crowding, P.S. 107, which is located at 167-02 45th Avenue, for the next two years will be accepting the kindergarten children from P.S. 24, which is located at 141-11 Holly Avenue.","No comments","","","","","Emergency service delivery (including rapid response)","","With both Police and Fire, our residents are concerned with the effect of quality of life issues.  Due to the increased urbanization, and new high rise development, which is increasing the population, resulting in a heavier workload with our Public Safety agencies.    The present geographical boundary, and the influx of new Americans within our district has been burdened with the demand to service the community properly.     The ability to maneuver through the district with an emergency vehicle becomes a challenge. Thus delaying the response time to either a fire or police incident.","Recently due to the needs of this community, the local precinct (109th) has received an additional 60 officers, and, within the next several months, an additional 30 officers will be assigned to the precinct.      In addition, we are now involved in a program which allows for a total of 6 NCO's .  The district is broken up into four sectors that are covered by two NCO's , and our NYCHA housing projects are covered by two additional NCO teams.  This is in addition to the usual police coverage.    The residents living in these specific areas, if they request, are given the cell phone numbers of the NCO's covering their specific area.  it is a program that allows for almost instant police coverage/communication in that specific area.  It is a hands on program that the residents of our district are very happy to have received.","As there has been an increase within the Asian community, our community desperately needs more Korean and Chinese personnel.  Our board has over 800 establishments selling alcohol, karaoke bars, internet cafes to name a few.  Several buildings within our district have these types of establishments under one roof.  This does create a problem for emergency services, since the information that we are able to obtain from the Dept. of Buildings, may indicate several serious issues/violations which SLA pays no attention.  Doors can be blocked, they have not built according to plans,  no emergency lighting, sprinklers or secondary means of egress.  In case of a real emergency the lives of the patron as well as the service provider will be in jeopardy.  All agencies must be on the same page.  SLA must listen to the Community Board as well as both fire and police departments as it pertains to the laws on the books.","","","","","Cleanliness/trash collection","","While they are all important, it is very difficult to just narrow it down.  Our residents are constantly calling our office with regard to dump outs, improper garbage disposal, and persons going through the trash looking for bottles/cans for recycling.    Because of the importance of this issue, the formation of a BID was established in the downtown Flushing area to help alleviate the debri left on the sidewalks, the overflowing baskets, as well as the greasy sidewalks.  In addition the Councilperson in Whitestone has funded a twice a weekly BID operation to make sure that the Village is kept clean.  With regard to Whitestone, we are working with the Dept. of Transportation to change the parking regulations in order to assist.","Since 1984 our board has included in their capital and expense budget submissions the need to construct both sanitary and storm water systems within the district.  We have seen a major increase due to the aging sewer systems which have resulted in major flooding problems especially in the areas of north Flushing, College Point as well as Whitestone.      One of our major projects is SE809 which goes from along the N/B Whitestone Expressway Service Road from College Point Boulevard to 25th Road, and Union Street on the eastern portion.  It entailed water mains, sanitary sewers, a storm system and chambers, and later this year we will see the start of SE807 which will cover the western portion of College Point, and, followed by SE810/811 which will be east of SE809.  All of these projects have always received special attention when doing our budget due to the severity of the flooding that occurs, impacting not only homes, but, major roadbeds.","Litter, especially in the downtown shopping areas, is a never ending problem even with the Flushing BID in place.  Multi-language educational efforts are required to explain the various sanitation laws in the District's citizens and businesses.  Enforcement is needed, but it must be fair and reasonable.  We request that emphasis be placed on ticketing the litterbugs instead of where their litter falls.  This will reduce litter now, and in the future as this will also be an educational effort for those ticketed.    Community Board #7 supports the various recycling programs, and the outreach and educational efforts must continue, and be increased to encourage vigorous participation by all citizens and businesses.  Weekly recycling must continue, and we are happy to see new materials targeted for recycling, such as textiles and food wastes.  Multi language educational efforts must target those areas with lower capture and diversion rates.    The towing of cars from snow emergency streets during snowstorms must initiated to allow for better snow removal.  Snow removal efforts have improved since the agency added the trucking of snow out of the congested areas, and where possible, the melting of snow to reduce the mounds of plowed snow.    With the recent opening of the North Shore Marine transfer station, efforts must be in place to ensure that sanitation drivers from other community districts use only the approved truck routes coming and going from the MTS.  Local streets are not through streets, and should not be used.","","","","","Building code and/or zoning enforcement","","To facilitate the demands of the District, the Building/Housing Committee is recommending Building Code Enforcement as a priority since it will protect homeowners, coop/condo owners and renters alike. To further support the request for Building Code Enforcement, the borough of Queens receives more requests for code enforcement than any other borough.","Our board has been working with the elected officials as well as City Planning on the development of Flushing West which goes from Roosevelt Avenue to Northern Boulevard from Prince Street to the water.  We have had quite a few meetings with all affected parties, however, just recently City Planning, at the request of our Councilman have put the brakes on this project.  We are concerned with regard to the need of an additional CSO tank which presently is not on the drawing board.  What DEP wants to do is chlorinate the water, which is environmentally not safe for marine life.  In addition, developers are having major problems with MIH due to the fact that the banks will not give them financing.      Three major development projects are moving along - Sky Vu park; Fulton II and Flushing Commons is nearing completion of Phase I.  All of these developments will be putting a major burden on city services.  Downtown Flushing is presently congested, the #7 train platforms are overcrowded and unsafe, in addition to other city services.    While development is good for any neighborhood, we have found that the Environmental Impact Statements do not correctly detail the needs for the development, and/or the community.  Any new large scale development does have an impact on city services, that must be addressed.","No comments","In working with the Flushing BID and Chamber, we have been having meetings regarding the 360 Grant for the Downtown Flushing Commercial District Needs Assessment.  What the agency really needs to address is the hiring of a bilingual person who is knowledgeable in city rules and regulations, and, must be a liaison between businesses and city agencies.  This person needs to be able to interface with the Community Board, BID and Chamber.  The city needs to make this investment in order for the business community to survive.  Rather than violate, they must educate.  This investment will maintain the present business growth in Flushing.    Our existing Flushing BID has been a very effective and positive influence for our bustling commercial strip...they have worked on graffiti removal programs, sanitation issues, security cameras, a restaurant guide, hanging banners as well as flower baskets.  The Executive Director along with his board, are always coming up with new ideas to help improve the commercial atmosphere in the area.  Presently the BID is awaiting approval for its expansion.","","","","","Accessibility (ADA related compliance and infrastructure enhancements)","","While we are only given the opportunity to select one, each of the above plays a very important role as to how our residents feel about the flow of traffic, accessibility to mass transit, the ability to safely navigate a congested sidewalk.    In addition, their is a lack of properly maintaining our roadways and the maintenance of our bridges.    Many of our complaints coming from our residents deal with the condition of the sidewalks, curbs, pedestrian pads as well as the many deteriorated bus pads.  Each of these creates a major tripping problem, especially for seniors and the handicapped.    Sidewalks and curbs seem to be an issue with Contractors not doing a good job and residence complaining.","We are constantly receiving complaints from residents living in our district about the #7 train line.  The station is filthy, the escalators are constantly in repair, the staircases are extremely narrow, the platforms during rush hour are jammed, and with the increase in population, we are concerned that this station will not be able to handle the crowds that will be utilizing this station.    In addition, the L.I.R.R. is a nightmare in downtown Flushing.  The staircases, are extremely steep and even able bodied individuals have a difficult time navigating these staircases onto the platform.  The construction of the elevator must be accelerated.","With the increased populations, and approximately 100,000 persons passing through downtown Flushing every day, we have requested that the #7 line platform be expanded west of Main Street, and that the subway line be extended east to the other neighborhoods of Flushing and Bayside. Thus relieving some of the congestion in the downtown area.     We are an intra-modal transportation hub with 24 bus lines converging in downtown Flushing area. MTA has introduced SBS which is having a tremendous negative impact in downtown Flushing. This is having a negative impact on the small business community, making it more difficult to receive deliveries, and parking close to the stores has become more difficult to find.  Downtown Flushing is the 2nd most congested area in the city, and by introducing the SBS, they have narrowed down Main Street to one lane in each direction. This has resulted in traffic at times coming to a crawl due to the lack of street capacity.    In addition, the LIRR station at Willets Point must be in operation on a yearly basis.  The only time that this station operates is for the Mets home games, as well as the USTA.  If it were to operate full time, then drivers could utilize the abutting parking fields, thus relieving some of the congestion in downtown Flushing.","","","","","Street tree and forestry services (including street tree maintenance)","","Community Board #7 has 64 park locations, over 30 greenstreets, as well as a portion of Flushing Meadows Corona Park.  Our residents are always concerned about the maintenance and care of their parks, as well as the care of the trees within each of these parks.  Unfortunately the maintenance of the trees within Kissena Park resulted in the death of a pregnant woman.    Our residents are always calling us to discuss the conditions of the equipment that their children use within the playgrounds, and many of our seniors call with regard to the tennis courts.    Due to the fact that we have a lot of park properties, the leagues are always concerned about the maintenance of the ballfields, soccer and football fields.","In each of our parks, where there is a parkhouse, the residents are always requesting that the park have a full time park person over seeing the cleanliness of the building, as well as the balance of the park.    As part of our budget we have always supported the needed for supplies that are for the park funded daycare programs.    Within our expense budget priorities we have always supported an increase in regular as well as seasonal personnel in order to handle the ongoing maintenance of our tennis courts, proper tree maintenance, pruning and removals,     We have quite a few Joint operated parks that need constant maintenance since they abut the local schools, and unfortunately the custodians of the schools do not assist. The JOP's must be maintained by both the parks and the Department of Education.     With the tremendous amount of parkland, our district has a full time gardener and two part time gardeners to deal with the upkeep of the grass and flower beds within each of our parks.    The sidewalk tree program time must be accelerated.  Residents do not want to wait several years to have the roots trimmed on a city sidewalk tree that is uplifting their sidewalks causing tripping hazards and a liability to the homeowner.    Since we have a tremendous amount of parkland, many of our capital and expense budget submission are for the parks department either through upgrading of a specific park, or additional resources for the agency.","Flushing being the home of religious freedom, we house a myriad of cultural institutions that play a vital part for our communities.  We have Flushing Council on Culture and the Arts housed in Flushing Town Hall, Queens Botanical Gardens, Poppenhusen Institute, Kingsland House, the Louis Latimer House, and  Volker Orth House.  Each of these buildings have played a very important role in the history of Queens, and we must constantly support their survival    These facilities provide music, art, and historical programs that our communities have requested, and they depend on financial help in order to address these requests.  During a difficult budget year, their much needed funding has always been cut.  Unfortunately these cuts result in an increase in monies that the patrons have to allocate.    These institutions even though they are housed in our community, they serve the borough with programs of interest for all age groups, as well as ethnic populations.","No comments","Community Board #7 is the largest population wise of all 59 community boards, in addition to being the most diverse world wide. In some instances our board serves over 150,000 more people  than some Community Boards within the city. Even though we are a city agency, and we do appreciate the city picking up the cost of our rent, we still must pay for various service contracts in order for our agency to operate on a daily basis.    In addition, the work load is tremendous due to the increase in population, development within the community - large scale developments - shopping malls and commercials establishments, we are working with 3 1/2 people including the District Manager.      With a recorded population of over 250,000 documented people, and perhaps over 300,00 with the undocumented, of which 1/3 are seniors, and 1/3 new Americans, many of which many do not have a  command of the English language.  This all takes more time, and while all boards receive the same budget, we feel this has a tremendous impact on our dedicated staff that works extremely hard to make sure that the needs of our residents are met.","","","","","Explanation","","","","","","","","","","QN7","","","","","","","","","","",""

It includes the communities of Briarwood, Flushing Suburban, Flushing Heights, Fresh Meadows, Hillcrest, Hillcrest Estates, Holliswood, Jamaica Estates, Jamaica Hills, Kew Gardens Hills, Utopia and West Cunningham Park. It also includes parts of Hollis and Queens Village (north of Hillside Avenue). These communities are overwhelmingly residential with several commercial strips. There were over 160,000 residents counted during the 2020 Census who reside in Community District 8. There has been a moderate but steady increase in population. Our residents are mostly middle income, multi-ethnic, multi-racial individuals who own their own homes, condos and co-ops or are renters. The residences consist of one and two-family homes, garden apartments, large apartment buildings such as the Fresh Meadows Development, co-ops such as Electchester, Hilltop Village and Parkway Village. Our district also houses the New York City Housing Authority complex - Pomonok. It is important to understand that our population, as counted by the census, does not accurately represent the need for services in our district. Queens College, CUNY Law School, St. John's University and Lander College for Men are located within our borders. Thousands of students who are not counted by the US Census reside in our community while attending college/university from the months of August through May. Hillside Avenue is also a major transporation hub. Thousands of residents come from eastern Queens and Long Island to board the E and F train to Manhattan. The services that we receive should reflect the needs of these individuals along with those of our permanent residents. Community Board 8 residents are concerned with quality of life issues, upgrading the infrastructure, personal safety and security, education and maintaining their fair share of City services. TRANSPORTATION - Many of our roads are in poor condition. We continue to request an increase in asphalt allocation for street resurfacing. Some of our roads are sinking and need to be reconstructed. To this end, we are asking for increased funding for trench restoration. We request stand-alone funding for curb installation and replacement. There is a backlog of necessary curb repair and curb installation for over a decade. Currently, DOT replaces curbs only when the adjoining sidewalk is repaired. Homeowners choose to wait for DOT contractors to do the work instead of repairing their own sidewalks within 45 days of receiving the notice of violation. This is the only way to ensure that DOT replaces broken curbing. As a result, sidewalks remain damaged for a longer period of time and the danger to pedestrians is also prolonged. In addition, this will cost the City additional funds in case of lawsuits due to negligence. BUILDINGS - Much of Community Board 8's housing stock is residential with many one-family and two-family dwellings. Additional Buildings Department inspectors are necessary to enforce existing regulations and address quality of life violations. DOB introduced the Development Challenge Process initiative a many years ago. Additional plan examiners are needed to review and respond to these challenges and the many requests that we receive for audits. More plan examiners would eliminate the self-certification by architects and engineers. We receive our share of illegal conversion and illegal occupancy complaints. The lack of affordable, regulated housing is the root cause of the prevalence of illegal apartments. There are very few rent stabilized apartments within Community District 8. SANITATION - Although Community Board 8 has relatively clean streets, we have issues that need attention. With the steady increase in population, our superintendent must receive the support necessary to address our sanitation issues: • The paved center malls require year-round cleaning and more frequent seasonal weed-control. • Retain the five day-a-week pick-ups at public schools and extra pick-ups at the Pomonok Houses. • Sanitation Police are needed for night patrol to discourage illegal dumping especially on abandoned properties and entrances to and exits to Grand Central Parkway, Clearview Exppressway, Long Island Expressway and Van Wyck Expressway. • Additional agents for Sanitation Code Enforcement are needed to address the quality of life complaints that we receive. While the enforcement issues for residential properties are addressed, we noticed that enforcement of our commercial strips is insufficient (i.e. Hillside Avenue and Main Street). While we do not want to stifle business by fining our small business owners, some of them are repeat offenders who show a total disregard for the community. The issuance of a violation is the only way to receive cooperation. • Community Board 8 continues to support dedicated baskets for our commercial areas. We must be provided with seven-day service to ensure the cleanliness of our commercial strips. The Adopt-a-Basket program must be better promoted to encourage public and private sector partnerships. This should be promoted through public service announcements on television and radio. SENIORS/YOUTH/EDUCATION/LIBRARIES - A civilization is best judged by the way it treats its most vulnerable members (seniors and youth). There has been a marked increase in the youth population in CB8 and such an increase demands additional services. Increased funding for aftershool programs, summer youth employment, senior transportation and NORCs are needed. Twenty percent of the our population is under 18 years of age. Our schools must have the necessary equipment (smart boards, computers, iPads, etc.) for our students to compete. The pandemic shows the inequities that exist with so many students unable to fully participte remotely due to the lack of equipment and internet connections. In today's world, our libraries have become multimedia centers that provide access to computers and the internet for adults and children. They serve thousands of New Americans and English learners who do not have access to home computers and/or the internet. It is vital that additional funds be provided to our libraries so that they may be open seven days a week and have up to date software and hardware for our residents. Additionally, the Department of Design and Construction takes too much time to break ground and start library projects. Initial funding for the Hollis Branch Library was in 2012. Nevertheless, the project is not yet in the design statge. As time passes, the cost increases and additional funding becomes necessary to do the renovation. ","","","","","Parks and open space","","PARKS - One of the most attractive characteristic of Community Board 8 is its suburban nature. Our residents value the many parks and playgrounds that we have within our borders. All of them are heavily used and, as such, they must be well maintained. The quality of our parks and park facilities is one of the most important issues facing our district. Community District 8 is fortunate to be home to many parks and numerous playgrounds. This is in addition to over 50 greenstreets. All of these park facilities require regular maintenance. There is always a need for new irrigation systems, updated playground equipment and safety resurfacing on a rolling basis.    Our major parks: Cunningham Park, Captain Tilly Park,  and Flushing Meadows Corona Park are used by thousands of our residents, those of neighboring districts and Nassau County. Our parks host major events such as an annual performance of the Philharmonic Orchestra attended by thousands of people. For many, our parks and playgrounds are the destination for families with children who have staycations. Some of our smaller parks/playgrounds such as Hoover/Manton Playground and Vleigh Playground are in need of upgraded play equipment and/or safety resurfacing.  We must keep our parks well maintained and safe havens for all our residents. To this end, funding for parks personnel and park facilities is a must.","Street conditions (roadway maintenance)","","STREET CONDITION - Many of our roads are in need of trench restoration. Each passing car, delivery truck and New York City bus add pressure to the roads and undermine the streets. We asked for funding for trench restoration for several locations which have been on our list for many years. Several of our bus routes have broken bus pads that require replacement. A plethora of NYC Transit buses (i.e. Q36, Q43, Q77, Q76, Q1, etc.) and Nassau buses traverse Hillside Avenue. These items have also been on our list for many years.","Street flooding","","SANITATION - Community Board 8 has many center medians along its major thorough fare that are not properly maintained on a consistent basis. They are located along Hillside Avenue, Francis Lewis Boulevard, Union Turnpike, Queens Boulevard, Main Street, 164th Street, etc. Each year, we must request weeding and debris removal from these medians. Months pass before they are addressed. With the return to organics collection, we noticed increased miss collection of regular garbage collection. The Leventhal’s agreement that assigns responsibility for maintenance must be revisited. Medians that have grass and trees fall under the purview of the Department of Parks and Recreation. The concrete part of the median falls under the jurisdiction of the Department of Transportation. Concrete medians that have trees fall under the jurisdiction of the Department of Sanitation; unfortunately, this agency is not properly equipped to address weeds growing out of tree pits. Unless, they have a special division that has the funds, equipment, and the training to properly maintain these medians, we will continue to have these issues in our communities. Furthermore, there was no contract to spray the weeds with herbicide this year. It took the longest time to get the medians addressed this year.","","","","","Other - Write In (Required)","","Community Board 8 supports funding for the expansion of access to primary healthcare services for those within CD8. We endorse the new paradigm of healthcare, not just sick care, which must include the traditional care provided by physicians and midlevel  health providers plus efforts to encourage healthy living. Some examples would be: nutritional education, programs for smoking cessation, exercise as part of one's routine and many others. Special emphasis must be placed on managing chronic diseases. Care managers should be utilized to ensure that individuals receive transdisciplinary health care with a goal toward controlling chronic disease, prevention of acute incidents, emergency room visits, hospitalization and optimizing independence. In today's world, we must also encourage every adult and eligible child to receive COVIC-19 vaccinations and subsequent boosters.

","According to the US Census of 2020 our population continues to increase. We understand that there are many benefits to seniors aging in place: 1) Keeping a familiar environment 2) Fostering community continuity 3) Maintaining their social networks 4) Strengthening of family ties 5) Fostering both their physical and mental wellbeing. We do not have any NORCs for our residents who reside in apartment buildings nor NORCs (WOW) for our 1-2 family residences within our district. We want our seniors to remain in their neighborhoods and the NORCs facilitate the desire of many seniors to age in place. These are done through the multi-faceted services that they provide. ","Community Board 8 has one family shelter in Briarwood and it is in dire need of air conditioning. The Briarwood shelter, when built was considered the model shelter for the City of New York. Unfortunately, this model shelter only has air conditioning in the areas where the staff works. There is no air conditioning where the residents sleep. We have asked for many years that air conditioning be provided for these families with children. The response received in FY 2016 was that DHS provides a cooling room in every shelter. When not available, the residents are given the location of other cooling rooms. How does that help the families with young children who cannot sleep at night due to the heat? The last three fiscal years the responses given were that further study was necessary. Keep in mind that when we originally requested this in Fiscal Year 2010, the response was that this was being studied. How long does it take to study this before action is taken? The residents of this shelter have been waiting a long time for this much needed accommodation and we look forward to a plan of action this fiscal year. Heat kills people.

The two major problems that arise are access to affordable preschool child care and enough after-school programs to meet the needs of these parents. One in five youth in Community District 8 from kindergarten through 8th grade is obese. It is vital to provide athletic opportunities both in and out of schools to lower this outrageous number. We support the retention and expansion of Gifted and Talented Programs in our schools.

This year has been particularly difficult as every day a certain number of our officers has been assigned to do tasks normally assigned to corrections officers at Rikers Island and lock-up in Queens Courts. ","About 20% of individuals who reside in Community District 8 are obese; hence, we must have the proper equipment to address their needs, such as two bariatric ambulances with lifts and special wheelchairs. We would also greatly benefit from a mobile emergency response vehicle (MERV), a rapid response vehicle and a mobile command vehicle for the borough. The MERV is to be used to shelter and treat individuals in one place in case of a disaster. The rapid response vehicle is needed to respod ahead with a liaison to coordinate during an emergencies. The ability to enhance or reestablish communication and coordination during emergency incidents is a must. It is best to be prepared by having the right equipment, as we do not know when emergencies or disasters will occur. ","","","","","Water runoff and flooding","","Community Board 8Q's Sanitation & DEP Committee, in conjunction with the Area Chairs, have identified water runoff and flooding as the most important Core Infrastructure and City Services needed for CB8Q. In recent years, we have seen a surge of storms that have placed a great burden on our sewer system resulting in flooded streets.  We have experienced serious flooding to our resident's and commercial establishment's basements and ponding of water on our streets throughout the Community District. Some storms have created flooding where residents had to abandon their cars and take refuge on the roofs of their vehicles. Flooding is a threat to both human life and property.    Ponding is increasingly a public health concern given the West Nile Virus and the possibility of future transmission of the Zika Virus.  Given the trend toward warming climates, other mosquito transmitted viruses currently found further south may be an issue a few decades into the future. We choose water runoff and flooding as our most important issue; however,  these are interrelated challenges that contribute to the city's capacity to handle increased rainfall.","","SANITATION - Although Community Board 8 has relatively clean streets, we have issues that need attention.

To further support this request for Building Code Enforcement, in recent years the Borough of Queens has had the second highest number of requests for code enforcement in the City making it vital that additional code enforcement be provided to Queens.","No comments","There is a need for affordable housing in Community District 8. There is a significant percentage of renters within our district who are rent burdened. According to the NYU Furman's Annual ""State of the City's Housing and Neighborhoods,"" our median monthly rent in 2014 was $1353. In addition, there was an increase in the rent burden for all renters from 17.4% in 2000 to 31.7% in 2014. There was an even more drastic change for those renters who have low incomes. It changed from 35.4% in 2000 to 58.5% in 2014. Community Board 8 had a change in zoning along Hillside Avenue that will facilitate larger developments. We are in dire need of affordable units set aside to address the great number of our rent burdened residents.  ","Our commercial strips could use a facelift by improving cleanliness and adding streetscape. We support giving small business owners incentives to improve their businesses located wihtin our community district. We welcome the establishment of Business Improvement Districts to help revitalize our commercial strips. ","","","","","Roadway maintenance","","In looking at the traffic and transportation infrastructure in CB8, the Transportation Committee recognized that street maintenance is our highest priority. Our roadways are deteriorating. many have become hazardous to motorists, cyclist and pedestrians. Many of our streets have serious potholes, sinkholes, sinkholes and depressions caused by motorists and pedestrians. Many of our streets have serious potholes, sinkholes and depressions caused by inadequate repairs after street excavations. Patchwork repairs are the norm where what is needed is a comprehensive plan to improve and maintain our streets and roadways. In addition, damage caused by oversized trucks and heavy vehicles on non-commercial streets have resulted in significant deterioration to the roadbeds and their substructure. The results of this have been the breaking of subterranean pipes which has caused street collapses. In our district resurfacing has raised roadbeds and reduced curbs on streets, center islands and malls. This causes surface water to overflow the sidewalks during heavy storms, curbs and properties in our community. Our City must focus on improving the streets and roads in Queens and stop deferring their maintenance. These improvements are sorely needed and can be visible proof to residents of Queens that our tax dollars are being used to improve our infrastructure and their quality of life.","In addition to the stated needs for street resurfacing, sidewalk construction and street reconstruction, there has not been any funds allocated for separate curb repair in over a decade. When curbs are broken, this condition creates a trip hazard. This makes the City liable for tort claims. Water collects where there are missing curbs and ultimately undermines sidewalks. Pedestrian and traffic safety are items of concern, as well. We request adequate funding for the installation of stop signs, traffic lights, traffic signs and cameras. ","Our community needs additional buses to service the growing population (i.e. Q76, Q30, Q20). The private bus lines were added to the Transit Authority fleet and still have no posted schedules (i.e. Q25, Q24 and Q65). This is a necessity for our seniors who are not technologically savvy and cannot use the MTA Bus Time App.  ","","","","","Quality of parks and park facilities","","One of the most attractive characteristic of Community Board 8 is its suburban nature.

It is imperative to have well trained and experienced staff for the smooth operation of our Community Board office. In the past, the Community Boards have seen their budgets fluctuate. When this occurs, the staff believes that their jobs are insecure, they look for other opportunities. Once new staff is hired, this means that many working hours are now devoted to training. These hours could be better spent working to address the community's concerns.  The COVID-19 pandemic showed that we must have hybrid meetings to reach most community members and make government more accessible. This adds to our technology cost. At present, to hold a hybrid meeting we must hire outside IT professionals in addition to paying for our meeting room rental. This costs our Board about $600 more per meeting, which is unsustainable.

Each is very distinct, yet all the residents have similar concerns and needs. Community Board No. 9 is truly a microcosm of the borough of Queens where our diversity is our strength. Like many New Yorkers, the constituents of Community Board 9 want safe streets, great schools, senior services, economic opportunity for local businesses, and access to quality parks and recreation. Additionally, we must take care of our most vulnerable citizens. During these difficult economic times, homelessness, hunger, and mental health issues have increased exponentially. It is important to fund programs that will assist these individuals as they struggle through difficult times.  Many City agencies have experienced severe budget cuts, and they are struggling each day to deliver essential services. NYPD, Sanitation, Transportation, Parks, and Department of Education are being asked to do more with less. After the budget modifications, the city is facing budget gaps of 6% of revenues next year, 8% in 2025 and 9% in 2026. This decrease in revenues will continue create stresses on city services.  Despite these budget concerns, Community Board 9 is still facing the construction of a multi-billion-dollar community-based jail in Kew Gardens. Consequently, the Board continues to ask the city for information regarding the new cost of construction, how much has been spent to date, and how the city intends to pay for this project.  Community Board 9 requests that the 102nd Police Precinct be considered for additional officers to combat the rise in crime, the proliferation of illegal cannabis shops, respond to nuisance complaints and keep the growing diverse population of residents safe.  Our local precinct does a fantastic job serving our community however, they need additional resources to deal with the many challenges they face each day.  We request that Department of Sanitation's budget be restored so they can service litter baskets, address illegal dumping, and keep local streets clean. Cutting funding to litter basket service will further exacerbate the current trash issue on our retail corridors.  Our sanitation department must be adequately funded to keep or streets and sidewalks clean.  The city must also ensure that the Department of Transportation (DOT) has the resources to continue paving our streets and conduct traffic studies to implement traffic safety measures. There are many dangerous intersections and street that require stop signs, traffic signals or speed bump to improve pedestrian and vehicular safety. It is vitally important that the DOT has the funding to receive requests, implement studies and install the appropriate measures.     Community 9 is concerned about the proposed cuts to education. According to reports, city schools will be making cuts at a time when educators say they require more resources to help the new students and continue the academic recovery following pandemic school closures. City officials said that the Education Department would be cut by $547 million this fiscal year and $600 million next year. NYC students deserve the latest technology, resources, and programs to receive a quality education in a safe leaning environment.  We owe our seniors a great debt of gratitude. Consequently, we have an important responsibility to ensure they have access to facilities that offer effective programs. If they choose to do so, seniors should also have access to technology and equipment to participate in programs and events remotely. Therefore, our senior centers should be fully funded to enhance the quality of life of our cherished seniors.  Community Board 9 has strong retail corridors comprised of small business owners. These businesses have been financially destroyed during that pandemic. However, through true grit and determination businesses are making a comeback. The city must provide grants, low interest loans, consulting services and clear guidelines to get these businesses back on solid ground. It is equally important that we make these retail corridors clean, attractive, and safe for customers. We encourage a Green Streets program along Woodhaven Boulevard and support street beautification projects Jamaica and Liberty Avenues.  Our parks provide a much-needed recreational outlet for residents. Forest Park is an incredible asset to the borough of Queens. Community Board 9 requests that funding be allocated for pruning, fencing and more Park Enforcement Patrol officers for Forest Park. Additionally, Phil ""Scooter"" Rizzuto Park great place for residents to enjoy. Consequently, Community Board 9 is supporting capital improvements to enhance the park for residents.  Libraries provide access to technology, information and are a great gathering place for residents of all ages. It's a place to access computers, it is all-inclusive, safe, and friendly environment, and a unique forum for social networking and reading groups. We request that the Woodhaven and Richmond Hill Libraries remain fully funded and the projects move forward in a timely manner.  Although we aware that the economic outlook FY2025 is bleak, our budget priority Capital and Expense Priority List targets many of the community needs and concerns. Community Board 9 respectfully calls on our esteemed elected officials to consider each request during their budget deliberations. ","","","","","Crime and Public Safety","","Public safety and quality of life issues continue to be a major concern for the residents of Community Board 9. These crimes include but are not limited to gun violence, assaults, robberies, speeding ATVs, and motorcycles. Our local precinct constantly responds to 311 quality of life complaints. Noise, drag racing, double parked cars, and menacing electric bicycles are impacting the tranquility of our quiet neighborhood streets. Additionally, the proliferation of illegal cannabis shops is negatively impacting our neighborhoods. Currently, the Sheriff’s Department and NYPD do not have the personnel nor the resources to deal with propagation of these “pot shops”. We do, however, recognize that the police do an outstanding job, but they need the funding, officers, and community support to keep our streets safe. ","Land use trends","","The preservation of our neighborhood is of paramount importance. Overdevelopment, Illegal conversions, and unsafe basement apartments continue to put undue pressure on city services and present a danger to tenants. During Hurricane, 12 people who died in New York City. Eleven of those people, were in basements when they perished. The city must do a better job ensuring that all tenants live in a safe and secure apartment. The looming construction of a borough-based jail in Kew Gardens is a top issue. Residents are concerned that the jail will put undue stresses on infrastructure, traffic, parking, and public safety. Community Board 9 is concerned about the package of citywide text amendments known as the City of Yes initiative. Particularly in opposition to lessening input from neighborhoods, Community Boards and elected officials in the planning, zoning and land use process through an increase in “as-of-right” conditions where presently commercial uses are limited or prohibited; and allowing unfettered commercial development on residential blocks throughout the city as per the 18 proposals included in this initiative. Community Board 9 is committed to working with elected officials and the Department of City Planning to create developments projects that are a benefit to the community.","Trash removal and cleanliness","","Our district is plagued with illegal dumping, trash accumulation along our retail corridors, derelict vehicles, and overall cleanliness on our streets. There must be a multi-agency approach to stop illegal dumping. The installation of surveillance cameras, the deployment of additional sanitation inspectors coupled with aggressive prosecution would help is stopping illegal dumping. Additionally, along our retail corridors litter baskets are being abused some residents who drop their household garbage. Cutting funding to litter basket service will further exacerbate the current trash issue on our retail corridors. The Department of Sanitation does an outstanding job responding and resolving our numerous complaints; however, we need to do a better job in preventing behavior that adversely impacts the cleanliness of our streets.","","","","","COVID-19 management (incl. vaccination, testing, outreach, education, etc.)","","According to the NYC department of Health there is still COVID-19 transmission in New York City and around the U.S. This is largely due to the spread of the more contagious delta variant and the large number of people who are still unvaccinated. NYC must ensure that everyone has immediate access to testing and vaccinations. Additionally, there must be comprehensive outreach and education so residents can make informed judgments of how to keep safe.","In CB9Q one in five adults has no health insurance and one in Eight go without medial care. 21% have no Health Insurance. 12% went without needed medical care. 8.2% had late or no prenatal care.

Three full zip code areas and half of a 4th zip code area are located within in Community Board 10. They are all the Howard Beach neighborhoods located within zip code 11414; all the neighborhoods located within Ozone Park's zip code 11417; all the South Ozone Park zip code 11420 neighborhoods; and approximately half of Richmond Hill South's zip code 11419. A small section of zip code 11430 is also within our boundaries. However, that zip code area is not populated, except for a homeless shelter, as most of that zip code's geography is located on-airport.  Queens Community Board 10 encompasses approximately 4,000 acres which is just over 6 square miles of the borough's land area.  Our district abuts JFK International Airport and Jamaica Bay. What occurs at both are important to our residents. New York City's only casino facility, Resorts World, is located virtually in the center of our Board area. All the communities within our Board District are in close proximity to it. People in all our district's various neighborhoods share similar concerns regarding current activity and future development plans at the casino. In 2021 a new hotel facility, a Hyatt Regency, opened at the casino complex and is a welcome addition.  As this is being written Resorts World is seeking to be selected by NY State to receive one of the downstate gaming licenses which would allow it to operate as a full casino with table games. We support that effort because Resorts World has proven to be a good neighbor and excellent corporate citizen during the 12 years that it has operated in our district. Resorts World has become an economic engine for our borough as well as for the State.   Community Board 10, located in Southwest Queens, is more racially diverse than other areas in Queens and NYC. Demographic data from the 2020 Census show there is no single dominant racial group within our population. Generally, our area is economically stable, however the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted economic stability of both our residential and business communities.  Our district has a large foreign-born population and a growing senior population. The 2020 Census showed that our population increased. However, historically our population has been undercounted by the Census and our true population is certainly higher than what is reflected by Census 2020. The most recent ACS 5-year estimates of population provide a better estimate of our actual population.  The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic are of great concern to our residents. Throughout that crisis DOHMH data indicated our neighborhoods consistently had high case rates in relationship to their populations. Vaccination rates show our Howard Beach zip code area has a lower rate of vaccination than our other zip code areas. That area consistently ranked among the zip code areas in the city with the lowest vaccination rates according to DOHMH data. During the worst of the pandemic it and our other zip code areas also showed higher rates of cases than many other areas in NYC. Parents are still concerned with the future of schooling for their children and addressing their post-pandemic educational and social needs. All our commercial strips consist of a mix of chain and ""mom & pop"" retail and restaurant uses. The economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the ""mom & pops"" have been devastating to many of them. There is a need for continued support from the city to both retail and restaurant uses now and for the long-term.  Approximately 1/3 of our district's land area was inundated by Superstorm Sandy's floodwaters in 2012. The immediate response to that disaster was generally acceptable given that it was the first coastal storm to do such major damage in so many areas of our city. As this is being written it is almost exactly 11 years later.  Our district's residents in the areas that were inundated are still extremely dissatisfied with the lack of long-term measures taken to protect their homes from a similar storm in the future. Sandy negatively impacted about 20,000 of our residents and caused damage to approximately 5,000 homes and many of our businesses. Now, more than a decade later, much needed resiliency projects and coastal protection projects supported by our residents are either nonexistent or are not moving forward in a timely manner.  While our Board area experienced no significant tidal flooding from Hurricane Ida in 2021, storm water flooding from Ida's then record-breaking rainfall overwhelmed the sewer system causing rain-water flooding damage to people's homes. These instances of storm-water flooding occurred in all parts of our Board area, not just within the sections located in the Sandy flood plain. Our Sandy flood plain area experienced significant tidal flooding during the winter storm event that occurred in December 2022. Homes were once again damaged. The level of flooding and damage experienced in that area of our district was very similar to that which occurred from Hurricane Irene in 2011. Most recently all areas of our district were negatively impacted by flooding and sewer backup as the sewer system was once again overwhelmed by the record-breaking rainfall that occurred at the end of September 2023. Along with flooding related to sewer system issues there was also extensive groundwater flooding that damaged people's homes throughout our district during that storm.  There is a pressing need to provide resiliency projects in a timely manner to protect the homes of all our residents from flooding, sewer backup, and groundwater as it appears to be certain that our city and our district will experience more and more serious coastal storms and rainstorms in the future. If we were to factor in the wind velocity that occurred in Florida in 2022 that we did not experience with either Sandy, Irene, and Ida or the December 2022 and September 2023 storms, much of our district in a future storm scenario could be ""wiped out.""   The following list of general needs reflect what people in our district complain about and/or ask for at their neighborhood meetings, in their calls to 311, in their contacts with Community Board 10 and to the elected officials who represent them:    Housing - continued building code enforcement; better strategies to provide adequate maintenance of vacant/abandoned homes; better strategies to identify current owners of vacant properties; effective requirements for ongoing maintenance of vacant homes; better protection from flooding.  Land Use - continued contextual rezoning in areas of our district not yet rezoned; implementation of resiliency projects; eliminating off-street parking requirement waivers for community facilities and commercial development; increased DOB inspection personnel; review/alter the DOB self-certification process; ensuring use/occupancy code-compliance.  Transportation - providing reliable bus service without reducing travel lanes for other vehicles; expanded express bus service; continued rehabilitation of all MTA ""el"" stations; increased accessibility to all ""el"" stations not yet made accessible; construction of southbound Aqueduct Station platform; maintaining current levels of on-street parking availability on all our commercial corridors and restoration of parking spaces eliminated to accommodate bus lanes; providing Q11 late night bus service; improved accessibility to Hamilton Beach; reduction of speeding; better enforcement of parking regulations; improved roadway infrastructure; periodical review of implemented traffic calming measures and correction of negative impacts; requiring Community Board review of parking regulation changes; posting more speed limit and no truck signage on residential blocks; better regulation of eBike, moped, and scooter use.  Parks - assigning maintenance personnel at each park daily; provision of year-round recreation services in parks; further expansion of summer programs for youth; providing appropriate recreation services and facilities for seniors; providing a recreation center; providing a swimming pool; providing an additional park facility north of Rockaway Blvd. within our district; further expansion of forestry service and increased forestry personnel.  Public Facilities - expanded library service; increased funding to Boys & Girls Club of MetroNY; provide for local review of youth services funding; construction of new schools and continued physical plant upgrades at existing schools; expanded school recreation, art and music programs; provision of additional senior centers; closing of the Skyway Men's Shelter and reopening former Skyway Family Shelter; elimination of use of hotels as shelters; requiring Community Board review of any and all proposed homeless shelters and/or hotel sites for serving homeless persons; requiring Community Board review of any siting for ACS facilities, relocation of Close to Home Limited Secure facility from its current South Ozone Park location.  Public Safety - increased permanently assigned police officers to the 106th Pct.; expansion of the NCO program; support for peace officer status for Resorts World security force; expanded noise violation enforcement; reduction of backlogs; reduction in response times; improved 311 complaint intake process and action taken reporting; increased critical infrastructure protection; expanded NYCEM education initiatives; expanded fire safety education; continued distribution of smoke and CO2 detectors.   Water, Sewer, Sanitation - need to inspect, clean, and repair all catch basins far more regularly; clean all catch basins annually prior to hurricane season; resolution of long-standing poor drainage conditions; continued installation of green infrastructure in poor drainage areas and require on-going regular maintenance of all green infrastructure; develop and employ better strategies to insure cleanliness of vacant lots; increase the number of litter baskets and expanded basket collection on commercial strips; provide daily collection of school garbage during 4-12 PM time period.  Economic Development - expanded business services; providing more direct grants to business owners in Sandy zone and to small businesses throughout the district negatively impacted by other storms, and the COVID-19 pandemic.  Resiliency, Sustainability - provide flood surge protection; continue to protect power supply; provide additional strategies to prevent sewer backup and ground-water flooding;  protect vulnerable populations; construct additional bulkheads on city-owned land abutting Shellbank Basin and Hawtree Basin; provide financial incentives to property owners to encourage additional elevations and/or relocation of critical building utilities; support and implement all city-related components of Howard Beach NY Rising recommended projects; provide financial incentives to homeowners in the form of tax credits or direct grants to implement resiliency improvements to their owner-occupied homes;  Community Boards - continue to baseline budget; improve 311 and other reporting systems.  The list above is by no means all-inclusive.    ","","","","","Crime and Public Safety","","1. Crime and Police-Related Quality of life issues  Community Board 10 has experienced an increase in major felony crime year over year during 12 of the last 23 calendar years. Assigning additional personnel to the 106th Police Precinct is Community Board 10’s top Expense Budget priority, as it has been for years.   Crime The precinct that serves us has experienced more years of Major Felony Crime increases during the last two decades than any other precinct in Patrol Borough Queens South. We experienced crime increases in 6 of the last 10 calendar years, which is also more years of increases than any other precinct in southern Queens. In four of the last 5 calendar years our crime has increased. Our crime has been growing, historically. Our call for more officers is not just driven by the current crime situation in our city. For years our Expense Budget #1 priority has been our request to add personnel to the 106th Pct. Our population, both residential and ambient, continues to grow and we need additional officers to reduce crime as well to better address Quality of Life complaints.  Our 106th Precinct has the second lowest number of Police Officers/Det. Specialists assigned in Patrol Borough Queens South as per NYPD FY25 Qns Consultations. The single precinct with less officers in PBQS than the 106th Pct. experienced 453 Major Felony Crimes in calendar year 2022 while the 106th Pct. experienced more than 1600 in calendar year 2022.  106th Pct. as of 9/1/21 (153 uniformed POs and Det. Specialists) as per NYPD FY23 Qns Consultations  106th Pct. as of 9/1/22 (133 uniformed POs and Det. Specialists) as per NYPD FY24 Qns Consultations  106th Pct. as of 9/1/23 (131 uniformed POs and Det. Specialists) as per NYPD FY25 Qns Consultations  Personnel data provided at the NYPD FY25 Qns Consultations for indicate that PBQS had 1,281 POs and Detective Specialists assigned to its 8 precincts. Only 131 were assigned to the 106th Pct which is 10.2% of the available PO/Det. Specialist personnel yet 15.1% of the Major Felony Crime in PBQS occurred in our precinct in calendar year 2022. Again, the single precinct in PBQS will a lesser share of the available Police Officers/Det. Specialists experienced nowhere near the amount of Major Felony Crime experienced in the 106th Pct.  Additional data provided by the NYPD at the FY25 Qns Consultations show the 106th Pct. during calendar year 2022 had 13 major felony crimes per 1,000 of population which reflects an increase over the previous year.  Five were violent crimes, and 8 were property crimes. During calendar year 2021 the 106th Pct. had 12 major felony crimes per 1,000 of population; 5 were violent crimes, 7 were property crimes as per NYPD FY24 Qns Consultations. We are also seeing that the percent of major felony crime occurring in our precinct in relationship to the amount of major felony crime occurring in Patrol Borough Queens South continues to increase each year.  Quality of Life Addressing Quality of Life issues is also of major concern in our district. Residents in our district regularly complain about Quality of Life issues via 311, at neighborhood civic association meetings, precinct Community Council and Build the Block meetings, and on social media as well as to our district office and to their elected officials. When the NCO Program was initiated by the NYPD our residents believed it would help reduce common quality of life complaints if regularly assigned officers were in their neighborhoods daily. However, we continue to see increases in quality of life complaints as these officers are often pulled from their assigned sectors.   At the FY25 Qns Consultations the NYPD reported there were 24,808 311 complaints in the 106th Precinct during calendar year 2021. That number increased to 26,256 in calendar year 2022 and during the first half of calendar year 2023 there were more than 12,000. It seems quite likely we will not see a decrease at the end of calendar year 2023. Most of the 311 service requests in our precinct are either noise-related or vehicle-related. In FY2022 95% of the 311 service requests reported by the Mayor's Office of Operations for the NYPD related to just 7 of the 21 total indicators reported on, 4 of those 7 indicators were noise related (residential, vehicle, street/sidewalk, commercial) The other 3 of those 7 indicators related to vehicles (illegal parking, blocked driveways, abandoned vehicles).  In FY2023 those same 7 indicators accounted for 96% of the service requests and each of those 7 indicators increased in number. ","Infrastructure resiliency","","2. Infrastructure and Resiliency Issues  Chronic flooding due to tidal events and ponding conditions due to rain events are unresolved issues for many of our residents. In 2012, almost exactly to the date of this writing, Superstorm Sandy negatively impacted a third of our district's land mass. Over 20,000 of our residents, and approximately 5,000 of our homes were flooded and damaged by Sandy. Almost all the homes in 3 of the 4 census tracts that comprise our Howard Beach/Lindenwood NTA were flooded and damaged.   Those homeowners suffered both physical and financial damage. In many cases neither FEMA assistance, flood insurance coverage, nor Build it Back aid was sufficient to meet their needs. Now 11 years later, there are still some homes unoccupied or unrepaired. There are still occupied homes not fully repaired. The Crossbay Blvd. commercial corridor and virtually all its retail and other establishments were damaged both physically and economically. Now, 11 years later there has been little done to afford future physical protection for our Sandy zone residents and businesses beyond the relatively few elevations done by Build it Back. Surge protection and other resiliency projects must be implemented at a far faster pace. For example, there are numerous city-owned street stub ends that abut Shellbank and Hawtree Basins in our Howard Beach and Hamilton Beach neighborhoods that are not bulkheaded or only partially bulkheaded. At this point 11 years after Sandy, EDC’s Raise Shorelines Project is addressing only 2 of them. All of them need to be addressed.  Our Hamilton Beach community is regularly experiencing flooding more frequently during minor storms and at other times as well. More needs to be done to address tidal flooding in Hamilton Beach. Hurricane Ida in 2021 impacted many of our residents in all parts of our district and overwhelmed our sewer system. Major sewer system improvements are needed throughout our district and long-standing roadway ponding conditions need to be corrected.   Programs need to be implemented to provide homeowners in our Sandy-impacted area with financial incentives whether through reduced property taxes, tax incentives, direct grants, or a combination of methods to encourage them to implement types of resiliency improvements that most are finding are costly and beyond their means to do. Similarly, Hurricane Ida has place burdens on those homeowners and renters impacted by it. They also require incentives to make their homes more resilient.   Uncertainty as to what the future holds regarding flood insurance faced by homeowners in our Sandy-impacted area may have a destabilizing impact on the neighborhoods in coming years if homeowners cannot afford either increased flood insurance premiums or the needed resiliency improvements to effect reductions in those insurance premiums. It is imperative that the city implement further coastal protection measures, to better protect our neighborhoods from the types of damage caused by Irene, Sandy, and the Dec. 2022 coastal storm as well as damage regularly occurring due to more frequent non-major storm tidal flooding It is also imperative that sewer system upgrades occur so that the burden is not solely on the Ida-impacted homeowners and those impacted by the Sept. 2023 rain storm. Areas where there are long-standing ponding conditions throughout our district must also be corrected. The realities of climate change will mean that we will experience more and more damaging weather events. ","Street conditions (roadway maintenance)","","3. Street conditions (roadways and traffic)  Our residents regularly complain of conditions where roadway maintenance is needed. Although we have had some milling and repaving, more is needed. Some streets within our neighborhoods have not been repaved for more than 20 years. All roadways in our district are suffering from more general wear and tear due to increased traffic. Therefore, they need to be maintained more frequently.   There is a need to ensure that when trenching occurs, whether by private contractors, utility companies, or city agencies, that repairs and repaving are timely and performed satisfactorily so that new ponding conditions or other problems with the street condition arise. At present, there is ongoing water main, gas main, green infrastructure, and pedestrian ramp construction in all parts of our district where trenching is a regular occurrence. Permanent repairs to those roadways, sidewalks, and curbs need to be done in a more timely manner. Our residents regularly have expressed their dissatisfaction with the repaving, especially on streets where there has been repeated trenching and strip repaving of trenches. Many residents on streets where there have been repeated strip repaving complain of uneven roadways and added drainage concerns. Blocks where there has been more than one utility trench repaired should be repaved curb to curb when the work is completed.  Residents and retail stores in our district regularly complain of negative impacts resulting from the implementation of bus only lanes on Crossbay Blvd. Traffic congestion increased and what was once just “rush hour” traffic now lasts longer. Additional parking restrictions have affected businesses and need to be adjusted. Many of the impacted businesses are small “mom and pop” businesses where loss of any of their customer base is harmful. This has been a particular hardship as they have struggled with pandemic economic impacts as well on their businesses.  Major construction is occurring on the Van Wyck Expressway. It will continue to cause more traffic on local residential side streets as vehicles divert to try to avoid congestion and construction zones. Our residents continuously request additional traffic control devices such as traffic lights, stop signs, speed limit signage, and “No Truck” signage to improve traffic control conditions on our residential streets.  In our district, as in all of southern Queens, truck parking in areas when no trucks should be parked is an ongoing and growing concern. Better strategies are needed to address this problem. More heavy-duty tow trucks are needed as well as more boots suitable for large trucks are needed. ","","","","","Programs, services or facilities for seniors (incl. remote programming, cooling centers)","","The ACS population estimates for 2017-2021 indicate our district’s older adult population has increased to 23.2% of our population being over the age of 60. That data now indicates the median age in our district still to be 41 overall, however there are areas within our district where the median age is much higher. Our population is aging with all the attendant health issues that come with aging. Should there be a Covid variant arise that current vaccines do not prevent or cause a lessening of symptoms for we have a large segment of our population at risk. In our Howard Beach NTA approximately 31% of its population is comprised of persons over age 60 and its median age is 46.4 according to ACS 2017-2921 data. However, three of the 4 census tracts within that NTA have higher percentages as well as a higher median age than the NTA as a whole. There is a need to provide more services to this vulnerable population. Another of our district’s 3 Neighborhood Tabulation Areas, Ozone Park, now has 20% of its people being over age 60 with a median age of 36.2. Our third NTA encompasses the largest geographic slice of our district, South Ozone Park. In raw numbers of older adults, it has the highest number. In this NTA 21.3% of its population is over age 60 and the median age is 40.9 according to 2017-2021 ACS data. It is an area where services to seniors in senior centers have been reduced.  There is only one city-funded senior center in our district. When services should have been expanding to meet the needs of our growing senior population, we have experienced services being diminished. There is a need to fully fund and open a senior center to serve our growing senior population in South Ozone Park. There is a need to expand services at our sole senior center located in our Howard Beach area where we have the highest concentration of older adults. The Health Department’s COVID-19 data provided by zip code throughout the pandemic consistently showed zip codes within our district as having had higher case rates when looked at in relationship to our population. Now as our city continues to endeavor to get people fully vaccinated and boosted, we have 1 of the zip code areas within our district having a lower percentage of total persons vaccinated than most zip codes in NYC. Our least vaccinated NTA has the highest percentage of older, vulnerable adults. There is no hospital facility in our district. ACS estimates indicate close to half of our Howard Beach NTA households include 1 or more persons over age 65 with close close to 42% of persons over age 65 having a disability. Of the 3 NTAs in our district our South Ozone Park NTA has close to 40% of its households as having at least 1 older adult resident and more than a quarter of its older adult population with disabilities. Our Ozone Park NTA has the least older adult residents and a younger median age. ","There is no hospital facility in the district to serve our population, many of whom are foreign-born, elderly, or both. In recent years, hospitals have been closed in Queens resulting in less beds within the borough to serve a growing population.","There is only one city-funded senior center located in our district. The sole city-funded senior center in our district was displaced by Superstorm Sandy in 2012. It now is operational at the Catholic Charities operated Peter Striano senior housing facility. This site is located in that segment of the district that has the largest concentration of older residents. Over 30% of our district's total of persons over age 60 reside in Neighborhood Tabulation Area QN57 where this senior housing/senior center facility is located. Available census related data seems to indicate that three of the four census tracts within NTA QN57 rank among the census tracts in the Borough of Queens with the most seniors. Some dated data showed census tract 892 tract ranking 5th highest in Queens in terms of its total number of persons over age 60 in 2012 .Census tract 62.01 in 2012 ranked 8th highest in the borough and census tract 884 then ranked 14th highest in the borough. The 2020 Census shows a similar pattern. Our other two NTAs also have sizeable older adult populations, yet there are no city-funded senior centers within them. There is a need to provide additional services within those parts of our district. Our seniors should not have to go to areas outside of Community Board 10 or their local neighborhood to attend a senior center and have programming available for them.  ","There is a need to close the Skyway Men's Shelter and reopen Skyway as a family shelter. There is a need to provide additional security at homeless shelters. There is a need to cease using hotels to house homeless persons. ","There is a need to provide a multi-service center facility to serve our low income and vulnerable residents. Such a facility would serve to be a one-stop location where information, services, and programs could be provided. There is a need to expand SNAP and all other services to low income residents, especially in light of pandemic impacts. ","","","","","School and educational facilities (Capacity)","","School seats are needed to serve the children of School District 27. Proper educational facilities with a full range of services are imperative for all children. Within those education facilities lessons learned from the Covid pandemic are that we need additional space in our schools to allow for proper social distancing and that our children now require additional programs and services aimed at addressing educational deficits that seem to have arisen due to long periods of distance learning. There is a need for programs in our schools to address the social and recreational needs of children who by necessity were separated from their peers for a long period of time during the many months of the pandemic. Our CB District needs less juvenile justice programs and more services for our school age children during and after school hours.","One new school was constructed in our district in recent years. It opened in Sept, 2017. However, additional school seats are still needed. Additional sites for new school construction must be located and construction must be expedited to ensure adequate educational facilities for our children. Over 20% of our population is under age 18. The influx of families with school age children continues, particularly in the northern and parts of our area. Many of the school buildings are overcrowded and parents see a diminished range of what is being offered to the students at the elementary school level. More art and music programs are needed. Parents are concerned with the quality of education and the safety factor as students move to the Middle Schools and the High Schools. The physical plants of many of our school buildings still need attention. Appropriate sites for additional Pre-Kindergarten services are needed. Every child in our Community Board area must have a seat in his or her neighborhood school and each school must provide a full range of educational services. As our city and district move forward post-pandemic there is a need to identify better ways to provide safety and provide full educational services to our children. Programs are needed that will identify and address educational deficits resulting from extended distance learning. ","ACS has established juvenile justice facilities within our district. Far better oversight of the provider agencies is needed.","","","","","General crime","","Crime and Quality of Life complaints are increasing. Personnel levels are decreasing.  Our crime has been growing, historically. Our call for more officers is not just driven by the current crime situation in our city. For years our Expense Budget #1 priority has been our request to add personnel to the 106th Pct. Our population, both residential and ambient, continues to grow and we need additional officers to keep pace with our crime rate increases. Addressing Quality of Life issues is also of major concern in our district. Please see our narrative earlier in this document in which we describe more fully both crime and quality of life concerns.","New York City's only casino is located in our precinct. Over 12 million people visit it annually and that number is growing. Other locations in the city with similarly high numbers of visitors are served with more officers than we are in relationship to population in the view of our residents. The casino facility is expanding. The ambient population of our community coupled with our resident population dictate that additional resources be provided to the 106 Precinct. Our police precinct has no parking facility. One is needed. Additional upgrades are needed to the stationhouse building.  Our district is adjacent to JFK International Airport. There are more than 300 acres of federal parkland within our district that are directly under flight paths. The Buckeye Pipeline that carries jet fuel to the airport runs through our district. As indicated above, the Resorts World Casino attracts large numbers of people on a daily basis. It could easily be a target for a mass shooting crime and/or terrorism. Much of the trucking carrying cargo to and from the airport traverses through our community. There is a need to provide more resources that better protect people and our critical infrastructure from potential terrorist attacks, both foreign or domestic. Additional cameras in our area are desired by our residents and, in the view of the Board, will serve to better protect people and aid in investigative activities.  ","Our growing population and the high number of illegal residential units created in cellars and attics point to a need for more emergency services and more/expanded educational programs. Close to half of our residents are foreign-born and some are unaware of basic safety practices common in the U.S. There is an increasing demand for fire services and our fire houses need upgrading of buildings and equipment.","","","","","Other - Write In (Required)","","Protective Infrastructure, sewer capacity, and addressing water runoff and flooding are all concerns in this category. Hurricane Sandy, Hurricane Ida, and the Sept. 2023 record breaking rain storm were clear indications that we have unmet needs. Please see our description earlier in this document in the most pressing issues section where we provide more detail. ","There are still areas within Community Board 10 not served by sanitary sewers as well as areas not served by storm sewers. There are numerous ponding conditions throughout the district for which solutions must be found. Our residents complain regularly of clogged and non-functioning catch basins. All catch basins in our Sandy zone need to be fully inspected, repaired if necessary, and cleaned on a far more regular basis. Prior to the onset of hurricane season each year and at any time when major coastal flooding is predicted it is imperative that all catch basins in our district's Sandy zone be cleaned. ","There are numerous dump out sites with CB10. They need to be cleaned more frequently. There is a need for additional mechanical broom service without requiring implementation of alternate street parking in our residential areas. Our commercial strips need additional basket services, particularly on Liberty Avenue which has a high pedestrian volume and residential uses above the stores. There is a need for the Bergen Landing DSNY facility to serve only equipment and personnel serving CB10. There is also a need for daily 4-12 pickup at every school in which there is food service. ","","","","","Commercial district revitalization","","All of our commercial districts need additional support to recover from the economic impacts from Hurricane Sandy, Hurricane Ida, and the Covid pandemic.","Studies related to increasing resiliency for homes and businesses in our Sandy zone need to be completed and programs need to be developed to offset the costs of resiliency improvements for homeowners and business owners. The same holds true for providing increased resiliency strategies for homeowners and businesses impacted by Ida and other rainstorms. ","There is a need for additional personnel to support enforcement efforts.","Economic development services are needed to assist businesses on our local commercial strips. All of our retail strips have been badly impacted by the current COVID pandemic. Many of our businesses are small ""mom & pops"" and will need a great deal of support in order to recover. ","","","","","Other - Write In (Required)","","All of our roadways are in need of regular maintenance. Traffic control requests are constant from our residents. There is a need for any continuation of Open Restaurants on our sidewalks and roadways to be reviewed on a case by case basis for all establishments. There is a need to continue making our elevated MTA stations fully accessible. There is a  need to improve bus service without negative impact to other motor vehicle use of our roadways. ","There is a need for expanded roadway maintenance, additional staffing at DOT to address ever-increasing deterioration of infrastructure, and reconstruction of streets and roadways in our district. There is a need to harden storm surge protection in our Sandy zone at all points where city roadways abut parkland at our shoreline and at all points where city street stub ends abut waterways. There is a need for expanded bus service without reducing roadway lanes available for other vehicles or available on-street parking. There is a need to not remove any of the existing turning lanes on Crossbay Blvd. south of Rockaway Blvd. There is a need to reconfigure 3 locations where merging traffic is problematic. ","There is a need to provide additional bus service without reducing available traffic lanes for other vehicles. Many of our residents expressed their opposition to plans presented to them for SBS service on the Crossbay Blvd./Woodhaven Blvd. corridor. Since its implementation they have expressed intense dissatisfaction as the congestion they feared would result has occurred. There is a need to revaluate and open the restricted bus lanes to other vehicular traffic except during the peak hours. ","","","","","Other - Write In (Required)","","Forestry services need to be increased. Sidewalks damaged by street tree roots must be repaired in a timelier manner. All public spaces under the jurisdiction of DPR should be visited and maintained daily. All of our libraries should be open 7 days a week with extended hours. Community Board budgets should be increased to allow for additional staff and equipment.","The area north of Rockaway Blvd. within CB10 is our most densely populated area. The only parks in that section of the district are at either end geographically which leaves a large segment of our population with limited access. Our Howard Beach area has a large older adult population but is served by only two joint operated school playgrounds which do not meet their recreational needs. A recreation center is desirable to better provide service to our residents. Superstorm Sandy damaged and destroyed much of our tree canopy in 2012 and subsequent weather events such as the Tropical Storm Isaias and Ida have caused more tree loss and damage. Forestry services must be expanded and must include better pruning of trees on a far more frequent schedule.  ","Cultural programming is desirable. However, there are limited sites available other than schools. Therefore, cultural programs within our schools should be expanded.","Library services are desired. CB10 supports the Queens Public Library's requests for new and renovated facilities and expanded service hours and programming. Due to lack of public transportation to the nearest branch library there is a need to construct a small library to meet the needs of our Hamilton Beach community. Within our Howard Beach area our Hamilton Beach community has the highest percentage of youth and walking to the Howard Beach branch is difficult. Our South Ozone Park community desires expanded library services. There is a desire that vacant city-owned land immediately adjacent to the existing South Ozone Park Library be utilized to expand the building and afford space for more programming. ","There is a need to permanently base-line the budgets of CBs. In local communities the services, outreach, and opportunities for public discussion we provide are needed. Our budgets need to be excluded whenever ""across the board cuts"" are initiated. This exclusion from cuts should be offset by the fact that our work is carried out not only with city budget dollars but with the contribution of pro-bono service our members provide. Our Chairpersons serve as agency heads. Although unsalaried, chairpersons perform numerous functions. They must attend numerous meetings within and outside of Board boundaries. Agency parking permits are needed for both District Managers and Chairpersons. More detailed information is still required as to what action was taken by agencies regarding the complaints made to 311 by our residents. All Community Boards should be provided with lists, at least on a weekly basis, of all complaints made to 311 within the district and the agency response to each. Many times complaints involve more than one agency to solve the issue. Having such lists readily provided without having to go to the Open Data Portal to filter and sort out complaints would be helpful as we would be better able to integrate them with complaints made directly to our office.  As we have conducted business remotely for much of the last 3 years needs have become apparent to better provide service remotely. Our staffs require better technology to work offsite. Maintaining transparency and providing public access to public Board meetings also require additional staff and equipment.

It is a thriving upper, middle income community with a median household income of almost $81,000. The District has a mixed white, non-Hispanic (52%) and a growing Asian (43%) population. The population has a substantial elderly (over 65) population, at 18%. Over 29% of our households have children under 18 years of age. New homes continue to be built in the district along with the enlargement of existing homes to accommodate an increasing population of families attracted by the educational opportunities in the district. Elderly homeowners are selling their homes to relocate, often to the garden apartment complexes in the area. Many of the new homes are much larger than the existing housing stock and is changing the character of the neighborhoods. In areas that are zoned for multiple families, homes are being renovated to reflect that zoning. Our community is becoming denser as the population continues to grow. We are, in turn, experiencing increases in traffic and an increased concern about transportation needs and safety. There are many new, larger commercial developments along the commercial overlay zones. Small commercial strips have been replaced by larger retail stores, offices, and community facilities. Many sites accommodate multiethnic businesses in response to the needs of the growing Asian population in the district. Hotels are being built in the district for the first time. Marriott is building two hotels due to the close proximity of Queens to the airports, Citi Field, the USTA stadium, and transportation to Manhattan while being more affordable than a hotel room in Manhattan. The number of health care facilities has increased throughout the district, both newly constructed buildings and conversions of private homes. ","","","","","Parks and open space","","CB 11 residents love their parks and trees. This district has several large parks and tree-lined streets. Street and park tree maintenance, renovation of ball fields, and park improvements are all important to the residents of CB 11, as they add to the attractiveness of the neighborhoods and the quality of life the residents enjoy. The preservation of the wetland areas and protection from development is of paramount importance in the north end of the district which borders Little Neck Bay.","Quality of life issues (noise, graffiti, petty crime, etc.)","","The goal of neighborhood preservation in Community Board 11 is to preserve the special qualities that have made lower density, suburban-style neighborhoods in northeast Queens attractive.  There are also two landmarked districts in CB 11.  As the City has grown, so have concerns about how much development is good for the community. The Board supported rezoning to prevent out-of-character over-development. However, there are still concerns with zoning and building violations and how the City responds to these complaints. ","Street conditions (roadway maintenance)","","Street conditions and traffic issues have become a growing problem. We have seen increased traffic and roadway complaints such as poor road conditions and potholes and need for pavement markings.  Four highways intersect through the district adding to the traffic on local streets. There has also been increased demands for speed bumps and other traffic calming devices as traffic has increased with our growing population. ","","","","","Programs, services or facilities for seniors (incl. remote programming, cooling centers)","","With a large senior population,  the community has had only one full service DFTA funded senior center: the Bayside Senior Center. Through advocacy for more senior services, the Samuel Field Y is now funded to operate a center at their Little Neck facility. The Y also operates the Deepdale NORC at one of the district's co-op garden apartment complexes. Services Now for Adult Persons (SNAP) provides casework management for all of CB 11.  We have participated with our the local councilman, the NY Academy of Medicine and DFTA to make sure that the district is more age-friendly. Transportation for seniors for health visits and shopping is sorely lacking in the district especially since the residents are dependent exclusively on cars and buses. We also have an increasing elderly Asian population in need of services addressing their language and cultural needs. Each of these agencies have had to address those needs.","No comments","Our district has one of the highest senior populations in NYC, at 18% of the population. We have only one DFTA funded senior center, the Bayside Senior Center, located in the district. We have advocated for increased services and DFTA did provide additional funding for the Samuel Field Y to run a full service center in the eastern section of the district.  We still advocate for more senior services in the western part of the district, in the Auburndale area.","No comments","No comments","","","","","School and educational facilities (Maintenance)","","Education  Partnering with Community Education Council Districts 27, 28 and 29 has been our priority for many years and we are proud to continue to stand with the staff, parents and students within these districts for education quality and equity.     The years of Mayoral control by the previous administration caused our CDE Councils to take a considerable beating.  It was extremely difficult to manage all of the issues brought by the Bloomberg administration, yet we persevered in dealing with issues such as: the effectiveness of the ATR (Absent Teacher Reserve) pool, the “Blue Book” – a document that did not provide trusted, definitive school space utilization information, “Testing to the Test”, the premature roll out of Common Core Standards, school closures, and persisting co-locations of multiple schools within one building.    On numerous occasions, the Education Committee of Community Board 12 expressed our disapproval of the premise of co-location. Districts 27,28 an 29, were part of a detrimental co-location landscape that the Bloomberg administration was determined to carry out prior to his leaving office. Thus we were faced with multiple co-location proposals aimed at our elementary, middle and high schools. Under the guise of ""under-utilization,"" educators were notified that their schools must make way for other schools deemed ""high quality"" by the DOE. The term was unproven in most case and highly offensive to those associated with the incumbent schools.    Proposals for Southeast Queens included three (3) co-located schools with elementary and intermediate schools in existing co-location environments; a sixth (6th) co-located high school at Campus Magnet High School, and of most notable concern to us was a proposal to co-locate Success Charter Academy Elementary School (kindergarten through 4th grade) within August Martin High School, a co-located high school of three (3) schools - one of which, Voyages Preparatory High School, integrates adult-aged students up to the age of 21. Community Board 12 voiced opposition to this irresponsible proposal in our testimony to the NYC Department of Education and SUNY Charter Schools Institute. The proposal was not approved.    In addition, Community Board 12 opposed the co-location of Q312 with PS 40; the co-location of Q332 with IS 72 and P.S. 993; and the co-location of Success Charter Academy Elementary School with IS 59 and P.S. 176. Most recently, we provided testimony to oppose the inclusion of New Visions Charter School within August Martin High School, joining the myriad of other schools co-located in the building. Although we were unsuccessful in that effort, we will continue to be adamant regarding our position on school co-location within our districts.      Increasing class enrollment for preschool through high school-aged children persists as the population in our CDEC districts continues to rise. The need for the School Construction Authority to expand building plans in Community Board 12 continues as does the need for decreasing class size at every grade level. Additional after school programming and recreational community centers for middle and high school-aged children is essential to Community Education Council Districts 27, 28 and 29. We also request the implementation of effective school safety zones, traffic lights and speed bumps in the vicinity of every school and learning center in our CDEC districts.","","Community Board 11 consists of School District 26, which is both high achieving and over-crowded. More programmatic funding us needed to adequately serve our students. ","","","","","General crime","","Fortunately, crime statistics for the major felony crimes in this district are low. It is our property crimes that cause the most concern.","Felony crimes are low in the 111th Police Precinct. Burglary and Grand Larceny and Petit Larceny account for the majority of our reported crimes. The burglaries include home break-ins and car breaks-ins. Auto theft has decreased dramatically but still accounts for overall crimes in the district. Another concern is the increase of mail fishing cases.","Generally CB 11 is pleased with the services received from our police, fire, and emergency service workers. We want to enhance their abilities to service the public.","","","","","Water pollution control","","CB 11 borders Little Neck Bay and there are kettle ponds, lakes, and ravines within the parklands. Residents want to ensure that the waterways are clean and that we control and reduce pollution into the bay. The Board has worked with DEP on their Long Term Control Plans to reduce pollution. The District also will benefit from the installation of green gardens in the coming year in areas where there are combined sewer systems.","The north end of the district borders Little Neck Bay on the Long Island Sound. This board has worked with the NYSDEC and the Dept. of Parks to preserve and protect the area's wetlands and improve the quality of water in the bay. Some areas are in the hurricane zones and there is concern that intensive storms could flood areas around the bay. There are many old seepage basins in the area and many no longer function properly. They need to be removed and replaced with a storm sewer system. We also have a large area of combined sewer lines. There have been several projects recently in CB 11 to install catch basins and sewer lines and replace old water mains. The repair of our DEP infrastructure is important to maintain our streets and water services. Bioswales are also being installed in the district to capture storm water before going into the combined sewer system and the bay.","CB 11 is fortunate to be rated very high on clean streets and sidewalks because residents take pride in the neighborhood and work to keep it clean.  We do not receive daily litter basket collection and broom sweeping. The need for these services has grown with an increasing population and traffic.","","","","","Land use and zoning","","Rezoning started in our Bayside community and, since 2004, all of the district was rezoned to reflect more accurately the development in the various neighborhoods. Ensuring zoning compliance and building code enforcement has been a great concern to our residents. There has been a great deal of home construction and an increase in illegal conversions and illegal uses of property. There is a concern with the loss of green space with the increase in development.","The Department of City Planning (DCP) rezoned 350 blocks of Bayside in 2004, 135 blocks of Douglaston and Little Neck in 2006, 50 blocks of North Flushing/Auburndale in 2009, and 418 blocks of Auburndale, Hollis Hills, and Oakland Gardens in 2010.  The goal of rezoning was to curtail overdevelopment and maintain the low density nature of the district. New zoning designations were also introduced for single family homes, R2A and R1-2A, to limit the size of homes. Ensuring compliance is important to residents to maintain the suburban-like feel of the neighborhoods in CB 11.  There has been an increase in complaints to the Dept. of Buildings for illegal commercial use in a residential zone, illegal conversions, and illegal occupancy.  Residents are still frustrated by the perceived inability of the Buildings Department to stop illegal construction, violation of zoning laws, and illegal occupancy. DOB must continue to be funded to maintain an adequate number of plan examiners and inspectors. Many times, inspectors do not obtain access to the premises they must inspect. Access warrants are difficult to obtain in the courts, and the complainants feel that nothing is being done to stop illegal conditions. Unfortunately, in many cases this may be true, but balancing private property rights with government enforcement continues to be problematic.","No comments","This district has several thriving commercial strips along its main avenues.    Bell Boulevard, between Northern Boulevard and 35 Avenue, is a Business Improvement District (BID). The BID helps fund improvements along the Bell Boulevard commercial strip. The Economic Development Corporation, working with the BID, has plans for a streetscape project on Bell Boulevard.  The BID also sponsors events to attract new businesses and shoppers to the boulevard.  This strip is known for the diversity of ethnic restaurants and nightlife in its various bars and restaurants. A concern of the residents is the continued closure of small businesses on Bell Boulevard being replaced by only bars and restaurants. The scarcity of parking spaces is also an issue that has been raised since it is necessary to attract customers.  The BID is advocating the construction of a parking structure.     Adjacent to the Douglaston LIRR Station, on the north side of the tracks, many businesses closed. The Douglaston Local Development Corporation, formed by local residents, is working to revitalize the area. The LDC maintains the  DOT Public Plaza on the north side of the LIRR station and sponsors public events.  Along Northern Boulevard, several new commercial retail stores are being developed. While many of the stores have been leased, there seems to be a lot of turnover and many stores remain vacant. In the meantime, businesses are also closing in the older storefronts along these commercial strips. Two hotels are under construction on Horace Harding Expressway and Utopia Parkway. This is a major change in the neighborhood. In Little Neck, in the one M1-1 district in the board,  a new business, a watch assembly plant,  has taken over an old business that moved and another new building will be constructed to house a Northwell Health Core Laboratory for NYC Health + Hospitals and Northwell Health System.","","","","","Traffic safety and enforcement (cars, scooters, ebikes, etc.)","","The Community Board office is receiving an increasing number of complaints and concerns about traffic safety due to the increase of bicycle lane miles in the district, mainly along Northern Boulevard between Douglaston Parkway and 223rd Street. There are numerous Parkway entrances, curb cuts and bus stops which make this bicycle lane safety-reducing and congestion-creating.     Also, there are many requests for traffic calming devises such as speed bumps, speed cameras, four-way stops, turn signals, and redesign of roads in order to make the roads in Community Board 11 safer for drivers and pedestrians.","Four major expressways and service roads intersect CB 11: the Long Island Expressway, the Grand Central Parkway, the Clearview Expressway, and the Cross Island Expressway. Resurfacing and maintenance of roads is a priority to the Board. Comptroller Stringer ClaimStat Alert cited the Grand Central Pkwy and the Long Island Expressway as the thoroughfares generating some of the highest number of pothole claims. This district has one of the highest rates of car ownership.  There is no rapid transit; there are express and local buses and the Port Washington branch of the Long Island Railroad.","The residents of CB 11 are totally dependent on buses, car services, personal cars and the Long Island Railroad for their transportation needs. This Board also has one of the highest percentages of families with cars.  Express buses and the Port Washington Branch of the LIRR are the most efficient methods of travel to Manhattan. Otherwise, bus service to subway lines in Flushing, Kew Gardens or Jamaica is necessary. Concerns with frequency of service has often been a concern to residents.","","","","","Street tree and forestry services (including street tree maintenance)","","This district has three large parks and the streets are lined with street trees. The maintenance and care of the trees has been a major concern of our residents especially following property and personal damage from storms in recent years. Comptroller Stringer, in his report ""CompStat"", cited the Parks Dept. claims as one of the highest. The longer a tree pruning cycle is, the higher the number of claims.","Parks and trees are the gems of this district. There are approximately 900 acres of parkland in CB 11. There are three large parks, three smaller park areas, lakes, a golf course, a golf driving range, a marina, many GreenStreets and streets that are lined with trees. CB 11 is on the North Shore of Queens overlooking Little Neck Bay and has extensive wetlands. Alley Pond Environmental Center sits on parkland at the edge of the wetlands.

It is the second largest Board in the Borough of Queens and takes up a large portion of the southeastern corner of the Borough.  Officially, according to the 2010 census, we have a total population of 225,919 people.  The number does not reflect nor acknowledge an under-count. The District has become a more culturally and ethnically diverse community. It is situated in the well-known flood basin of the world’s largest dam; John F. Kennedy Airport. The Airport, built on wetlands, which was our natural drainage area, has greatly contributed to a lack of adequate rainwater run-off in our community. We continue to suffer from serious infrastructure problems; our roads and sewers are inadequate to serve our community needs. A great deal of street repair has been done in Community Board 12, much more remains undone. At this time $2 Billion dollars have been allocated to Southeast Queens for flooding by the Mayor. We are faced with a serious ground water issue, in which hopefully there will be a study on ground water.    Finally, through all of our struggles our communities will survive.  But, we cannot ignore the fact that basic municipal services are minimal.  Extra help now will keep us stable and prevent the need for excessive amounts of rehabilitation and revitalization dollars in the future.    The needs in each community are different.

The term was unproven in most case and highly offensive to those associated with the incumbent schools.    Proposals for Southeast Queens included three (3) co-located schools with elementary and intermediate schools in existing co-location environments; a sixth (6th) co-located high school at Campus Magnet High School. Community Board 12 voiced opposition to this irresponsible proposal in our testimony to the NYC Department of Education and SUNY Charter Schools Institute. The proposal was not approved.    In addition, Community Board 12 opposed the co-location of Q312 with PS 40; the co-location of Q332 with IS 72 and P.S. 993; and the co-location of Success Charter Academy Elementary School with IS 59 and P.S. 176. Most recently, we provided testimony to oppose the inclusion of New Visions Charter School within August Martin High School, joining the myriad of other schools co-located in the building. Although we were unsuccessful in that effort, we will continue to be adamant regarding our position on school co-location within our districts.      Increasing class enrollment for preschool through high school-aged children persists as the population in our CDEC districts continues to rise. The need for the School Construction Authority to expand building plans in Community Board 12 continues as does the need for decreasing class size at every grade level. Additional after school programming and recreational community centers for middle and high school-aged children is essential to Community Education Council Districts 27, 28 and 29. We also request the implementation of effective school safety zones, traffic lights and speed bumps in the vicinity of every school and learning center in our CDEC districts.","It is extremely important that quality educational programs be provided in our district, these include programs outside of the classroom like recreational programs, homework programs and other after school programs.","Need for Youth Education  It is extremely important that quality educational programs be provided in the school within our district, these inlcude programs outside of the cklassroom, hmework programs andother after school programs.

With the $2.2 Billion dollars that were allocated to southeast Queens, a number of projects were done but, there is more to be done","Flooding is a major problem in Community Board 12 due to a poor drainage system and a high level of ground water. Some homeowners are forced to have pumps installed in their basement but, that is not addressing the problem. Ongoing meeting have been held. A number of projects are schedule to move forward, these are all small projects that will not be addressing the major problem. Two point two hundred billion dollars have been allocated to southeast queens to address the flooding condition by the Mayor. ","We are facing a major problem with Sanitation, dumping is a major problem. We must have more strict enforcement not less; there is a need to deal specifically with illegal dumping. We need additional manpower for street cleaning, dump-outs, and litter basket operations. Some of the dumping is in the residential area, where there are high number of vacancies due to foreclosure. In order to have cleaner streets in the residential areas, you must have alternate side of street parking in which we do not have in majority of the areas ; so the mechanical broom can clean the curb. ","","","","","Affordable housing creation","","It’s a major issue in the district with all the proposed housing units and economic development in progress, we will have an increase in population and businesses, our local merchants need help to remain stable and profitable.  Community Board 12 Economic Development Committee is working with the Local Development Corp. and business groups on some of our commercial strips.","We have an affective Land Use Committee in Community Board 12 that addresses all land use items that come before the board.","It's a major issue in the district with all the proposed housing units and economic development being planned there will be an increase in population and business groups in some of our communities. Our local merchants need help to remain stable and profitable. We are having a major problem in the district with abandoned houses; two to three years without being sealed up squatters in and out. we have a high rate of vacancies due to foreclosures. Any abandoned house in a community has a great effect on the quality of life on all home owners in the Community. In Community Board 12 district, we need additional building inspectors to address working without a permit, illegal conversion, single room occupancy (SRO's), and working on weekends. The problem continue to escalate, illegal use must not just be cited, this must not be allowed to continue. There continues to be a lack of enforcement in Community board 12, we need Consumer Affairs and the Department of Health.

Economic development is important for a vibrant and stable community. The new economic development plans that have been proposed in this district will hopefully address unemployment is an issue also. ","","","","","Traffic congestion","","There is a serious problem with commercial traffic in residential area during weekends and overnight.

It is made up primarily of one- and two-family homes, with three large clusters of garden coop apartments and a scattering of apartment buildings. The district encompasses sixteen distinct communities, which includes: Bellaire, Bellerose, Brookville, Cambria Heights, Floral Park, Glen Oaks, Laurelton, Meadowmere, New Hyde Park, North Shore Towers, Parkside Terrace, Queens Village, Rosedale, Springfield Gardens, Warnerville and Wayanda. There is a strong sense of neighborhood identification in each of these communities. First and foremost, the 116 Precinct is presently being constructed. Communities on both sides of the district are pleased that additional law enforcement with increased personnel will soon become the norm, which will help alleviate the random criminal activity and quality of life issues always popping up.   The other changes happening are major development occurring in two distinct locations on the edges of the district.   On the southwest border, an Amazon distribution facility has been built and is now operating, with a new milk distribution plant beginning construction. Adding to that, four new terminals at JFK Airport are being redeveloped and expanded while presently under construction. These projects will certainly increase the already overburdened roadways with additional traffic. NYC DOT has done some studies, but as these facilities become fully operational, will it be able to assess the full impact on the surrounding communities.  The overwhelming number of complaints received relate to speeding on residential streets. Requests for traffic mitigations including STOP signs, traffic signals and speed humps to make these side-streets safe for residents and pedestrians.  The other major issue affecting the board is the Humanitarian Emergency Response and Relief Center (HERRC) constructed in August near Hillside Avenue on the Creedmoor Campus with accommodations for 1000 men. Its presence has created major concerns for the public school and athletic fields across the street, the senior center immediately adjacent, and the YMCA a block away. These migrants - understandably - wander around the communities frightening residents necessitating an increased police presence.  Other issues affecting the entire board are the proliferation of homeless shelters. Being located next to an airport, many smaller hotels existed to serve travelers. Yet, with state legislation requiring all NYC residents to have a right to shelter, and the lack of affordable housing, the city has taken advantage of using these smaller hotels to house the homeless. Service providers and hotel owners' contract for use with the surrounding community being notified shortly before these new residents move in. This community district seems to have more than its fair share of these shelters which often negatively affect quality of life in the immediate area.  There are many dead trees and tree branch complaints, sidewalks uplifted because of tree roots, and residential yards and driveways being used as auto repair facilities. The many beautiful parks and playgrounds in the district need more staff and equipment for the tremendous maintenance demands. Illegal dumping occurs wherever there is open land - on a road that transverses our park wetlands, and all along the highway service roads. The paving over of front and backyards (losing permeable land area) is another issue as homeowners attempt to create additional parking for their vehicles. Enforcement by DOB is spotty and ineffective which thereby creates conditions for additional water going into the sewer system in areas that have historically had flooding problems.    ""Smoke Shops"" are proliferating throughout the district on our commercial strips, in many cases selling cannabis without a license. Yet, a slew of applications for legal cannabis dispensaries have been received by the board to review. As this process is rolled out; and with the uncertainty of the role the community boards will play in the siting of those given licenses, there is a tremendous amount of concern how these businesses will affect quality-of-life in these areas.    ","","","","","Land use trends","","New York City has an affordable housing shortage that has garnered a tremendous amount of attention from our local elected officials. Many use this issue as a policy they will prioritize as they run for office. QCB13 is a semi-suburban, bedroom community whose residents move here for the ""lack of density"" and bucolic neighborhoods, away from those areas of the city so densely populated. A huge priority for this district is neighborhood preservation without being imposed upon with issues affecting other areas of the city. It is of the utmost importance for this district to keep the zoning policies that have been fought for and put in place over many years of planning and struggle.   ","Parks and open space","","The district has enormous amount of parkland including three big parks (Brookville, Springfield and Idlewild Parks) and many playgrounds. Additionally, there are parks properties including center medians, wetlands and grassy areas parallel to the highways. The Department of Parks and Recreation needs more equipment and personnel to respond to the level of activity at these areas, as well as the numerous maintenance requests from the community during the warm weather months when the grass grows high so quickly. In the two big parks volunteer groups also look for gardeners to assist in their beautification efforts.  ","Traffic","","QCB13 receives an unending stream of requests for speed humps. Many of our ancillary streets are wide and parallel to primary arteries; consequently, they are used as alternative routes to get past traffic. Possibly these requests reflect that many motorists simply do not respect the speed limit of 25 mph and speed down residential streets posing safety concerns for everyone, especially older people and children.  More funding is needed for DOT so more studies can be conducted and mitigation measures implemented more quickly.","","","","","Environmental health issues (noise, lead, respiratory illness, moisture, mildew, mold, etc.)","","The southwestern part of the district borders the runways at JFK Airport. As such, residents are exposed to huge jets landing right above their homes and the noise and possible remnants of fuel dumping occurring immediately on them - day and night. In addition, many of the jets are bringing cargo to freight businesses located in the same area which bring trucks - 53 foot tractor trailers constantly coming and going with their noise and air pollution, not to mention the struggle to keep these enormous vehicles from illegally parking on local streets. ","","Expediting the capital funding for Services Now for Adult Persons (SNAP) new building on Union Turnpike. Presently, this organization is located on the Creedmoor Campus which is dilapidated and otherwise unoccupied. This agency serves many seniors in the distict with outstanding services and urgently needs to get into this new facility. The funding stream has been mired in beaurocratic red tape with allocations from governmental agencies at all three levels. It is imperative that things get worked out to allow for this building, easily accessible by both car and bus, and in the central part of this eastern Queens commuity, before this not-for-profit organization has to leave its present deteriorating building with nowhere to go and its valuable services cut to so many seniors in need. The issues here have been compounded by the installation of a city-operated HERCC which houses 100 migrant men.  ","The migrant crisis has superceded the homeless issues in NYC. Having a HERCC on the Creedmoor Campus adds an additional burden to our commuities. It remains to be seen how long the city can continue to undertake this enormous Federal responsibility. Yet, support services from the city - especially with security - are required to keep a sense of safety and coordination for our communities.  Understanding that homelessness is a citywide issue, we support the City identifying abandoned properties and converting them into affordable housing through various programs that are already underway. With respect to those sheltered in hotels located within the Board area, we would like DHS to look at other communities as this Board has more has more than its fair share. ","There are families with ""special needs"" individuals within this district that would like to see programming and education for both teenagers and adults that will lead to job opportunities allowing them a level of independence. ","","","","","Educational attainment","","Since students are still trying to make gains in their educational achievement, the focus continues to be in that area. Chancellor Banks is looking to revise the way reading is taught; and as a result, students will need more assistance learning the new methods. It is our hope that the Chancellor's policies take this into account and fund whatever enhanced teaching techniques will elicit better performance in learning reading from the schools in our district.  We also continue to be concerned about student's mental health and request an expansion of mental health services in schools in our district.","In past years we have made specific requests on behalf of individual schools only to discover that any capital improvements are ultimately decided by the CEO of that individual school, the Principal. Community boards normally do not have regular contact with principals, and only with parent leaders if they happen to be board members or volunteer as committee members.  District 29 has notorioulsy been laden with under-achievement among its students. Many schools do not have the sports teams and other extra-curricula activities that create a rich learning environment. We request  sufficient funding for the in-person learning with the requisite measures needed to keep students, teachers, administation and staff safe. ","No comments","","","","","Traffic violations and enforcement","","In alignment with another priority in the district - the unending requests for traffic mitigations - more enforcement against speeding. Understanding that we are presently in a random violent crime epidemic, the priority of the NYPD is for addressing these heinous crimes seemingly occurring every day and being highly publicized.  But there is another, less lethal and less publicized need for public safety in this district with cars speeding wherever they can without consequence. Speed cameras work but are limited in amount and location. Periodic traffic enforcement blitzes at strategic locations will go a long way in having the residents our communities feel safer.  Local laws and recent court decisions have hamstrung the police's ability to respond and mitigate quality of life issues that seem endlessly to occur when people are not comfortable speaking to their neighbors.  ","Historically, community policing has reduced crime and promoted better relations with residents. The program of Neighborhood Coordinating Officers (NCOs) has worked incredibly well in the 105 Precinct, and so far has been quite effective in solving the many quality of life issues that occur on a daily basis.  Unfortunately, the community is using the NCOs so much that they are becoming weary. In light of the precinct size and many distinct neighborhoods, additional police assigned to the NCO Program is requested. Illegal truck parking on some of our larger streets remains a problem. There is enforcement by the 105 Precinct with summonses, and a special focus from Patrol Borough Queens South , but the fine amount is clearly not a deterrent. The problem with ""booting"" is there is no lot to tow the booted vehicle if it remains in the same spot for more than 3 days. It would be helpful if  the City located a place to tow these ilegally parked and booted trucks, and to raise the fines for tickets.    Finally, given the requirement to have two officers on-site near the migrant HERRC, additional police officers assigned to the 105 Precinct. ","The Fire Safety Education Unit's programming have been very successfl in raising awareness in our communities. Over the past few years there have been some catastrophic fires with lives lost. This had occurred as the wood framed houses had too many people and no plan for escape. The program of free alarm installations in conjunction with the Red Cross is quite popular and provides an added a layer of safety for many homes. In addition, making young people aware of fire safety through various events on different media platforms will reap untold safety rewards. This programming needs to remain and must be robust. ","","","","","Cleanliness/trash collection","","On the major commercial strips garbage accumulates rapidly. Whenever there is a public trash can it becomes a magnet for bags of [uncollected] residential waste. This problem is so bad many store owners do not want waste baskets in front of their businesses because of the inevitable sanitation ticket that gets issued though most times they are not at fault.     Along the service roads that abut the four highways bordering the district (Grand Central Parkway east; Cross Island Parkway north and south; Laurelton Parkway north and south; Belt Parkway east and west), there is a lot of dumping of construction waste and general garbage both inside and outside of the highway barrier fence. There is also dumping on wetlands and grassy areas, specifically, the area of Brookville Boulevard known as ""Snake Road"" (between 149 Avenue & Rockaway Boulevard). These ""dumping grounds"" are managed by DOT and Parks, respectively. Neither of these two agencies have the capacity to keep up with the necessary cleaning which then requires coordination with DSNY on a periodic basis.  Finally, and unfortunately, too many people litter and there needs to be a public campaign vilifying those who randomly drop their trash on the ground.","","- Routine cleaning of vacant lot locations where frequent dumping occurs.  - Public outreach at transit hubs and along commercial strips about not littering.  - Outreach to schools and community centers on not littering. ","","","","","Neighborhood preservation","","Neighborhood preservation in terms of keeping in place the zoning that maintains these communities as primarily one-family houses with low density. Understanding NYC has an affordable housing shortage, the residents in QCB13 have left these densely populated areas specifically to live in neighborhoods with yards, trees, homeowners and peace and quiet. It is the reason our communities look and sound the way they do. This impetus for Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs), basement apartments, and other ideas for creating more housing is totally anathema to our residents. What might work in one community does not necessarily work in another. The city should not have a ""one size fits all"" policy when it comes to the affordable housing crunch.","A prevalent issue is homeowners creating their own parking by paving over front yards and creating illegal curb cuts. Providing a budget for more inspectors can assist in addressing this growing problem. ","- More funding to be proactive in sealing up abandoned ""zombie"" houses. - Maintaining construction fences around the abandoned properties. - Maintaining the yards of abandoned properties. - Support programs that convert properties into affordable housing. - The removal of squatters from abandoned properties.  - Maintain support of foreclosure legal services. ","Our commercil strips are not nearly as vibrant with many stores - both mom& pop and chain - boarding up. The only new businesses seem to be a proliferation of smoke shops and many applications to open up Cannabis Dispensaries.  Some restaurants are hanging on -  but things remain tough. Small businesses are going to need assistance  learning how to compete with online shopping through making their stores more attractive, diversification and partnering with other businesses on their strip to capture more foot traffic.  ","","","","","Traffic safety and enforcement (cars, scooters, ebikes, etc.)","","QCB13 is inundated with requests for traffic mitigation measures. Speeding along residential streets has become a huge problem. More funding is needed so studies may be quickly completed, and more crews are available for the installation of speed humps, STOP signs and potentially, traffic signals. In addition, with the opening of the UBS Arena in the east and an Amazon Distribution facility in the southwest, we will need to monitor the increased vehicular traffic and how it affects the neighboring communities.","- Many of our neighborhoods are requesting traffic calming, specifically speed humps and stop signs. These traffic calming methods will slow traffic and provide more pedestrian safety.  - General maintenance along the grassy areas next to the highways is a problem. On one side of the fence is DOT, the other DPR oftentimes working with DSNY. Managing or coordinating between the two often is not very efficient. ","","","","","","Park care and maintenance","","The staff presently assigned to the Board's parks do an excellent job. During the summer when the parks are used more extensively, additional staff  and equipment for both maintenance and safety would vastly increase the overall enjoyment of these recreational areas. There are equipment needs for this area that need to be addressed to keep up with the usage.","The parks and playgrounds in the district have varying needs as detailed below. Many of the MPAA areas need resurfacing, as these areas need some creativity in determining what sporting activities can be encouraged with the decline in the play of asphalt softball. In addition, better scheduling for use of grass fields with baseball, soccer and cricket.  In addition, the district has a large number of trees the city is reponsible to maintain. Every week there are numerous request for either tree pruning or repairs for sidewalks uplifted by tree roots. More funding is needed to address these safety issues. ","No comments","No comments","Community Boards have moved forward 10 years technologically in having to meet virtually and utilizing new equipment and software to do things differently. There will be occassons when we meet in-person when community boards may need to hire outside contractors. Additional funding for these new needs is necessary going forward to keep up with the increasing tecnological demands.

It has at least 13 distinct communities, each with its own name, neighborhoods, interests and problems bound together by a common geography and history, which is both written and hidden. From a westerly to easterly direction, we point to Breezy Point, Rockaway Point, Neponsit, Belle Harbor, Rockaway Park, Rockaway Beach, Arverne/Sommerville, Edgemere, Arverne by the Sea, Bayswater , Wavecrest and Far Rockaway and Broad channel Island. The Rockaways is some eleven miles in length and is three quarters of a mile wide. With its multi-ethnic, multi-religious groupings, the concerns of the poor, the aged, the young and needy is often termed a microcosm of New York City. Patterns of housing are equally diverse with evidence of affluence in the western and most eastern sections of the district. And large concentrations of public housing and publicly assisted housing in between.  THe board has concerns regarding Climate change and sea level rise on our communities the City must do more to protect our homes and businesses . We have a greater concern regarding the back bay communities along Jamacia Bay. With the near completion of the ""Downtown Far Rockaway"" Plan and other new housing projects  that will start in the next year it is clear that two new schools will be needed in 11691/92 to  meet the needs of the  over 10,000 units of new affordable housing , the board would also like to see amore gifted and talented school created within the district specifically . The board  also strongly feels that the CIty of NY needs to do more to prevent drownings on our beaches. The creation of a water safety and swim program for ALL school age children would help save lives. We are deeply concerned that with all the new housing to be built ,Downtown Far Rockaway, Arverne East, Peninsula hospital  housing development site among others with over  10,000 new units-   the flow of traffic will be rendered to a stand still- we only have two east-west roadways and currently traffic during rush hour or summer weekends is difficult . With the anticipated housing development and an additional 3500-5000 new cars on the road every day  The Department of transportation needs to look at the whole district to assure better flow of traffic.With that in mind the City must conduct a traffic study before the over 10,000 new units become occupied, The traffic study done in the EIS for these projects were cursory at best   The CIty/HPD must keep its commitment  made in 1997 to  widen Edgemere ave/Rockaway Beach Blvd to two lanes in each direction with turning lanes from Beach 62-Seagirt Blvd . This important roadway improvement is need to deal with the estimated 5000 new cars on this road daily as well as it is one of two evacuation routes. THe CIty has allowed the Development team of Arverne East to just widen 5 blocks which will create a bottle neck on the roadway. The City/OEM must work with the community to create a sensible,well marked evacuation route for all areas of the District.Finally  the need for more police officers in both the 100 and 101 Pcts is needed to provide adequate protection considering the projected 20% increase in our population in the next 3 years .Our beach season  has  seen a major increase every year , a larger  summer police detail in both 100 and 101 Pcts is needed as well as additional PEP officers assigned to CB14 to deal with the record breaking beach crowds every summer. We also request more summer Parks maintainance  staff to deal with large summer crowds. Our district remains as having the highest unemployment rate in the borough of Queens. Much more needs to be done to create entry and mid level jobs locally.Better mass transportation service is a must. The MTA must construct more ADA accessible A train stops with the installation of elevators at 3-4 locations along the A line within the district. ","","","","","Crime and Public Safety","","With ever increasing beach crowds and tourism  and the approval of over 10,000 new affordable housing units  and over 20-30,000 new residents more Police officers, EMS, Parks PEP and Fire personnel   will be needed.","Infrastructure resiliency","","Flooding-It has become clear that after hurricane SANDY that protection from flooding is a major concern .communities in our district  that face Jamaica Bay are in constant jeopardy from high tides, storm surge and heavy rains.  Bulk heads, street raising and storm sewers must be installed along  Rockaways  northern boarder and through out Broad Channel.  Public Health- With the closing of Peninsula Hospital, St johns hospital has become over crowded and unable to handle the load . A typical wait in the emergency room exceeds 5 hours and a wait for a bed can be over a day this must be dealt with A tier 2 or 3 trauma center needs to be located in CB14 . We also have been deeply disappointed in the NYC Dept of health's  refusal to implement a program of the spraying/fogging of adulticide to deal with summer mosquito problem.  Street Conditions-  CB14 has experienced an large increase in summer tourism. This has caused traffic problems through out the district.  Our roads remain in poor condition after hurricane SANDY. The expansion of Rockaway Beach blvd/Edgemere Ave from Beach 62-Beach 32/Seagirt Blvd MUST be designed and funded this road way remains dangerous and over used and is one of two main east-west roadways used for hurricane evacuation- This vital roadway must be widened to two lanes in each direction with turning lanes.","Transit (buses & subways)",""," Getting to and from Community board 14 is a Transportation nightmare - We are poorly served by mass transportation- the ferry has helped but does not serve the residents on the East end of the district- we request a AM/PM rush hour express train on the A-  3-4  AM/PM Rockaway  rush  express trains  to and from Manhattan would drastically reduce the over 1 hour commute. the re opening of the Rockaway rail line would also be a great  help. Access for the disabled at more subway stops must be constructed-  additional elevators for A line stops is vital for our residents and visitors","","","","","Health facilities","","With increase in population the need for a local Trauma center is vital as well as improved Emergency room capacity","The Board would like additional funding for expansion and staffing for primary health care and emergency health care.

The City is placing thousands of affordable units with no real effort  to spur economic development to create jobs for our new neighbors.  With  over 20,000 new residents expected in the next 3 years  , Our local hospital will not be able to handle the burden nor is our public transportation adequate to deal with the drastic increase.  The City in its rush to create more affordable housing has not agreed to conduct a new Environmental Impact study for Arverne East. It appears that   City hall  has forgone good planning measures  for the expediency of creating thousands of units of housing.

There is an increased vitality to the district engendered by the aggregation of one billion dollars in private investment coupled with the Mayor's Bay Street Corridor Affordable Housing Plan. However, unless the City commits to extensive infrastructure improvements the tax revenues from Lighthouse Point, the Navy Pier and Empire Outlets current tenancy will be at risk and the Bay Street Corridor Affordable Housing Plan will fail, especiall since building height will not give developers the returns needed to constuct such affordable units. The streets require massive reinvestment to prevent quick deterioration and to provide sensible access to the venues and to downtown St. George, including the new court complex. A new traffic timing algorithm needs to be written to make sense of the poorly configured current traffic light controls. The Wagner property at Howard Avenue and Clove Road must be purchased to create a turning lane, thus leaving two travel lanes and a left turn lane. Mass transit will be a must and has to consist of SIRTOA improvents, SBS and BRT service and a dedicated busway along Richmond Terrace. Zoning along the corridor from Snug Harbor to Stapleton needs to be amended from M to C4-2 which would allow the development of afordable housing in a larger part of the Board's district. The funds provided by DFTA and DYCD require a substantial increases to the S.I. allocation to meet the needs S.I.'s expanding senior population and the needs of our now very diverse population of youngsters with special attention focused on drug addiction prevention and on increased recreational programming for the young ones, and, especially, early identification of and treatment for children with disabilities. Since there is no HHC full service hospital in the borough, NYC needs to alocate a proportionally fair amount of tax levied funds to the two S.I. hospital systems. The Board has tasked our Health Committee with the job of working with the Borough President and our health care service providers to ""create a culture of wellness."" The Board is grateful to the HHC for building an ""Urgi-care"" facility in the underserved Clifton/Park Hill community; however, while this is a step in the right direction, it is not curative of the underlying lack of NYC support to the borough's hospital systems. The dramatic economic growth linked with the Bay Street Affordable Housing plan will make public safety more complex and will require an increase in NYPD staffing and construction of the new 120th precinct in Stapleton. This growth, and the growth in St. George will require a proximate siting of a fully staffed and equipped house for FDNY. The quality of life for SICB1's district will be enhanced by providing DPR with an equitable base line capital budget to improve and upgrade all the parks in SICB1, increase PEP staffing, provide restrooms in all DPR public facilities and develop the North Shore Greenway Trail. While the Board applauds and thanks our elected officials for providing funding to DPR, it is unfair these official have to use resources for an agency when other agencies have their own capital funding. Most importantly, Parks needs at least $130 million to rebuild Cromwell Center over Lyon's Pool. The North Shore Bluebelt or its hard infrastructure alternative and the Victory Boulevard sewer need $20-$30 million to stop the endless flooding within the communities from Westerleigh to West New Brighton. Finally, the Board looks forward to the relocation of the DOS District 1 garage from the environmental justice community along Jersey and Brook Streets to the appropriate location within the old landfill. Thereafter, the Board will encourage adaptive reuse of the DS1 site. ","","","","","Land use trends","","North Shore zoning neither reflects current land use nor wisely prepares for future land use. M zones abut R zones, parking requirements do not reflect the Borough's reality of auto use, C zones are poorly sited, affordable housing corridors do not exist, there are no transit corridors, there is no thought of preservation and,our open spaces are being obliterated and the waterfront is not being used for industrial, job creating, purposes ","Traffic","","The biggest impediment to the quality of life on Staten Island is  traffic  The DOT cannot keep pace with the increasing use of vehicles and contrary to Manhattan-centric thinking vehicles are the only way to get around out here.  There is no grid system,  the roads are in disrepair, commutes are endless, shopping is an ordeal, school buses are slow and there is only one small rail system.","Transit (buses & subways)","","Commuting on SI is hell.  Every bus has to trundle for miles on broken roads to deliver folks to work and children to school.  Bus schedules do not meet commuters"" needs, express service is inadequate, the BRT plan proposes to eliminate access to the ferry terminal and the SIRR only serves a small part of the Borough.","","","","","Other - Write In (Required)",""," Equitable Hospital Services and support.  SI has no Municipal Hospital and there is no allowance made to help fiance the operations of the two hospital systems on the Island.  This lack of funding either for a municipal hospital or to help the two systems is a disregard by leadership for the health and well being of the Staten Island community, especially in CB1 where there are more residents in medical distress than in other parts of the Island. ","Again, as stated often in this section, the health care system on Staten Island does not receive equitable funding thus placing all residents at risk.","The two biggest needs in the district are affordable housing and abuse prevention programming.","Although the homeless population has increased and diversified, the resources given to our one agency are inadequate to provide housing, shelter, prevention, referrals and counseling.","Job training and employment programming and domestic abuse prevention are the most significant programs the district needs.","","","","","Remote learning and technology","","The Hunan virus has devastated our youngsters ability to learn and grow.  It especially harms those lacking resouces to technology and the D.O.E. must find a way to get working connectivity and equipment to those youngsters needing the same.","The increased economic and housing actifvity in our district and the closing of most parochial schools is causing and untoward burden on a public system that already has most schools at over-capacity.","The district needs additonal day care to allow parents the opportunity to work.","","","","","Public safety facilities (precinct, fire houses, etc.)","","The current 120 Precinct is outmoded and an impediment to traffic access around downtown St. George.  NYPD owns property on Hill Street and should locate the precinct there.","Therre is a need fo vertical patrols in our housing comlexes and a need for CPOP-like patrols in our other residential and commercial communities,","The redevelopment of St. George and Stapleton along with the implementation of the Affordable Housing program as well as the increased response times caused by the awful traffic conditions is creating an urgent need for a new FDNY facility.","","","","","Water runoff and flooding","","Several areas need storm sewers to prevent property destruction and flooding.","The North Shore Bluebelt and the Victory Boulevard and the Forest Avenue drainage areas must be sewered to stop the endless flooding therein.","DoS service is excellent and the Board is thankful to Commissioner Garcia and Councilwoman Rose that District 1 will be relocating!","","","","","Land use and zoning","","All your listed items are predicated upon appropriate zoning and the district is lacking in that regard.  The zoning throughout Rosebank, Shore Acres and Fort Wadsworth needs amending and the zoning from Snug Harbor to the Ferry needs to be changed to C4-2.    The Bay Street Corridor Affordable Housing Program will fail unless there is concurrent infrastructure development.","The district is an uneven collection of M zones within and beside R zones and the R zones are an uneven array of categories.  Affordable housing, area stability and appropriate land use requires zoning reflective of good planning and careful needs assessment.","There is a great need for affordable housing and for senior housing.","The district is primed for about a one billion dollar private sector investment which will require the EDC to make corresponding investment to the infrastructure from the NY Wheel site to the Navy Pier site, including creating connectivty from Stapleton to the Homeport.  Furthermore, the EDC will have to negotiate land swaps and ROW usages to create the North Shore Grenway Heritage Trail and to allow for the creation of an SBS or BRT dedicated route along the old ROW.    The development of BID's and the support for small businesses, incubators and art oriented development will need to be a preeminent part of all future economic develpopment plans.","","","","","Traffic safety and enforcement (cars, scooters, ebikes, etc.)","","Staten Island has congested unkempt roadways, poor signal coordination, poorly imagined bike lanes and too many vehicles.  The result of these factors causes poor driving habits, accidents and danger to pedestrians and bike riders.","Street conditions, traffic flow, BRT lanes, smart lights and bulkhead improvents in St. George and Rosebank are required.","SBS and BRT services, local fleet increases and scheduling increases to the SIRTOA coupled with station reconstruction of the Stapleton station.","","","","","Library facilities and access","","Rosebank is a large and growing area without a library.","Along with Cromwell, the DPR should be allocated a dedicated base line budget of at least $100 million and $17 million to acquire the last phase of the Goodhue property.","The base line funding for both small cultural groups and CIG's needs to be increase to allow service to keep up with population growth.","The libraries have been heavily used and require  not only facility repair and equipment purchases but also staff additions and program expansions.

Our geographic district comprises Willowbrook, Todt Hill, Dongan Hills, Midland Beach, New Dorp, Arrochar, Old Town, Grasmere, Manor Heights, Bloomfield, Chelsea, Travis, Heartland Village, New Springville, Bulls Head, and Lighthouse Hill. Staten Island is primarily made up of one and two-family houses and many thriving businesses. Each town is proud of its unique qualities and individual characteristics which residents strive to maintain. The boundaries are from the Staten Island Expressway from the Verrazzano Narrows Bridge south along the narrows to New York Harbor (which include Hoffman and Swinburne Islands) to Ebbitts Street west to Jason Street.  Tysens Lane to Amboy Road, Richmond Road to St. Patrick's Place to Clarke Avenue across Arthur Kill Road, to eastern boundary of LaTourette Park, and southern and eastern boundary to Richmondtown Restoration to southern boundary of LaTourette Park, to West Shore Expressway.  Half mile north on Expressway to Fresh Kills Creek including Prall's Island to Arthur Kill. Our area consists of single and two family homes, townhouses, three NYC Housing Authority developments, several six-story apartment complexes, co-ops and garden apartments. Community Board #2 is one of the city's last growth areas. Growth calls for delivery of city services in a timely manner.  We find that due to former cutbacks in the city, most agencies are still operating bare-boned and find it difficult to respond to minor complaints as quickly as we would like.  Major complaints are responded to the board almost immediately, but quality of life issues have been taking longer than we like. The stability of our district depends greatly on the viability of its commercial sectors and housing stock. Community Board 2 is fortunate to have concerned, energetic and devoted citizens who work actively to maintain the stability of our area. Our board has supported, assisted and participated in activities that will continue to do so for the betterment of our district.   There are two (2) Business Improvement Districts in Community Board 2's District, and one Merchant's Association.  The West Shore Industrial Business District is located on the West Shore of Staten Island in the Bloomfield and Chelsea sections, bordering the neighborhood of Travis. It includes properties broadly bounded by Bloomfield Avenue to the north, the Arthur Kill to the west, Meredith Avenue to the south, and the West Shore Expressway to the east. The West Shore BID provides much needed services including private maintenance, private security, signage and wayfinding, advocacy on behalf of property owners and important infrastructure improvements.  The BID contains over 72 parcels of land predominately developed with open industrial uses and relatively few buildings. The area of the BID is approximately 230 acres. About half of the overall BID acreage (approximately114 acres) are occupied by 42 private businesses/uses; 25 are engaged in industrial or transportation (60%); 13 are engaged in commercial businesses (30%); and one is non-profit use (2.4%). Area businesses include bus parking and servicing, construction companies, auto storage and repair and cement production. About 13% of the land (approximately 30 acres) consists of vacant but developable private property. The BID also includes about 98.12 acres of publicly owned land owned by either New York City or New York State. There are no residential units in the district. The area does not have sanitary or storm sewers and many streets are in disrepair and subject to frequent flooding The New Dorp Business Improvement District (BID), consists of a group of 180 businesses and 146 properties in a mile-long stretch along New Dorp Lane, from Hylan Boulevard to Richmond Road, and on New Dorp Plaza, from Beach Avenue to Jacques Avenue. The Richmond Road Merchants Association has been formed to help improve the Dongan Hills/Grant City commercial district that includes more than 75 businesses along the stretch of Richmond Road from Delaware Avenue to Stobe Avenue. These neighborhood enrichment development efforts have enhanced over 1,000 businesses by providing a variety of services including sanitation, security, events and beautification.    The Board plays an important advisory role, mandated in the New York City Charter, Community Board 2's primary responsibilities include the following:   	Hold public meetings regarding zoning and land use matters, proposed liquor license applications, transportation infrastructure proposals and other community matters. 	Provide formal input in the City's Uniform Land Use Review Procedure (ULURP), liquor license applications, Board of Standards and Appeals applications, requests for Certificates of Appropriateness from the Landmarks Preservation Commission and many other matters. 	Monitor service delivery to assure that agencies are responsive to the district. 	Resolve complaints on behalf of residents with City agencies regarding services. 	Prepare capital and expense budget priority requests and respond to the Mayor's  Preliminary Budget.   Members of Community Board 2 volunteer to represent the interests of the district's residents, institutions, organizations and businesses.       ","","","","","Crime and Public Safety","","School Safety is Community Board 2’s number 1 priority again this year.  There is an ever-increasing demand to protect schools from threats of violence. It is important to take this threat seriously and responsibly.  Community Board 2 requests that (1) every school door is locked at all times, (2) install metal detectors, (3) install a camera aimed at the front door so visitors are visible, and at all exit doors,  (4) install a buzzer system, (5) place an NYPD officer at the front desk by the front door not a school safety agent (5) have a school Safety Agent stationed at each door inside the building, and (6) have NYPD presence outside the school building during dismissal to harden building security. School safety measures must be improved immediately. As we all know, school safety plays a vital role in the development of the emotional health and academic success of young people. School shootings are terrifying to children, parents, educators and the community. ""School Safety"" has been defined as creating a safe environment for children, starting from their homes to their schools and back. This includes safety from any kind of abuse, violence, psycho-social issue, disaster, natural and manmade, fire, and transportation. The physical and mental wellbeing of every child left at the front entrance of a school, must be protected. With the rise in mental illness, schools should provide two or more mental health professionals in every intermediate school on Staten Island.   Provide safety trainings for principals, assistant principals and response team leaders in the case of an emergency.  With a rise in mental illness, it may be wise to have two mental health professionals in every Intermediate school on Staten Island.  Also, provide each school safety agent with a bullet-resistant vest to protect the guards posted at Staten Island schools. ","Infrastructure resiliency","","A top priority for our district is the commercial revitalization and development of the East Shore of Staten Island.  It is well-known that the East Shore of Staten Island sustained severe damage from Hurricane Sandy.  Residential revitalization, as well as storm damage mitigation programs, have been well underway, but there is still a lot of work that needs to be done in regards to commercial development. With an eye to attract business owners to the area, it is essential that sidewalk improvement, street improvement, and signage projects are implemented. Sidewalk improvement needs for the East Shore are increased street furniture and lighting (i.e city benches, ornamental solar lights on street trees, holiday lighting on the main commercial corridors) and enhancement of greenery of streets (i.e. street trees, tree guards, rain gardens, bioswales).  Street improvement needs include enhanced traffic calming measures, medians and pedestrian refuge islands. Other improvements that will beautify the area are creating a gateway between the beach and commercial corridors (i.e. gateway public art sculpture on Father Capodanno Boulevard), creating a pedestrian pathway connecting the FDR Boardwalk to Father Capodanno at Midland Avenue, and creating shared space around Fountain of the Dolphins.  ","Public health facilities","","Staten Island is the only borough in New York City without a public hospital. There are only two private hospitals on Staten Island.  Every other borough has two.  In 1970, Staten Island had five hospitals. Staten Island currently has two main hospital systems and three main hospital facilities – Staten Island University North and South, and Richmond University Hospital  With the growing and aging population, homeless shelters opening and migrants arriving in Staten Island, there is a need for a public hospital in the Mid-Island section of the borough. Also, the COVID-19 pandemic was an eye-opener.  We must be prepared and well-equipped for natural and human caused disasters. The residents of Mid-Island are geographically disadvantaged due to the longer commute times to get to the hospitals. New York City needs to build a public hospital to better serve its neglected community and residents","","","","","Health facilities","","Senior advocates estimate that by 2040, New York’s 60+plus population will increase to 1.86 million. By 2040, boomers will be part of the oldest population group. Staten Island is also projected to have the greatest senior population in New York City by 2030. As the population ages, we need to be able to provide services to ensure that resources are available to give our seniors the quality of life they deserve.  Elder abuse protection, housing, healthcare, senior centers, and many other support systems must be enhanced and continued to meet the needs of our growing senior population. And, as the senior population grows, additional and appropriate placement of services is needed. There is not only the need to increase senior services, but also to advocate for managed long-term care companies to better evaluate client’s needs so they can be placed in the appropriate care setting. Guidelines should look for criteria that evaluate medical, psychological, and social needs.  Our growing aging population requires more funding and more services for our seniors. ","Sea View Hospital Rehabilitation Center and Home located at 460 Brielle Avenue, is the only city-hospital on Staten Island, however, it does not provide acute healthcare for our residents. Our three private healthcare institutions are overburdened by those without healthcare insurance.  There is a need to restore Sea View Hospital Rehabilitation Center and Home's vacant buildings.  We request full funding for the restoration.  ","The city should do an inventory (identify) of large city-owned parcels of land and determine what can be turned over to responsible developers to construct affordable senior housing for purchase similar the 55+ developments built in New Jersey.  This type of housing will enable seniors to connect with neighbors of similar ages and continue to enjoy retirement years in a safe and peaceful environment.    ","No comments","No comments","","","","","Other - Write In (Required)","","School safety is our number one priority. Form a School Emergency Response Team (SERT). The school emergency response team (SERT) is responsible for the safety of students and staff during dangerous situations. Emergency situations such as hurricanes, earthquakes, medical emergencies, and active shooters are examples of situations that pose an immediate threat. Emergencies, whether natural disasters or man-made situations, come on suddenly and unexpectedly, SERT members are trained to be alert and prepared to activate the emergency response plan. Emergency professionals working with OSHA (the Occupational Safety and Health Administration), FEMA (the Federal Emergency Management Agency) and U.S. Homeland Security help schools prepare their emergency plans and create a SERT with defined roles. When emergencies strike, the personnel on-scene are the best line of protection and defense. Prior to the arrival of the NYPD or FDNY, the designated emergency response team can handle emergency situations.   ","School-based crime prevention programs can be very effective. Kids will make good decisions if they have the right principles installed in their thinking. The NYC Department of Education should consider incorporating the N.O.V.A. principles to their curriculum for fifth grade through high school.  N.O.V.A. stands for ""Nurturing youth to seek out positive Opportunities, internalize good Values, and to accept Accountability for their choices in life.  N.O.V.A. was designed to provide a resource to children, families, and communities to fight against harmful influences, while providing guidance toward positive opportunities and values.""  ","Over 48,000 students on Staten Island are eligible for an Individualized Education Program (IEP) yet due to the shortage of special education services in Staten Island schools, and the lack of on-site providers, parents are given Related Service Authorization (RSA) vouchers, which places the burden on parents to find a provider, coordinate services, and transport their child or children to the provider. Roughly 27% of the eligible students did not utilize their RSA vouchers and receive the services they need and are entitled to because of the burden placed on the parent to find providers who have availability. The RSA voucher program does not work for students, parents, or schools, and is leading to the neglect of students with disabilities. It is essential for the New York City Department of Education to re-evaluate its reliance on RSA vouchers and find a way to provide for all students."" In addition to re-evaluating the RSA voucher programs, Community Board 2 would like to request an increase in IEP program specialized teachers in our district schools.  Provide funding for Careers and Technical Education (CTE). CTE Schools are an overlooked and under-funded part of the school system. CTE Programs in NYC are clustered in the very industries most at risk of facing shortages. CTE schools have enormous potential to help fill a pipeline of skilled workers in job titles from healthcare professionals and airline mechanics to carpenters and opticians. We need to prepare young people for higher education and careers. As baby boomers begin to retire in large numbers, we face the prospect of serious worker shortages in high-impact economic sectors like health care and construction. By 2025, we will have a shortage of 500,000 nurses. ","","","","","Public nuisance (noise, other disturbances)","","Community Board 2 would like to see the enforcement of noise complaints transitioned to a specific enforcement unit outside of the NYPD. CB2 also requests that any unit responding to complaints be provided with the necessary noise measuring equipment. Having this equipment at hand will allow enforcement action to be addressed immediately. When Community Board #2 receives a complaint about nightlife noise and amplified sound, sometimes as late as 2:00 am in residential areas, we advise the complainant(s) to call 311 and fill out the complaint form on the NYS Liquor Authority's Website. As you know, the New York City Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) is the lead agency responsible for enforcing the City’s Noise Code. However, nightlife noise can be difficult to control and regulate. Nightlife noise has clear criteria to guide government oversight, yet calling 311 does not resolve the issue.  DEP does not send an inspector to the establishment when the disturbance is happening, and this type of complaint is not a priority for the NYPD. We  need to protect the quality of life of all residents and workers in the district. ","","CB2 supports full funding for all fire and emergency medical services in our district and citywide. ","","","","","Protective infrastructure (sea walls, flood walls, etc.)","","The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ plans to build a 5.3-mile Seawall that stretches from Fort Wadsworth to Oakwood Beach which is intended to protect Staten Island's East Shore from coastal storms was supposed to be completed by 2021. For years, this project has been delayed.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers now estimates that the five-plus-mile, East Shore Seawall won’t be finished until the end of 2026. This is totally unacceptable.  It is imperative that this project moves forward with no further delays. Each delay adds millions of dollars to the cost of construction.  And, the homeowner's flood insurance premiums go up every year - one homeowner reported last year that he paid $34,000 for flood insurance in 2020. This is very disturbing.  The USACE needs to make this project their top priority and figure out how to get this project started and finished sooner than 2026.  Staten Islanders have waited long enough and need relief!  ","Public infrastructure, including sewers, drainage, and roads, need fixing in the West Shore. Without these upgrades, the West Shore will not be able to grow and attract new business over time. Many streets are in dire need of improvement. The streets in dire need of improvement are Gulf Avenue between 5th Street and Edward Curry Avenue; Bloomfield Avenue between Gulf Avenue and Chelsea Road; Edward Curry Avenue between Gulf Avenue and Chelsea Road; Chelsea Road between Bloomfield Avenue and South Avenue; South Avenue between Chelsea Road and Meredith Avenue; The entirety of Industry Road; The entirety of Spencer Street Meredith Avenue from the northern limit to the West Shore Expressway overpass. Without infrastructure improvements to streets within the district, the West Shore will not be able to grow to its potential.  Many sites on the West Shore have poor drainage systems and a lack of sewers. Lack of adequate drainage and standing water remain pervasive and recurrent problems. To date, property owners have not been able to even get septic tanks due to the proximity of the protected wetlands to some property. While one industrial business in the area does own its own sewage treatment plant, the others do not, and this may be another option to explore. Property owners and community stakeholders agree that installing sewers in the West Shore will enhance curb appeal, increase property value, attract new tenants to vacant land, and assist the industrial businesses to better serve their customers.  The Bloomfield area of Staten Island which has no sewer system and was never included in the City drainage plan, needs sewers. Several years ago, NYC Department of Environmental Protection did a study to update the City drainage plan to include sewers in Bloomfield, including the streets listed above.  Unfortunately, a Bluebelt was not feasible, so the plan included a new DEP sewage pump station and many street raisings that NYC Department of Transportation would have to fund. That would make this area very expensive to build sewers in, and DEP needs DOT to evaluate its own costs and decided if they want to fund the project.  Advocating and securing the City of New York's commitment to install proper drainage systems and sewers in the Bloomfield area is imperative to the successful operation of all businesses in the area. ","Community Board 2 is responsive to residents' concerns about sanitation issues and the environment. The cleanliness of our streets and neighborhoods is of great importance to our entire community.  Streets littered with garbage deter investment and create a perception that an area is neglected and unsafe. When quality-of life issues such as sanitation and maintenance are not addressed, other economic development initiatives do little to attract businesses and consumers to a given commercial corridor. We support frequent sanitation inspections and efforts to maintain clean-swept sidewalks and streets ","","","","","Neighborhood preservation","","Our growing aging population requires more funding and more services for our seniors. Advocates project that 1 in 5 New Yorkers will be over the age of 65 in 2030. Staten Island is also projected to have the largest aging population in New York City by 2030. As the population ages, we need to be able to provide services to ensure the safety and well-being of our senior population. The developmental trends within District 2 will help address these issues. The previously planned former Farm Colony would provide much needed senior-targeted housing and create a new district that compliments and enhances the surrounding community. This residential community would be located on Brielle Avenue. It would contain approximately 350 residential units, 17,000 square feet of commercial space, as well as a central green space and accessory parking. The Sea View Senior Living Center will create much-needed senior-housing and provide quality care for many of the area residents. This center will be used for both assisted living and non-assisted services and as a community center for our senior population.","No comments","","","","","","","Roadway maintenance","","Potholes are an ongoing problem which exasperate drivers across Staten Island.  Potholes are common in areas where there is heavy traffic and Staten Island is inundated with heavy traffic.  Year-round pothole repair crews are a necessity. Having pothole repair crews available only during the off-season for milling and paving is unacceptable.  The roads get potholes year-round and must be fixed year-round.  Staten Island should have at least three pothole repair crews to maintain the roadways before they cause damage.    Also, an additional in-house markings crew and other Borough Engineering field staff and materials are needed to install and maintain signs and verticle elements.  Another important issue is the condition of bus stops.  Many of the bus stops within District 2 remain without lighting and are located in a wooded, dark, or desolate areas. This proposes as a safety issue putting commuters at risk of contracting West Nile Virus, tick bites, and at risk of being struck by a moving vehicle that does not see the commuter. There are bus stops along the stretch of Victory Boulevard from Arlene Street eastbound toward the West Shore Expressway that do not have sidewalks, which forces commuters to wait in the street or in the woods, both of which pose safety hazards.  ","There is a need to develop an innovative Pavement Plan that utilizes sophisticated engineering data collection and analysis along with economic analyses that consider pavement performance, costs/benefits, vehicle travel, and long-range system optimization under limited funding scenarios.  Paved areas with no drainage means the water has nowhere to go and often floods and overflows to everything around it.  Additionally, redesign the pavement treatment plan to reduce the current 15-20-year paving schedule. ","A major issue regarding transit service is the complete lack of connectivity to surrounding airports. In Queens, there are four buses available for residents to access LaGuardia Airport. An overwhelming majority of Staten Island residents who fly go through Newark Airport. Residents taking public transportation to Newark airport are required to go through Penn Station or Port Authority Bus Terminal; a commute that is likely over two hours long.  Community Board 2 continues to support the development of a West Shore Light Rail system. The West Shore of Staten Island is on its way to becoming Island's Business Hub. We are home to an 855,000 square-foot Amazon Fulfillment Center that employs over 2,250 people. Furthermore, the Nicotra Group constructed a 330,000 square foot Century Office Building on Staten Island's Teleport Campus. These huge construction projects created more vehicles and trucks traversing the West Shore Expressway. A West Shore Light Rail system could provide a reliable and attractive travel choice for Staten Island residents located in South Shore and Mid-Island communities. The WSLR would extend New Jersey Transit's Hudson-Bergen Light Rail system (HBLRT) over the Bayonne Bridge and into western and southern portions of Staten Island and connect to SIRTOA service at the Richmond Valley Station. The benefits of Light Rail are: Trips are diverted from congested roadways, saves travel time, improves reliability, and increases property values near stations. SIEDC estimates that the area will be home to 65,000 new residents by 2030. ","","","","","Access to and quality of cultural programming","","There are plenty of noble reasons for supporting our local cultural institutions.  The Jacques Marchais Museum of Tibetan Art was established in 1945 to promote a greater understanding and appreciation of Tibetan art and culture. The Museum presents a permanent historic display as well as temporary changing exhibitions. The Museum also presents an on-going calendar of public events including lectures, films, tai chi classes, and school visits. They welcome approximately 5,000 visitors per year, half of whom are foreign tourists. The buildings that house the Tibetan Museum are the oldest examples of Himalayan style architecture in the United States and they were designed so that visitors could appreciate the art in a contextual setting. The Alice Austen House has delivered educational programming to over 3,000 Staten Island elementary and middle school students both in-school and on-site education programs. It has also celebrated the anniversary of its National Historic Designation to include LGBTQ history as an area of significance with an event that spanned both afternoon and evening, celebrating the work of the New York City Parks Department, the LGBTQ Historic Sites Project and their community partners. The Alice Austen House serves our community and ensures that the legacy of Alice Austen is known to Staten Islanders and preserves this land-marked treasure in partnership with the New York City Parks Department. Snug Harbor Cultural Center and Botanical Garden provides a vibrant, regional cultural destination that offers dynamic programming in arts, education, horticulture, agriculture and recreation for diverse visitors of all ages while ensuring a well-managed campus for all stakeholders. The 83-acre campus is home to historic, landmarked buildings, the borough’s only botanical garden and a two-acre farm. Snug Harbor is a proud Smithsonian Affiliate and is home to multiple community based arts groups, artists, not-for-profits, and several large arts institutions. We would like the funding for the Staten Island Museum, the Staten Island Children’s Museum, Historic Richmond Town and the Staten Island Zoo continue so that the residents of and visitors to Staten Island have access to culture, nature, education and history. Historic Richmond Town is Staten Island's largest and oldest cultural institution, Historic Richmond Town possesses some of the most celebrated and storied historical items of American history. There are more than 100,000 artifacts, photographs, and archival collections from different time periods. The total number of individual objects or bits and pieces of history in our care is close to a million! Surrounding and containing our collections are original historic structures dating back as far as the 1660s. The GRACE Foundation is committed to supporting, educating, and enhancing the quality of life for children/adults and their families impacted by Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), which is a neurological disorder that impacts.","Our NYC Parks play a fundamental role in physical and mental health. As former Council Speaker Corey Johnson had said ""Parks are our backyards, front yards, our wellness centers, where we host birthday parties, family reunions, weddings and so much more.""  In the midst of COVID-19 Parks have remained accessible to Staten Islanders, and all New Yorkers. Access to parks and open spaces is vital to public health. It is important that Park's budget is not cut so the facilities is our borough are well maintained.       ","","It is imperiative that the Staten Island library systems be supported and adequately funded so their needs and the needs of the community are met. New York Public Libraries have provided quality service to all New Yorkers for more than a century.  City funding for libraries has been cut by nearly 20% over the past decade and library staff has been reduced by more than 1,000 workers. The NYPL libraries within CB2 (Staten Island) are used extensively. The community relies on them to provide essential library services, as well as educational programs and community space. Many of the library locations are in need of critical upgrades, including mechanical systems, bathrooms, roofs, facades, and ADA upgrades. The three library systems are seeking a restoration of $65 million in expense funding and the inclusion $1.4 billion in the City's 10-Year Capital Strategy. This capital funding is needed for renovations, critical maintenance, elevator replacement when necessary, heating and cooling systems, ADA compliance and technology upgrades. The funding is essential, as the libraries are especially important to low and moderate income residents who depend on the libraries for access to books, internet access, job search, and film, while also acting as a quiet place to read, do homework, or other work. Currently, the operational funding enables our libraries to be a stable and consistent resource for all New Yorkers, opening their doors at minimum six days per week and offering high[1] quality and diverse programming. We seek funding for our libraries to expand to 7-day services. Increased funding will ensure that at least one branch in every Council District is open 7 days. This is particularly important at this time, when more people than ever rely on library services, from early literacy to ESOL classes for immigrants and story times for homeless families ","No comments","","","","","Explanation","","","","","","","","","","SI2","","","","","","","","","","",""

We don't have tall buildings, but we are the borough of parks, and our population is just under 500,000. When an out-of-towner thinks of New York City, they'll probably think of giant skyscrapers and many crowded streets. While the south shore of Staten Island can get a bit crowded at times (traffic nightmares), it feels more like a suburb than part of the largest city in America. Residents experience the Big Apple without being overwhelmed; you can have a house with space to move around and a garden. An hour and 15 minutes to drive 7 miles? The tradeoff for our suburban qualities is our highways are persistently congested.  We have a meager transportation system, i.e., a limited one-track railway and buses. Insufficient transportation options are the catalyst for our car-dependent population. For the most part, our existing sanitary and storm sewer system is aged and time-worn.  Residents endure flooding due to a lack of stormwater management.   ","","","","","Land use trends","","We strongly object to any zoning changes that will increase residential density. We encourage economic development to strengthen our community.   Zoning should groom for economic development.  Zoning should develop solutions and create opportunities for communities to succeed by growing jobs through the location of economic development prospects that will create sustainable, livable, and thriving neighborhoods in our district. Our primary service infrastructure must receive the proper funding for roads, transportation services, and sewer systems to maintain our district. Essential city services in our neighborhoods are outdated and in disrepair. Communities do not prosper in a deteriorating environment, and they certainly cannot withstand increased density. ","Street flooding","","DEP should expand the City Drainage Plan incorporating perpetual flood-prone localities and up-and-coming new improvement development areas. Using a seepage basin instead of sewer-connected catch basins is not an effective short-term solution to persistent flooding issues. DEP’s website, Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System, clearly illustrates the south shore’s overlooked sectors. We want the DEP to help identify and update the City Drainage Plan and develop capital sewer projects in Staten Island. ","Traffic","","Our district’s forced dependence on motor vehicles for daily travel needs is undoubtedly created by the nonexistent public mass transit system appropriate for the needs of its residents. We've repeatedly said that our arterials are unsuitable for increased traffic volume.  Road congestion is a daily constant.  Our secondary roads lack appropriate structure for the unremitting large capacity they handle, producing premature road failure. The Staten Island Expressway and West Shore Expressway are commuters' worst nightmare.   Any event that causes vehicles to stop briefly leads to backups that last hours after the triggering incident has been cleared. And those incidents always lead to spillover tie-ups on surrounding streets.   Our only rail transit consists of the Staten Island Railway, a single direct line from St. George to Tottenville.  If you don't live within walking distance of a railway station, you must drive, park in residential neighborhoods, or use a Park & Ride. Express Bus commuters have been complaining for a decade about the service on the south shore.  NYC needs to explore other modes of transportation, such as a light rail, which is cost-effective and has less impact on our environment. Community Board 3 does not need re-configuring “road diets” for the sole purpose of providing bike lanes that may or may not be used by less than 1% of the population. We need left turn signals at intersections, not just lane markings, and improved traffic light timing to reduce traffic congestion.   DOT’s road diets have not improved safety, but they have contributed to traffic woes for our residents.  ","","","","","Mental health and substance abuse treatment and prevention programs","","According to the Special Narcotics Prosecutor for the City of New York, Staten Island is the borough with the second highest rate of drug fatalities. New York City should be spending dollars to develop educational prevention and awareness programs and programs encouraging rehabilitation for substance abuse. A vital precursor of substance use disorder is mental illness; we must address emotional and psychological health issues that lead to substance addiction and drug fatalities.  ","Fund education programs that encourage rehabilitation for substance abuse.  According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse ""NIDA ""Many individuals who develop substance use disorders (SUD) are also diagnosed with mental disorders, and vice versa.  We have all witnessed the trickle-down effect of untreated mental health disorders, which are addiction, homelessness, crime, and fatal overdoses.  We need programs that bring awareness to mental health in the public and private sectors.   The government should also support funding for not-for-profit organizations and government-provided services for mental health. ","Our seniors would benefit greatly by increasing the number of programs and services available on the south shore.  We need programs that enable older adults to remain in their homes independently and allow them to participate in family and community life.  Funding senior centers benefits our aging population and provides resources for meal and nutrition programs, health and wellness programs, counseling, social and recreational activities.  ","No comments","No comments","","","","","School and educational facilities (Capacity)","","The potential for an additional learning complex was created when the Charleston Retail Center was developed.  All of Staten Island would benefit if a technical/specialized high school were created.  Refer to 503199701C ","New York vocational public schools have an average math proficiency score of 81% (versus the New York public school average of 56%), and reading proficiency score of 86% (versus the 63% statewide average).    ","No comments","","","","","Public safety facilities (precinct, fire houses, etc.)","","The 123 Precinct is no longer a suitable size to house a precinct station house. This 100-year-old structure cannot be expanded at its current location. Lack of parking has been an issue for decades.  The site is not easily accessible and is located at the southern end of the district it serves.  The interior has been fabricated repeatedly to keep up with the needs.","A capital project should be planned to replace the 123rd Precinct, as this structure is 100 years old. Current conditions are overcrowding, insufficient workspace for officers/employees, and a severe parking shortage for NYPD vehicles.  Parking availability for visitors and the surrounding area is awful. ","Community Board 3 gives it's full support and advocates for all requests that will strengthen FDNY services to the Staten Island Community. ","","","","","Water runoff and flooding","","It has been reported that less than 5% of the DEP’s budget goes to sewers and it is perceptible that Staten Island’s ranking is low on the priority list. The lack of adequate sewer infrastructure to alleviate flooding during rainfalls is unacceptable and the city needs to appropriately prioritize it. DEP should expand the City Drainage Plan incorporating perpetual flood prone localities and up-and-coming new improvement development areas. Using seepage basis instead of sewer connected catch basins is not an effective short term solution to persistent flooding issues. A look at DEP’s website Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System clearly illustrates the south shore’s overlooked sectors. We request that DEP commit to identifying, updating the City Drainage Plan, and develop capital sewer projects in Staten Island.  ","Our budget requests repeatedly requests sewer projects in specific neighborhoods where we receive the most complaints. It should also be noted that Staten Island has only two Sewer Treatment Plants that run at full capacity. Our DEP Drainage Plan needs to be amended to reflect the current needs of the community. During storm events these treatment plants are often unable to handle the capacity and untreated water released into our tributaries. Our future development, whether commercial or residential, compels us to plan for an additional treatment plant on the south shore. ","Litter enforcement and lot cleanup programs are essential tools that will reduce litter.  They create an effective barrier to stop litter and improve the quality of life in our neighborhoods. Litter causes pollution, kills wildlife, spreads disease. ","","","","","Land use and zoning","","More and more City Planning ""DCP"" and Board of Standards and Appeals ""BSA"" applications test the limits of our zoning laws. We need DCP and the BSA to ensure that our zoning laws are upheld and prevent the disregard for zoning laws by issuing special permits and waivers.  On multiple occasions, we have verbally advised DCP that new text amendments for parking requirements and private roads should be codified. The permitting of private roads in development communities should be abolished. Private roads have long-term adverse effects on their residents and become a burden to the city to maintain when Homeowner Associations fail. Residential parking requirements are designed to discourage the use of motor vehicles, and commercial parking requirements need to meet the needs of the communities.  Parking spaces in commercial lots are too small; parking lanes are difficult to maneuver and create hazardous conditions for pedestrians and drivers.","Community Board 3 and its residents do not support zoning resolutions or text amendments that promote density. The Special South Richmond Development District was created to protect our neighborhoods; we vehemently oppose increasing height restrictions, special permits, waivers, or zoning text amendments that will increase density.  Residents desperately need infrastructure, i.e., road improvements, sewer upgrades, street flooding mitigation, and modern transportation choices.  Staten Island is a unique borough, and we disagree with NYC's centric zoning mindset. ","No comments","No comments","","","","","Other - Write In (Required)","","We endure roads that are fragmented, misaligned and poorly paved.  Our highways are persistently congested.  We have a meager transportation system i.e., a limited one-track railway and buses, which is the origin of our car decreed population.  Our requests for road reconstruction need to be fast tracked.   ","Traffic and transportation are the #1 complaints in our community. Our increased density and commercial growth are booming.  Our roads are a nightmare with misaligned streets and are doomed by past poor planning decisions. Our essential needs are road reconstruction, updated traffic signals that include left turn signals, and improved bus service on the south shore. A new Ferry service on the south shore and expanded Park & Ride facilities would also greatly reduce our traffic congestion. Community Board 3 also lacks sidewalks for pedestrians.  Overgrowth flowing onto our sidewalks and roadways is a constant issue. ","The South Shore of Staten Island has a desperate need for a fast ferry.    South Shore residents face some of the longest commute times in our country; they should have an alternative, and not have to rely on the MTA’s inadequate express bus service, or the SIRR which is unreliable.","","","","","Other - Write In (Required)","","Repeatedly, we request additional funding for Street Tree Maintenance Programs, and yet the problem gets worse every year.  The general maintenance strategy for storm-related downed tree removal, stump removal, and sidewalk repair due to street tree growth onto sidewalks or upheaval from a downed tree should have a real-time emergency response for corrective, preventive, or condition-based maintenance. The present-day insufficient street tree programs create hazardous environments for residents and trigger the risk of costly lawsuits.","We receive numerous complaints about various PARKS maintenance issues.
