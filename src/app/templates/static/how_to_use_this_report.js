      <p>This report is broadly structured as follows:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Overarching Community District Needs</strong><br /><br />
            Sections 1 â€“ 4 provide an overview of the community district and the top three pressing issues affecting this district overall as identified by the community board. Any narrative provided by the board supporting their selection of their top three pressing issues is included.<br />&nbsp;
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Policy Area-Specific District Needs</strong><br /><br />
          Section 5 is organized by seven distinct policy areas aligned with the service and program areas of city agencies. For each policy area, community boards selected the most important issue for their districts and could provide a supporting narrative. The policy area section also includes any agency-specific needs and a list of relevant budget requests submitted by the community board. If the community board submitted additional information outside of a specific policy area, it may be found in Section 6.<br />&nbsp;
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Community Board Budget Requests</strong><br /><br />
          The final section includes the two types of budget requests submitted to the City for the FY24&nbsp;budget cycle; one list for capital and another for expense budget requests. For each budget request, community boards were able to provide a priority number, explanation, location, and supporters. OMB remains the definitive source on budget requests submitted to city agencies.
